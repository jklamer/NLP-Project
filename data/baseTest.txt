non Thanks, barkeep.
non So what's bothering you today?
comp Computer, access power grid to 
comp security check point four on the 
comp Promenade
non That isn't necessary.
non THE HUNTER
non Our ritual requires it when a Tosk 
non is captured alive.
non All right let's go
non I'll be escorting the prisoner to 
non the transporter station.
non This is a security matter
non This is a Starfleet matter.  Orders 
non from Sisko.
non We'll see about that.
non THE HUNTER
non Do not trouble yourself.  My ship 
non can transport us.
non Nossir, that won't be necessary.  
non Good relations with other cultures 
non is our highest priority.  Commander 
non Sisko wants to make sure you 
non understand we're sorry we interfered 
non with your hunt.  The least we can do 
non is give you an official escort off 
non the station it's a token of 
non goodwill and respect in our society
non THE HUNTER
non Very well.
non Starfleet has no business taking 
non charge of a prisoner transport
non Calm down, Constable what are you 
non talking about
non I'm talking about your ordering 
non O'Brien to escort Tosk off the 
non station
non I didn't give him any orders at all
non Sisko to O'Brien
non SISKO'S COM VOICE
non Mister O'Brien, 
non report to Ops immediately.
non This way
non Glass jaw.  Now, I know why you wear 
non a helmet.
non Up there!
non THE HUNTER
non The hunt has resumed!
non C'mon your ship is ready
non Security reports a fight in the 
non Promenade apparently O'Brien set 
non him loose
non I'm showing someone in an access 
non conduit above Quark's two 
non lifeforms one's human
non they're heading out toward the 
non docking ring
non I'll seal off the adjoining 
non corridors they won't get far
non Constable
non There's no hurry.
non You are Tosk as well now, Oh Brien
non The Cardies made these conduits out 
non of two-meter thick duranium 
non composite I've never seen a 
non scanning device that could penetrate 
non it
non until now.
non C'mon, Tosk, just around that 
non corner and we're there
non THE HUNTER
non No.  He's mine.
non What happens now?
non The hunt goes on.
non You wish to come?
non No no I don't think so one 
non day as a Tosk is enough for me 
non and I have a wife and kid that 
non wouldn't fit too well into this 
non lifestyle
non Will your Federation punish you for 
non helping me?
non Maybe.  But if I know my Commander
non Hell, those guys wanted a hunt.  I 
non just gave them one.
non Go on, you better get out of here 
non while you can
non Die with honor, Oh Brien.
non Die with honor, Tosk.
non Just what did happen at that security 
non checkpoint, Chief
non The weapons' sensors must have 
non overloaded on all his various gear, 
non sir.
non "Must have"?
non Yessir.  They must have since 
non I increased their output by about 
non two hundred percent
non So in effect you assaulted him
non Our first contact with a new species.
non Yessir.
non We've got dozens of top level 
non officials back at Starfleet Command, 
non eagerly waiting to hear about our 
non encounter with the first new lifeforms 
non to come through the wormhole how 
non do you suggest I write up this report?
non Well, sir I'm not one to say.  
non But you know, these hunters weren't 
non any happier than we were about having 
non to bring Tosk home and it seems 
non in the interests of mutual 
non understanding and future relations
non Save it.
non You ignored your duty to Starfleet 
non you took off your combadge so you 
non could ignore me you even ignored 
non the Prime Directive by interfering 
non in their damned hunt.  Another stunt 
non like this and your wife won't have 
non to complain about the conditions 
non here anymore.  Do I make myself clear?
non I understand.
non I was surprised by one thing, sir.
non What's that?
non I knew I couldn't override all the 
non security seals on the station.. I 
non figured once you and the Constable 
non located us well, that it would be 
non over we'd find ourselves locked 
non behind a forcefield somewhere
non I guess that one got by us.
non Yessir.	Thank-you, sir.
non Dismissed.
