JAKE 	is nearby enjoying the scene playing itself out.					ODO				(re: barstools) 			You'll have to remove 			them.					QUARK 			Do you know how much they cost?					ODO 			No, and I can't say that I'm 			interested in learning.

He begins to get 	up, but Quark pushes him back down on the stool.					QUARK 			Nonsense.	Quark grabs Morn by the shoulders and shakes him a 	little.					QUARK 			His body weight is perfectly 			distributed across the seat.	Quark twirls Morn on the stool so he faces the dabo 	table.					QUARK 			He's also better able to enjoy the 			view of our lovely dabo girls than 			he was before. And should he 			require another drink...	Quark twirls him back to face the bar.					QUARK			... he need only spin back.					ODO 			Which points out another 			danger -- vertigo.					QUARK 			This isn't going to give anyone 			vertigo...	He gives Morn a shove and Morn begins spinning.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

The 	hard-nosed inspector vanishes and the happy lover 	appears.					KIRA 			Are you busy?					ODO				(without missing a beat) 			Not at all.					KIRA			Then can I interest you in lunch?					ODO 			Where shall we go?	They head for the door and Odo never looks back.					KIRA 			I was thinking about the Klingon 			restaurant. I haven't been there 			in ages and I have this craving 			for broiled Krada legs...	Kira and Odo EXIT. Quark sits on a barstool and looks 	after them with a thoughtful expression. Jake comes 	over to him.					JAKE 			Too bad about the barstools. I 			kinda liked them.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

And a 			distracted policeman is... ?	Jake has no idea.					QUARK 			An opportunity.	Quark smiles to himself and spins himself around on his 	stool, a new scheme already forming in his mind.									CUT TO:3    EXT.

DEFIANT - MESS HALL	SISKO is sitting at a table with a cup of coffee and 	reading a PADD. The mood in the Mess Hall is subdued, 	quiet -- everyone on the ship is tired and weary after 	a long mission. KASIDY YATES ENTERS carrying another 	PADD. She sits down with Sisko and hands him the PADD.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

Kasidy's tired too, but unlike 	Sisko, she hasn't internalized the stress and tension 	of the past few weeks. She can relax and Sisko can't.					KASIDY 			You know, when I agreed to be 			convoy liaison officer, I thought, 			"Sure. Why not? I know most of 			the freighter captains in the 			convoy -- should be a piece of 			cake." I didn't know I'd be 			making twenty log entries a day 			and filling out formal reports 			every night.					SISKO			Well, it looks like you did a 			pretty good job.	BASHIR ENTERS in the b.g., carrying two PADDS, and 	heads for the replicator.					KASIDY			If you're going to do something, 			do it right -- that's what my 			father used to say.					SISKO			Every father says that. Even I 			say that.					KASIDY 			That's why you're a good 			parent -- you know all the cliches 			by heart.	Sisko gives her a small smile, but that's all. He's 	in "captain" mode on the Defiant -- doesn't want to 	talk about family or to let down his guard in any way. 	He keeps reading her report.	Kasidy looks up as Bashir, now carrying his own coffee, 	passes by their table.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

Haven't 			seen you in days.	Bashir hands a PADD to Sisko.					BASHIR				(re: PADD) 			I've been filling out reports for 			Starfleet Medical.					KASIDY 			I knew there was a reason I didn't 			join Starfleet -- I couldn't do 			all this paperwork.					BASHIR 			Smart woman.	Bashir does not want to stay and chat. He smiles at 	her, then keeps going to an empty table on the other 	side of the room.					KASIDY 			I remember a time when you 			couldn't get him to shut up.					SISKO				(still reading) 			I think I like him better this way.					KASIDY 			That's mean.					SISKO			I'm just kidding.					KASIDY 			No, you're not.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

At his own table, Bashir reacts with resignation 	and fatigue.					SISKO				(reluctant) 			On my way.	He gets up and heads for the EXIT.									CUT TO:5    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE	O'BRIEN is sitting at a console, looking at some 	technical information as WORF looks on. Sisko ENTERS 	and goes to them.					WORF 			We've been unable to establish two-			way communication so far, but we 			have determined that the signal 			is coming from somewhere in the 			Rutharian Sector.					SISKO			Let's hear it.	O'Brien hits a control and we hear the voice of CAPTAIN 	LISA CUSAK. There's some STATIC and FRITZING on the 	com channel.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL)	docked at Deep Space Nine.46   INT. WARDROOM	Where an IRISH WAKE has just begun. There's 	traditional Irish music, some food and plenty to 	drink. Sisko, Bashir, O'Brien, Kasidy, Worf, DAX and 	SEVERAL N.D. OFFICERS from the Defiant fill the room. 	The scotch has been flowing freely and the mood is 	celebratory. At one end of the room, in front of the 	large monitor, lies a PHOTON TORPEDO which is serving 	as a casket. The torpedo has a Federation FLAG draped 	over it and is surrounded by FLOWERS.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

It's 			a way of memorializing a death and 			celebrating life at the same time.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

Talk about the deceased.					WORF			It sounds... almost Klingon.48   KASIDY	is staring out the window when Sisko comes up behind 	her and slips an arm around her.					SISKO			Hey.					KASIDY			Hey, yourself..					SISKO			When this is over... I want to			talk to you about something.			Something that's been on my mind.					KASIDY				(wary)			Okay. Is this.... about me?					SISKO			No. It's actually about me.					KASIDY				(wry)			That's a relief.					SISKO			I wanted to explain... my behavior			these last few days...	She holds up a hand to silence him.					KASIDY			Sounds good to me. But let's talk			about it over dinner.				(beat)			You can cook.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...

I am not the 			arrogant, self-absorbed, god-like 			doctor that I appear to be on 			occasion...				(beat) 			Isn't anyone going to object to 			that statement?					O'BRIEN			I will if you insist.					BASHIR			I insist.					O'BRIEN			Then I object.					BASHIR			Thank you, Miles Edward O'Brien.				(beat) 			I do have a heart. And I do care 			for all of you... even if it 			sometimes seems as though all I 			care about is my work.				(lifts a glass) 			To the woman that reminded me that 			it's necessary to say that 			sometimes... Lisa Cusak.	They all lift their glasses and toast the casket.					ALL 			To Lisa.	Bashir steps down and O'Brien steps up. He's also had 	a few.					O'BRIEN 			I never shook her hand... and I 			never saw her face... but she made 			me laugh... and she made me weep.				(beat) 			She was all by herself... and I 			was surrounded by my friends...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sound...
