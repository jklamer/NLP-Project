Kira, Dax and the crew react to this 	sudden change in the situation. Suddenly Dax's 	attention shifts to her controls.					DAX			Dukat's ship is breaking 			formation.

BARRACKS - NIGHT	This is the barracks which houses BASHIR, WORF, GARAK 	and MARTOK. Worf looks at the FEMALE ROMULAN, who 	stands at the door.					FEMALE ROMULAN			All clear.	Worf turns to Martok.					WORF			The transmitter Tain used to 			contact the station. Where is it?	Martok thinks about it, then goes over to Tain's bed. 	He and Bashir shove it aside.	Bashir reaches under the bottom of the bedframe and 	pulls out a thin, curved lever made of scavenged metal.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT ONE     8.19   CONTINUED:	He kneels down at the wall panel covered by the head of 	Tain's bed and carefully inserts the lever into a 	nearly invisible slot in the panel.	Pulling on the lever, Bashir pops open the panel. 	Martok catches it before it hits the ground and lays it 	aside. Martok then reaches up into the opening, 	struggles with some unseen catch, and pulls a second 	panel out of the hole.	Worf looks inside the hole.					BASHIR			You have to crawl through the hole 			and kind of slide up into the 			wall.					MARTOK			It took him over a year to modify 			the old life-support system into 			a transmitter.					WORF			How did he operate it?					MARTOK			He wired the message and 			transmission coordinates directly 			into the system circuitry. That 			way all he had to do was connect 			the transmitter to the power grid 			and let it run.					WORF			Could the coordinates and message 			be changed?	Garak realizes what Worf's thinking.					GARAK				(to Worf)			You're planning to contact the 			runabout.					WORF			We could activate the 			transporters, beam ourselves onto 			the ship...					BASHIR				(interrupting)			And run like hell.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT ONE     9.19   CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK			Re-encoding the transmitter won't 			be easy. We'll have to 			reconfigure the array, one circuit 			at a time.					BASHIR			Can you do it?					GARAK			Me?					BASHIR			I'm no engineer and neither is 			Mister Worf. But you, my dear 			Garak, are a man of many hidden 			talents.	All eyes turn to Garak. He knows Worf won't settle for 	anything less than a definite answer. He looks up into 	the hole, less than enthusiastic.					BASHIR			If you can't do it, no one can.					GARAK			It's nice to feel needed.	Just then, the com system activates.					COM VOICE			All prisoners assemble 			immediately.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT ONE    9A.19   CONTINUED:	(3)	Worf and Bashir exchange a look.

INTERNMENT CENTER - NIGHT	Worf, Bashir, Garak, Martok and the rest of the 	Prisoners are lined up in ranks, surrounded by 	Jem'Hadar soldiers. A Vorta approaches the assembly.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT ONE    10.20   CONTINUED:	As we will learn, this is DEYOS.					WORF			Who's that?					MARTOK			Deyos. The Vorta who runs the camp.					IKAT'IKA			No talking.					BASHIR				(sotto voce, to Garak)			Touchy, aren't they?	The Vorta stops in front of the assembled prisoners.					DEYOS			All Cardassian prisoners, step 			forward.	The prisoners exchange suspicious looks. Garak doesn't 	like the sound of this, but he knows he doesn't have 	much choice. He and the rest of the Cardassians, who 	make up about a third of the prison population, step	forward.					DEYOS			I am pleased to announce that the 			hostilities between our peoples 			have ended.	The prisoners look at each other in surprise. But 	Deyos has a final bomb to drop.					DEYOS				(smiles)			As of today, Cardassia has joined 			the Dominion. Therefore, you are 			all being sent home. 			Congratulations on your new status 			as Dominion citizens.21   NEW ANGLE	Garak glances back at the others. He looks confused 	and can't quite believe this is happening.22   CLOSE ON BASHIR, WORF, AND MARTOK	Who are also surprised. But Bashir realizes there's an 	opportunity here and makes eye contact with Garak.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT ONE      23   CLOSE ON GARAK	Who nods to Bashir, telling him with a glance that this 	is a chance to help them all and Garak won't let it 	pass by. The Jem'Hadar begin escorting the Cardassians 	away. Garak turns to leave with them, but is 	intercepted by Deyos.					DEYOS			Not you, Mister Garak.					GARAK			Excuse me?					DEYOS			You're staying.					GARAK			Perhaps there's been some sort of 			misunderstanding. The last time 			I checked, I was a Cardassian.					DEYOS			But not a very popular one, I'm 			afraid.

Not in the least. 			We should embrace the opportunity. 			The Dominion recognizes us for 			what we are... the true leaders of 			the Alpha Quadrant.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT ONE      24   CONTINUED:	As Dukat continues his speech, we...									CUT TO:25   INT.

I'm 			going to kill him.	No one leaps to Dukat's defense.					SISKO			Right now we have more immediate 			concerns. Such as who sabotaged 			our graviton emitters.					O'BRIEN			I don't know who it was, but they 			did a pretty thorough job. The 			emitters had the exact opposite 			effect from what we'd intended. 			They were supposed to collapse the 			wormhole's spatial matrix and 			close it forever. But instead 			they made the matrix even more 			stable. Not even trilithium 			explosives would destroy it now.					DAX			So the Dominion can send 			reinforcements through the 			wormhole whenever they want.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT ONE    14.28   CONTINUED:					BASHIR CHANGELING			Looks like it's time for another 			round of blood screenings. 				(off reactions)			Obviously we have a changeling 			infiltrator on the station.					DAX			What makes you think it's a 			changeling?					BASHIR CHANGELING			That's who I'd send.					KIRA			I think Julian's right. Odo tells 			me that one of the Bajoran 			maintenance engineers has been 			missing ever since the Dominion 			fleet arrived in the Alpha 			Quadrant.					BASHIR CHANGELING			If that was our changeling, he's 			either gone... or assumed a new 			identity.					SISKO			We can't afford to take chances. 			I want blood screenings and phaser 			sweeps. If he's out there, we've 			got to find him.	They all look determined, none more so than the Bashir 	Changeling, who is confident he's going to stay one 	step ahead of these unsuspecting Solids.	And as we look on the self-assured face of the Bashir 	Changeling, we...29   OMITTED									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                              DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT TWO    15.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:30   INT.

How's it coming?32   INT. CRAWLSPACE	(Intercut as necessary with the above.) This is a 	cramped, tight, narrow space, less than a foot wide. 	There's barely room for Garak to fit in with his back 	to one wall and his chest against the other. He can't 	turn around or sit down. He just has to slide one way 	or the other. The only source of fresh air is the open	panel.	The walls of the crawlspace are covered with a grid of 	cables, relay switches and couplings, which show signs 	of extensive rewiring. There's a light source that's 	been wired into one of the cables. It's probably an 	old work light that was scavenged by Tain and it's 	flickery and unreliable. Garak has pried open one of 	the relay switches, and is modifying it's interior.					GARAK,			I only wish I were still in the			Obsidian Order. This would make			a wonderful interrogation chamber.	Garak brushes against a relay and it sparks against his 	back. We can tell by his reaction that this isn't the 	first time this has happened.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT TWO    16.32   CONTINUED:					GARAK			Tight quarters, no air, bad 			lighting, random electric shocks. 			It's perfect.					BASHIR (O.S.)			I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.					GARAK			If you'd like, I'd happily trade 			places with you.					BASHIR (O.S.)			I suppose you could give me a 			crash course in Cardassian field 			engineering.

BARRACKS - NIGHT	As soon as Bashir and Martok have gotten the panels in 	position, they immediately move away and Worf puts the 	bed back in place and sits down on it, Martok sits on 	the bed next to him and they lean toward each other 	like they're talking.	Bashir starts to move away. Just as he does...    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT TWO    17.36   NEW ANGLE	First Ikat'ika ENTERS the barracks, flanked by a pair 	of Jem'Hadar guards.37   CLOSE ON BASHIR	As he reacts to the Jem'Hadar and then catches a 	glimpse of metal out of the corner of his eye.38   NEW ANGLE	Close on the metal tool the prisoners use to open the 	panels. It's in plain sight, near the foot of the bed. 	Bashir quickly places his foot over the tool.39   CLOSE ON IKAT'IKA	Who looks around the room, then focuses on Worf.					IKAT'IKA			It's time.					WORF			I'm ready.					IKAT'IKA			I've been looking forward to this.40   CLOSE ON WORF	As he gets to his feet. If the Jem'Hadar want to fight 	him, he's going to give them everything they bargained 	for and more.					WORF			So have I.	Ikat'ika leads Worf out and the other Jem'Hadar follow. 	Martok looks to the others, then trails after Worf and 	Ikat'ika.41   NEW ANGLE	As soon as the Jem'Hadar have cleared the barracks, the 	Female Romulan hurries over to door and makes sure 	they're really gone. Once she's sure the coast is 	clear, she nods to Bashir.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inferno's Light" - REV. 12/17/96 - ACT TWO    18.42   CLOSE ON BASHIR	Who moves his foot and picks up the tool. He turns to 	the male Romulan.					BASHIR				(urgent)			Give me a hand.	The male Romulan comes over and together they shove the 	bed away.
