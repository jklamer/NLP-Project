PROMENADE - NIGHT	There's not much activity on either level.  Most of the shops 	are closed.1A   ANGLE ON MORN	Asleep on the Promenade couch.  Suddenly a hand reaches in 	and shakes him awake.1B   NEW ANGLE	It's ODO, making the rounds.					ODO			All right, Morn.  You know the rules.  			No sleeping on the Promenade.  Go 			home.	Morn gets up and shuffles off to his quarters.  Odo watches 	him go, then turns and continues his rounds, passing...1C   OUTSIDE QUARK'S	Which is locked tight.  But as we push in on the bar's 	shuttered windows, we hear muffled voices and the clank of 	latinum.2    INT. QUARK'S	QUARK, ROM, and three of their Ferengi employees, including 	PEL, are seated around a table playing tongo, a popular 	Ferengi game best described as a cross between poker, mah-	jongg, and craps.  As with most games, the players' actions 	seem incomprehensible to any observer unfamiliar with its 	rules.  The Ferengi appear to be simultaneously tossing in 	and pulling out strips of latinum from a central pot, throwing 	down oval shaped playing cards and frantically rolling dice; 	all with a level of intensity and reckless pace that is closer 	to combat than recreation.       DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - 09/03/93 - TEASER       1A.	Suddenly the betting abruptly ceases and all eyes turn 	suspiciously to a sixth, previously unseen, player seated to 	the right of Quark.3    NEW ANGLE	close on DAX, the only non-Ferengi at the table, and 	apparently the equivalent of the bank for this round of play.  	She studies her hand carefully, shrewdly appraises the 	expectant faces surrounding her.4    ANGLE ON THE TABLE	A smiling Quark leans closer over to Dax.					QUARK			The risk is to you, Lieutenant.					DAX				(eyes the table)			I could probably think better without 			your hand on my thigh.     DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/09/93 - TEASER     2.4    CONTINUED:	Quark looks down at Dax's lap with feigned innocence.					QUARK			Now, how did that get there?	He removes the offending digits while leering proudly at his 	fellow Ferengis.  They leer back, Dax being a popular object 	of desire among them.					QUARK				(to Dax)			So what's it gonna be?  Confront?  			Evade?  Acquire?  Retreat?	Dax reaches her decision.  She throws down her cards and 	rolls her dice.					DAX				(a challenge)			Confront.	The players excitedly check their hands against Dax's.  As 	the truth dawns on them, they issue disgruntled groans.					DAX				(triumphant)			Yes.	She rakes in her winnings.					ROM				(depressed)			Doesn't she ever lose?					QUARK				(gazing with admiration 				at Dax)			Tell me, Lieutenant, how did you get 			to be so good at tongo?					DAX			Actually, Curzon used to play it all 			the time.					ROM			Well, that explains it.  It's Curzon 			who's beating us, not this female.					DAX			This female happens to be a better 			player than Curzon ever was.       DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - 09/03/93 - TEASER        3.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK				(flirting)			And a prettier one too.					ROM			Maybe so.  But I still prefer a 			Ferengi female.				(wistful)			One who never wears clothes, never 			talks back, and never plays tongo.					DAX				(to Quark)			Is that how you really prefer your 			women?  Naked and submissive.					QUARK			Do you find such a lifestyle 			appealing?					DAX			Don't you wish.					QUARK			Oh I do.  I really do.	Quark smiles seductively, but Dax puts back on her game face 	and turns her attention to the table.					DAX			All right everyone.  The opening 			risk is five strips of latinum.  The 			purchase is at three.  The sell at 			eight.	The players begin another round of frenzied betting.5    ANGLE ROM	shaking his head as Pel whispers to him.					ROM				(louder than intended)			No, absolutely not.  This isn't the 			proper time.6    ANGLE ON THE TABLE	as Quark elbows Rom in the ribs.     DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/09/93 - TEASER     4.6    CONTINUED:					QUARK			I'm trying to concentrate.					ROM			I'm sorry, Brother.				(re: Pel)			It's this insolent young waiter's 			fault.					PEL			My apologies, Quark.  But I really 			think you should try this.	Pel reaches past Rom and places a hand in front of Quark.7    INSERT HAND	a half dozen peas sit in the palm.					QUARK (O.S.)			What is it?8    BACK TO SCENE					PEL			A way to double your beverage profits.  			Taste it.	Quark, always on the lookout for ways to improve business, 	eats a pea and while trying to make up his mind whether he 	likes it, reaches over and takes a sip from his glass.  Pel 	points in excitement.					PEL			You see.				(to Rom)			Just as I told you.  He immediately 			reached for his drink.	Quark looks at the glass in his hand.					QUARK			So I did.	Quark eats another pea, and sure enough, he takes another 	sip of his drink.					QUARK				(impressed)			Amazing.  You don't even realize 			you're thirsty.  What are they?       DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - 09/03/93 - TEASER        5.8    CONTINUED:					PEL			Gramilian Sand Peas.  They inhibit 			secretion of the salivary glands 			while drying out the tissues of the 			tongue.  Works every time.  You 			replace your complimentary dishes of 			lokar beans with sand peas and you 			won't be able to fill your customers' 			glasses fast enough.	Sounds good to Quark.  He studies Pel.					QUARK			What's your name again?					PEL			Pel... so what do you think about my 			idea?					QUARK			I think I agree with the fifty-ninth 			Rule of Acquisition, "Free advice is 			seldom cheap."					PEL			True, but the twenty-second rule 			says, "A wise man can hear profit in 			the wind."					QUARK				(touche)			I see you know your Rules.					PEL			All two hundred and eighty-five of 			them.  And the various commentaries 			as well.				(a beat)			I don't plan on being a waiter 			forever.					ROM			Good.  Then you're fired.					QUARK			Shut up, Rom.				(to Pel)			When it comes to business, my brother 			has the weak little lobes of a female.				(a beat)			So what made you take a job here at 			the station?       DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - 09/03/93 - TEASER        6.8    CONTINUED:	(2)					PEL				(smiles at Quark)			I wanted to learn from the best.					QUARK				(nods sagely)			Which brings to mind the thirty-third 			Rule of Acquisition...					QUARK AND PEL			"It never hurts to suck up to the 			boss."	They chuckle amicably.  There's a real rapport between these 	two that Dax picks up on.  Rom can see it too and it leaves 	him seething with jealousy.  But before he can protest, we 	hear a CHIME emanate from the bar area.  Quark holds up a 	hand for silence as he listens.					DAX			What's that?					QUARK			It's Grand Nagus Zek's personal 			subspace frequency.					ROM			I wonder what he wants.9    NEW ANGLE	Quark hurries over behind the bar to the wall monitor.  He 	hits a key pad and...10   INSERT MONITOR (OPTICAL)	The crafty wizened face of GRAND NAGUS ZEK appears on screen.					ZEK			Why do you look so surprised?  I 			told you I'd be back.11   ANGLE QUARK (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) (OPTICAL)					QUARK			I've looked forward to your return, 			Nagus.       DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - 09/03/93 - TEASER        7.11   CONTINUED:					ZEK			Still the perfect little toady, eh, 			Quark?					QUARK				(modestly)			I try to be.					ZEK			Then listen carefully.  The Ferengi 			expansion into the Gamma Quadrant is 			about to begin.  I'd like you to be 			my chief negotiator.					QUARK			Me?					ZEK			That's right.  I'm offering you an 			opportunity to make more profit than 			you ever dreamed of.				(a beat)			All you have to do is earn it.12   CLOSE ON QUARK	His head already swimming in a sea of latinum.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/09/93 - ACT ONE     8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)13   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE	SISKO and KIRA are meeting with Zek.  Maihar'du, his 	everpresent Hupyrian servant, stands guard behind him.  Zek 	offers Sisko and Kira a small latinum container.					ZEK			Can I interest anyone in some Hupyrian 			beetle snuff?					SISKO			I don't think so.					ZEK			Major?					KIRA				(not a chance)			No, thank you.					ZEK			Suit yourself... more for me.	He inserts a generous helping of snuff up each nostril.  	There's a beat, and then he lets loose a thunderous, particle-	rich sneeze.	Sisko and Kira exchange disgusted glances.  Maihar'du leans 	over and offers Zek a silk handkerchief.					ZEK				(grabs it out of his 				hand)			A little late, aren't we?	He fastidiously wipes his nose.					ZEK			So, you wanted to see me, Commander?					SISKO			I understand that you're planning to 			host a business conference here at 			the station.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/10/93 - ACT ONE     9.13   CONTINUED:					ZEK			With the Dosi, a race from the Gamma 			Quadrant.  A very profitable 			opportunity for all concerned, I 			might add.					KIRA				(she can't help herself)			Profitable for the Ferengi, maybe.					ZEK			Are you implying something, Major?					KIRA				(innocent)			Me?  Not at all.  The Ferengi's 			reputation speaks for itself.					ZEK			A reputation of honesty, decency, 			and reliability.  You always know 			what to expect when you do business 			with the Ferengi.					KIRA			Which is why, if you're smart, you 			don't do business with the Ferengi...					SISKO			I think you've made your point, Major.					ZEK			As misinformed and misguided as it 			may be.  Besides, how we do business 			is none of your concern.					SISKO			Except when you conduct your business 			on this station.					KIRA			In other words, Zek, Grand Nagus or 			no Grand Nagus, if we allow you to 			hold these negotiations here, and we 			find out you're cheating these Dosi, 			I'll see to it that you never set 			foot on this station again.	Zek gives Kira his most ingratiating smile,    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/10/93 - ACT ONE    9A.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					ZEK			Did anyone ever tell you your eyes 			shine with the brilliance of Kibberian 			fire diamonds.					KIRA				(coldly)			Not that I recall.					ZEK			Well they do.	Zek cozies up to Kira and places his hand on hers.					ZEK			Tell me, Major, could Bajor use fifty 			thousand kilos of Brizeen nitrate?					KIRA			Of course we could.  With that much 			Brizeen, we could fertilize the entire 			northern peninsula.					ZEK			Well I've recently come into 			possession of fifty thousand kilos 			of Brizeen nitrate.  And to show you 			how much your cooperation means to 			me, I'll let you have the entire 			shipment.	Kira looks over at Sisko.  That's a tough offer to refuse.					SISKO			I'll still need your assurances that 			the Dosi will be treated fairly while 			they're here.					ZEK			You have my word.				(a beat)			Then it's settled.				(to Kira)			Let's see, that's fifty thousand 			kilos at... twenty-five percent off 			our usual price.       DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - 09/03/93 - ACT ONE      10.13   CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO			Twenty-five percent?  You just said 			you were giving it to them.					ZEK			You're right, Commander.  We're all 			friends here.  I'll let you have it 			at cost.					SISKO			I have a better idea.  Why not 			consider the nitrate a gift to the 			people of Bajor.					ZEK				(frowning)			A gift.  That doesn't sound very 			profitable.					SISKO			That depends.					ZEK			On what?					SISKO			On whether you want to conduct 			business here or not.	A beat, then Zek cackles in approval.					ZEK			Your negotiation skills aren't bad... 			for a human.	He gets up and pats Kira's shoulder.					ZEK			Your nitrate will be delivered 			promptly.  Anything else you need, 			please come see me personally.	And with an affectionate squeeze on her arm, he EXITS, 	followed by Maihar'du.14   HOLD ON SISKO AND KIRA	both wondering if they made the right decision.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/09/93 - ACT ONE    11.15   INT. QUARK'S QUARTERS	Zek is seated in Quark's most comfortable chair.  Quark sits 	nearby, the eager pupil learning at the foot of his master.  	Meanwhile, Maihar'du carefully and laboriously combs Zek's 	lobe hair.					ZEK			You know Quark, I've been involved 			in some profitable opportunities in 			my time.  But my lobes are telling 			me this may be the most profitable 			opportunity in Ferengi history.					QUARK			Imagine that.  And part of those 			profits will be mine.					ZEK			Profit.  Fame.  Power.  As much as 			you want.	Quark can't stand the anticipation.					QUARK			Tell me, Nagus, what exactly is this 			great opportunity.					ZEK			I can sum it up in one word... 			tulaberries.					QUARK				(not what he expected 				to hear)			Tulaberries?					ZEK			Exactly.					QUARK				(still doesn't get it)			Go on.					ZEK			They're the main ingredient in 			tulaberry wine.  Your job is to 			purchase ten thousand vats from the 			Dosi.					QUARK			We're going into the wine business?       DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - 09/03/93 - ACT ONE      12.15   CONTINUED:					ZEK				(nods)			Within a year we'll have made 			tulaberry wine the most popular drink 			in their entire sector.	Quark waits for more, but Zek waves Maihar'du away.					ZEK			That's enough.	He checks his servant's handiwork in a small vanity mirror.					ZEK			Yes, I like it.  Very distinguished.	Maihar'du bows his head in grateful acknowledge.					QUARK			Tell me, Nagus, how are tulaberries 			going to be the most profitable 			opportunity in Ferengi history?					ZEK				(annoyed)			Do I have to spell it out for you?					QUARK			If you don't mind...					ZEK			The tulaberries establish a Ferengi 			presence inside the Gamma Quadrant.  			And once we get our foot in the door, 			they'll never get it out.					QUARK				(the light dawns)			Yes, I see...					ZEK				(with a conspiratorial 				smile)			Tulaberries, Quark.

Once a deal 	is agreed upon, the participants retire to one of the small 	alcoves off the main room to finalize negotiations.	In the center of the main room, a Dosi butler dispenses 	tulaberry wine out of a huge metal vat to help grease the 	wheels of commerce.50   QUARK AND PEL	Who stand forgotten at the edge of the room.  Both of them 	have been drinking and it's starting to show.50A  NEW ANGLE	as Zyree comes up from behind and throws a welcoming arm 	around them.					ZYREE			Enjoying yourselves, little Ferengi?					QUARK				(feigned enthusiasm)			How could we not.					PEL			Tell us, Zyree, what is this place.					ZYREE			This... this is where opportunities 			are made.					QUARK			Really?  I thought it was some kind 			of party.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FOUR  38A.50A  CONTINUED:					ZYREE			Then you thought wrong.				(gestures around the 				room)			This is all about profit.  And like 			the Ferengi, the Dosi are very serious 			when it comes to profit.	Suddenly we hear a loud gunshot.51   QUARK, PEL AND ZYREE'S POV	The crowd parts to reveal a dead Dosi slumped on the floor.  	Another Dosi stands over him, placing an alien pistol back in 	his jacket.51A  BACK TO QUARK, PEL AND ZYREE					ZYREE			Very serious.	And with that she saunters away.  Quark and Pel seem to be 	the only ones reacting to this sudden outbreak of violence.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FOUR   39.51A  CONTINUED:					PEL				(spotting someone 				o.s.)			Look who finally showed up.52   THEIR POV	Inglatu has just ENTERED the tent.					QUARK (O.S.)			It's about time.53   BACK TO SCENE	Quark screws up his courage and steps out from behind the 	table.					PEL			Where are you going?					QUARK			To get serious about profit.54   NEW ANGLE	Quark matches up and taps Inglatu on the shoulder.  Inglatu 	glances over at him and sneers.					INGLATU			Oh, it's you, Ferengi.  Aren't you 			on the wrong side of the wormhole?					QUARK			It certainly feels that way.  			Fortunately, all I need is your 			thumbscan on this very lucrative 			contract and I can go home.	Quark pulls out a Ferengi PADD, but Inglatu refuses to take 	it.					INGLATU			You had your chance.	He turns away.  Quark taps him on the shoulder again.  An 	angry Inglatu whirls around.					INGLATU			I said go away.	He turns away again.  Quark taps him again.DEEP SPACE:  "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/09/93 - ACT FOUR     xx4054   CONTINUED:					QUARK			Not until we finish our discussion.	Inglatu is really getting ticked off.					INGLATU			You're starting to annoy me.	And once again he gives Quark the cold shoulder.  Quark, fed 	up with being ignored, steps forward and kicks over the wine 	keg, which lands with a LOUD CLATTER.55   NEW ANGLE	Now he has everyone's attention.					QUARK			Sorry.					INGLATU			I should have killed you back on 			that station.					QUARK			But you didn't.  Because deep down 			inside you recognize a good 			opportunity when you see one.				(offers the PADD)			Just put your thumbscan here.	A long beat as Inglatu glares at Quark.  Finally...					INGLATU			All right.  You can have ten thousand 			vats.	Quark pulls back the PADD.					QUARK			A hundred thousand.					INGLATU			I told you before, that's impossible.					QUARK			One hundred thousand and I'm not 			leaving until I get it.	Inglatu has had enough.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FOUR   41.55   CONTINUED:					INGLATU			Fine.  Then stay.	And he storms out of the tent.56   OMITTED57   HOLD ON QUARK	who exchanges a dismayed look with Pel.58   INT. TENT SLEEPING QUARTERS	Quark and Pel ENTER and survey the tiny room which is entirely 	taken up by a bed and small nightstand.  The thought of 	sleeping next to Quark in such a confined space has Pel a 	little apprehensive.					PEL			Wouldn't we be more comfortable 			sleeping on the ship?					QUARK			No, I want to be right here in case 			Inglatu changes his mind.				(a beat)			Don't worry.  I don't snore.	He sits down to test the bed.					PEL			Wait.					QUARK			What is it?					PEL				(thinking fast)			The mattress.					QUARK			What about it?					PEL			It looks lumpy.	Quark tries it out.					QUARK			Actually, it's quite comfortable.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FOUR  41A.58   CONTINUED:					PEL			I can't sleep on a lumpy mattress.					QUARK			Well, you're in luck.  There's not a 			lump to be found.	Quark moves over to give her room.					QUARK			Try it for yourself.  Which side to 			you want?	Quark starts to remove his jacket.					PEL			What are you doing?					QUARK			Getting undressed.  What's it look 			like?					PEL			You're not going to sleep, are you?					QUARK			Why not?  I'm tired.					PEL			But shouldn't we be discussing 			strategy?					QUARK			There's nothing to discuss.					PEL			But you know what the hundred and 			third Rule of Acquisition says...					QUARK				(tries to remember)			Not offhand.					PEL				(quoting)			"Sleep can interfere with...

She spots a carafe of wine 	and two glasses sitting on the nightstand.					PEL			First, a toast.					QUARK			To what?	Pel pours them each a glass.  She offers one to Quark who 	has to stand to take it.					PEL			To profit, of course.					QUARK			Of course.	They drink.  They're only inches apart, they're eyes locked 	on each other's gaze.					QUARK			Is it warm in here?					PEL			It must be the wine.					QUARK				(nervously staring 				into her eyes)			I hope so.					PEL			I was impressed with the way you 			handled Inglatu.					QUARK			I was good, wasn't I.				(a beat)			Now let's go to bed.	She pours them each another glass.  This time neither one of 	them waits for a toast.  They both gulp down the wine, hoping 	to steady their nerves.					PEL			The look on his face when you knocked 			over that barrel.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FOUR   43.58   CONTINUED:	(4)					QUARK			That was risky.					PEL				(quoting)			"The riskier the road, the greater 			the profit."					QUARK			The sixty-second Rule.					PEL			That's right.					QUARK				(looking to fill the 				silence)			You really know your Rules.					PEL				(swept away by the 				moment)			And you have a very nice smile.					QUARK				(without thinking)			I do?	Suddenly, Pel lunges forward and kisses Quark on the lips 	who reels back in shock.					PEL			Quark, I have something to tell you...59   NEW ANGLE	But before Pel can explain herself, the tent flap opens and 	Zyree ENTERS, startling them both.					ZYREE			I'm not interrupting anything, am I?					QUARK			No.  Definitely not.					ZYREE			You're sure?	Quark takes her by the arm to lead her into the room.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FOUR  43A.59   CONTINUED:					QUARK			Positive.	But Zyree still isn't convinced.					ZYREE			I'll come back tomorrow.	She turns and leaves.  Quark and Pel exchange looks.  Quark 	doesn't want to hear anything Pel has to say.					QUARK				(calling after Zyree)			Wait.	He follows her out.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FOUR   44.59   CONTINUED:	(2)	Pel uses the opportunity to pour herself another cup of 	tulaberry wine which she gulps down just as Quark RE-ENTERS 	with Zyree.					QUARK				(to Zyree)			Don't be ridiculous, we can't wait 			to hear what you have to say.  			Besides, we could use the company.				(to Pel)			Isn't that right.					PEL			Absolutely.					ZYREE			All right then, let me give you some 			advice... Inglatu will never sell 			you a hundred thousand vats of 			tulaberry wine.  Not because he 			doesn't want to, but because he can't.	Quark is eager to discuss something other than what just 	happened with Pel.					QUARK			If he can't, then who can?  You?					ZYREE			I wish I could, but there aren't 			that many vats on the entire planet.					QUARK				(to Pel, gloomy)			Then we're finished.					ZYREE			Not necessarily.				(off Quark's reaction)			If you really want a hundred thousand 			vats of tulaberry wine, I can put 			you in touch with the right people.  			For a price, of course.					QUARK			Of course.				(an encouraging smile)			I always said you were my favorite 			Dosi.				(confidentially)			Now... who do we have to see?    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FOUR  44A.59   CONTINUED:	(3)					ZYREE				(conspiratorial)			The Karemma.					PEL			Who are the Karemma?					ZYREE			They're an important power in the 			Dominion.					QUARK			The Dominion?  What's that?					ZYREE			Let's just say that if you want to 			do business in the Gamma Quadrant... 			you have to do business with the 			Dominion.60   HOLD ON QUARK AND PEL	pondering this latest mystery.61   EXT.

Quark, still in denial about what 	happened in that Dosi bedroom, is pontificating to a brooding 	Pel.					QUARK			The biggest opportunity in Ferengi 			history, that's what Zek called it.  			But he didn't mean tulaberries.  He 			meant the Dominion.  That's why he 			sabotaged the negotiations.  He never 			wanted to do business with the Dosi.  			He just wanted to use them to get to 			someone more important in the 			Dominion.    DEEP SPACE: "Rules of Acquisition" - REV. 09/09/93 - ACT FOUR   45.61A  CONTINUED:					PEL				(snapping out of it)			Quark, we need to talk.					QUARK			We are talking.					PEL			Don't you want to know why I kissed 			you?					QUARK			You didn't kiss me.					PEL			Yes, I did.					QUARK			No, you didn't.  And I don't want to 			discuss it anymore.				(a beat)			Now, let's just concentrate on the 			Dominion.				(without waiting for 				an answer)			I only wish Zyree would have told us 			more.	A defeated Pel tries to get into the spirit of things.					PEL			It could be some kind of planetary 			alliance; or trading consortium...					QUARK			Whatever it is, it's important.
