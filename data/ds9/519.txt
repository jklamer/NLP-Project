INFIRMARY	GENERAL MARTOK is sitting on the examining table	cradling his left arm and shoulder, which are both 	covered in blood from a nasty-looking wound at the 	shoulder joint. BASHIR and an N.D. Nurse are tending 	to the wound with medical instruments. Martok and 	Bashir have a bond between them that was forged in a 	Dominion prison camp, and while there is a bite in 	their words, they also genuinely respect and even like 	each other.					BASHIR			Another three centimeters to the 			right and you would've severed the 			brachial artery.				(to Nurse) 			Auto-suture.				(she hands him the 				device) 			And if that had happened, you 			would've bled to death right there 			in the holosuite.					MARTOK 			The human fascination with "what 			might have been" is tiresome, 			doctor. The artery was not 			severed and I am not dead.					BASHIR 			Oh. Well. Forgive me for boring 			you. Let me get right to the 			point.	Bashir straightens the damaged arm, causing Martok to 	wince slightly as he continues to work on it.					BASHIR				(continuing) 			You're acting like a fool.	Martok's temper flares, but he restrains himself.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - TEASER       2.1    CONTINUED:					MARTOK 			Your... observation is noted. But 			spending two years in a Dominion 			prison camp has dulled my 			reflexes. This...				(his shoulder)			... only proves that I need 			further training.					BASHIR 			Turning off the holosuite safety 			protocols during a battle 			simulation is a dubious idea 			at best. For a man with only one eye 			it's idiotic. Now, if you'd like 			to consider an ocular 			replacement...					MARTOK 			I do not want an artificial eye.					BASHIR			Then accept the fact you have a 			disability and stop acting like --					MARTOK				(he means it) 			There are limits to how far I will 			indulge you.	Bashir knows when to back off, and he concentrates on 	finishing the repair job.					COM VOICE 			General Martok, there is a 			priority message for you from the 			Klingon High Council.	Martok looks to Bashir, who begins putting his 	instruments away.					BASHIR 			You're done here.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - TEASER       3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					MARTOK				(to com) 			Route the message to my quarters.					COM VOICE			Acknowledged.	Martok gets off the table, and flexes his arm gingerly 	as he heads for the door. He pauses for a moment.					MARTOK 			Doctor... thank you.					BASHIR 			If you really want to thank me... 			don't walk in here dripping blood 			anymore.				(beat)			It takes days to get it out of the 			carpet.	Martok looks down at the floor, then realizes that 	Bashir is pulling his leg. Martok allows just the hint 	of a smile to play on his lips, and then EXITS.									CUT TO:2    EXT. SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL)	Docked at the station.3    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE	WORF is lying on his back underneath the Tactical 	console, with optical cabling and equipment strewn 	about. NOG is standing next to him, working the 	console and watching the readouts which are flickering 	and changing as Worf works.					WORF 			Check it now.					NOG				(works, then tired) 			Still no increase in phaser relay 			efficiency, sir. The through-put 			reading is steady at one four 			eight point seven.					WORF 			Have you initialized the interface 			program?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - TEASER       4.3    CONTINUED:	Nog's answer has a bit of exasperation in it -- we get	the feeling that he's been at this a while and that	Worf's been riding him.					NOG 			Yes, and then I charged the pre-			fire chamber and recalibrated the 			emitter stage. This thing just 			doesn't work!	Worf pulls his head out from under the console and 	gives him a baleful look.					NOG				(chastened) 			Sir.	Worf decides to let that slide and he puts his head 	back into the tangle of circuitry.					WORF 			Very well. We will start over. 			Go to the Engine Room and download 			the operating system into the 			computer core one file at a time.	Nog bares his teeth in frustration and forms a circle 	with his hands as he imagines putting his fingers 	around Worf's throat and choking him. He quickly 	recovers and gives the only acceptable reply.					NOG 			Aye, sir.	He turns around to leave and then walks right into 	Martok's chest. Nog almost jumps out of his skin in 	surprise as the towering Klingon stares down at him. 	How long has he been standing there?					NOG				(gulps) 			Good evening, general.					MARTOK 			Cadet.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - TEASER       5.3    CONTINUED:	(2)	Worf comes out from under the console to greet Martok 	and as he does so, Nog becomes trapped between Martok, 	Worf and the captain's chair. Worf and Martok begin 	talking directly over Nog's head and seem to forget 	about him for the moment.					WORF 			General. I did not expect you 			until twenty-two hundred hours.					MARTOK 			I must cancel our appointment. I 			have received new orders from the 			High Council -- a mission of some 			importance... I must prepare.					WORF 			Of course. May glory and honor 			follow you on your journey.	Martok nods in acknowledgement and this gives Nog a 	chance to cut in.					NOG 			Excuse me, sirs?	Martok and Worf both look down, remembering Nog for the 	first time.					NOG				(continuing)			If I could just... slip by... ?	They realize he's trapped and Martok steps aside with 	a grunt. Nog makes a quick EXIT. Martok takes a 	moment to gather his thoughts and as he does, he flexes 	his left shoulder a bit.					WORF 			How is your shoulder?					MARTOK 			Doctor Bashir has made the 			necessary repairs -- and I told 			him it was a holosuite accident. 			He would not understand the need 			to draw blood in a warrior's 			training exercise.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - TEASER       6.3    CONTINUED:	(3)					WORF 			Few humans would. However, I do 			apologize again for the 			inconvenience. I did not intend 			to cause so much damage.					MARTOK 			I am the one who did not parry the 			blow in time. A simple and 			foolish mistake -- one that I 			would not have made two years ago.					WORF 			You have made great progress. 			Your fighting skills will return 			in time.					MARTOK			Yes...	Martok looks down at his shoulder, still bothered by the 	mistake he made. Worf decides to change the subject.					WORF 			Can you discuss your mission?					MARTOK 			Three days ago, the battle cruiser 			B'Moth began a patrol near the 			Cardassian border. They have not 			been heard from since and have 			been reported as missing.					WORF 			It is possible she was destroyed 			by the Dominion. The Jem'Hadar 			attacked a Federation starship 			near the border less than a week 			ago.					MARTOK 			That is our assumption as well, 			but we must be certain. So I am 			being given command of a Bird of 			Prey -- the Rotarran -- to conduct 			a search for the B'Moth. 				(beat) 			This will be the first time I have 			led troops in the field since 			my... confinement by the 			Dominion.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - TEASER       7.3    CONTINUED:	(4)					WORF 			It must be... an exciting 			prospect.					MARTOK 			I tell you, Worf -- without shame -- 			that there were days in that 			prison camp... when the thought 			that I would never again set foot 			on a Klingon vessel... made me 			weep like an old woman.					WORF			I envy you the days ahead. It 			will be a glorious adventure.	Martok looks at him with a smile.					MARTOK 			An adventure that we could share,			my friend. I need someone who I 			can trust at my side. Someone 			whose loyalty I can count on.				(beat, then formally) 			Worf, son of Mogh... I ask you to			join me on this mission as my 			friend... and as my first 			officer.	OFF Worf's expression as he takes in this surprising 	request.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Worf is meeting with SISKO.					SISKO			I told the General I'm inclined to 			grant his request for your 			services, commander. I can 			certainly understand why he'd want 			you along -- you're a fine 			officer. But I'm not sure why you 			want to go on this mission.					WORF			It is... a great honor to be asked 			to serve under General Martok. 				(beat) 			And... he saved my life in the 			Dominion prison camp.					SISKO			Oh? You didn't put that in your 			mission report.					WORF			It was a personal matter -- not 			something that belongs in an 			official report.	Worf pauses, trying to put this into terms that a human 	can understand.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - ACT ONE       9.5    CONTINUED:					WORF				(continuing) 			You... know that I was forced to			fight the Jem'Hadar guards in the 			camp...				(off his nod) 			Each day they would call me to the 			ring and each day I would fight. 			But then, there came a day when 			I... wavered.					SISKO			You mean you didn't want to go 			back into the ring?					WORF			No. I mean that I considered 			letting them kill me. It seemed 			like the only way out.				(beat) 			Just before I went into the ring, 			Martok turned to wish me 			success... and then he saw what 			I was planning -- saw it in my 			eyes. It was a moment of 			Tova'dok.					SISKO			Of what?					WORF 			There is no human word for it. It 			is a moment of... clarity between 			two warriors on the field of 			battle. Much is said without the 			need for words. In that moment, 			Martok knew what was in my mind.				(beat) 			Once I realized that he saw my 			intention to give up, I could no 			longer go through with it. I went 			back into the ring... and fought 			once more.	A quiet beat as Sisko studies the face of this man he 	knows so well and yet doesn't know at all. Worf 	immediately feels uncomfortable.					WORF 			Perhaps it is something that a 			human cannot understand...	Sisko picks up a PADD and makes a few entries.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - ACT ONE      10.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 			As of this moment you will be 			relieved of all Starfleet 			obligations and will be placed on 			detached service to the Imperial 			Klingon Defense Forces.	Sisko stands and hands over the PADD to Worf.					WORF 			Thank you, sir.	He turns to go.					SISKO			Mister Worf...				(Worf stops) 			Q'apla!					WORF				(with pride) 			Q'apla!	Worf EXITS, leaving Sisko a moment to look down at his 	own reflection in the computer monitor and ponder the 	things that may pass between men in just a look.									CUT TO:6    EXT.

QUARK'S	DAX, O'BRIEN and Bashir are sitting at one of the 	tables on the First Level as KIRA walks up to them 	carrying a PADD. She sits down and puts the PADD on 	the table. During the following conversation, Dax 	seems lost in thought and distracted by something.					KIRA				(re: PADD) 			The revised duty roster -- read it 			and weep.	O'Brien picks it up first and groans.					O'BRIEN 			Small arms recalibration? You 			don't mean all the arms on the 			station?					KIRA			'Fraid so. And I need an 			experienced combat officer to do 			it. Worf has already set up the 			parameters... all you have to do is 			make sure it gets done.	O'Brien still looks unhappy as Bashir looks over the 	list.					BASHIR 			I'm the new Intelligence officer?					KIRA			It has to be a Starfleet officer 			with a level four security 			clearance. That means either you 			or Dax, and I need Dax to take 			over as Fleet Liaison Officer.	Bashir groans.					O'BRIEN 			It beats retuning phaser rifles.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - ACT ONE      12.7    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Well, I certainly hope Worf enjoys 			himself while we're stuck here 			taking over his duties.					DAX			Julian, have you ever been on a 			Klingon ship? If you think the 			Defiant is cramped and 			uncomfortable, try spending a week 			on a bird of prey. Worf isn't 			exactly taking a luxury cruise.					O'BRIEN 			I've heard that serving on a 			Klingon ship is like being with a 			gang of ancient sea pirates. You 			advance in rank by killing the 			people above you, so everywhere 			you turn you're surrounded by 			potential assassins.					KIRA			That's crazy. How can a ship 			function like that?					DAX 			It's not quite that chaotic. The 			social and military hierarchy on 			a Klingon vessel is very strictly 			enforced. A subordinate can only 			challenge his direct superior and 			only under certain conditions.					BASHIR			What sort of "conditions?"					DAX 			Dereliction of duty, dishonorable 			conduct, cowardice...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - ACT ONE      13.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN			Cowardice? A Klingon?					DAX			It's been known to happen. The 			Klingons are as diverse a people 			as any other. Some of them are 			strong, and some of them are weak.	This seems to trouble her for some reason and she loses 	herself for a moment in thought again. But before 	anyone can follow up, Bashir sees something o.s.					BASHIR 			Well, I'd say that those two 			definitely fall into the "strong" 			category.	Everyone looks up to see...8    TWO KLINGONS	ENTER the bar. Their names are KORNAN and LESKIT, and	they are just about the most disreputable looking 	Klingons we've ever seen. Kornan has short-cropped 	hair, a non-Klingon alien disruptor in a holster at his 	side, and wears a pair of alien boots. He's removed 	the normal furry sleeves from his uniform, revealing a 	pair of muscular arms criss-crossed with dozens of 	scars.	Leskit's hair is long, but almost entirely gray, even 	though he seems to be no more than thirty-five. His 	uniform is old and ragged, bearing more patches than 	fabric, and his face is pocked and marked as if riddled 	with shrapnel in some long-ago battle. Leskit is also 	wearing a necklace of what looks like short BONES 	around his neck.	The one characteristic that both men share is their 	attitude. The loud, boisterous Viking elan we 	associate with Klingons is missing in these two and has 	been replaced with the dangerously quiet insolence of 	a junkyard dog. They walk through the room without a 	word and quietly take a table, where a Waiter moves to 	take a drink order.	ODO follows them into the bar, and comes to a stop near 	the table with Dax and the others, never taking his eye 	off the Klingons.					KIRA			Trouble?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - ACT ONE      14.8    CONTINUED:					ODO			Not yet.					KIRA			I can see why they caught your 			attention.					O'BRIEN 			They're off Martok's new ship?					ODO 				(nods) 			It just docked.	Everyone watches the Klingons for a moment, but Kornan 	and Leskit are completely uninterested in what's going 	on around them. They don't appear to be looking for 	trouble.					O'BRIEN 			They seem quiet enough.					ODO 			For the moment, maybe. But do you 			see the necklace the one on the 			left is wearing?					BASHIR 				(so?) 			Yes.					ODO 			Those are neckbones -- Cardassian 			neckbones.	Everyone looks at the two visitors with a bit of shock. 	PUSH IN on Dax, who takes this news grimly, and seems 	to be coming to some kind of a decision...									CUT TO:9    INT. CORRIDOR/AIRLOCK	Worf and Dax are heading down the Corridor toward an 	airlock. Worf is now wearing a Klingon uniform which 	has been altered with different sleeves and a simpler 	neckpiece. His hair is still in its customary 	ponytail, but he is not wearing his sash. Dax is in 	her normal uniform.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - ACT ONE      15.9    CONTINUED:					DAX 			Decided not to wear the sash after 			all?					WORF			Officially, there is no House of 			Mogh in the Empire, so I saw 			little point in wearing its emblem 			on a Klingon ship.					DAX			How do you think the crew's going 			to feel about serving under a man 			without a House?					WORF			How they feel is unimportant. All 			I require is their obedience.	They pause outside the airlock.					DAX 			Spoken like an uncaring, hard-			nosed, autocrat -- the 			quintessential first officer.	She smiles at him and then there's an awkward beat.					WORF 			I... do not wish to have a lengthy 			good-bye.					DAX			I wasn't planning on having one.					WORF 			Good.	He looks at her, still expecting a farewell... but she 	simply looks at him. He decides not to linger, and 	gives her a short nod good-bye before turning to enter 	the airlock. Dax goes with him and then Worf stops.					WORF 			Jadzia.					DAX			Yes.					WORF 			I think it would be better to part 			company here on the station.	Dax's response is just as innocent as can be.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

I've already cleared it 			with Martok and Benjamin. I'm 			your new Science Officer.	She smiles at him, enjoying his discomfort.					WORF			Why didn't you tell me?					DAX			It was more fun this way.				(getting more serious) 			And after getting a good look at 			a couple members of the Rotarran's 			crew... I don't think we're going 			to be having a lot of fun on this 			mission.	Worf thinks about the implications of that as Dax turns 	and EXITS to the airlock.									CUT TO:10   EXT.

KLINGON BRIDGE 	Dax is sitting at a science console (and now armed with	a phaser), going over some readings when she feels like 	she's being watched.

KLINGON MESS HALL	The Mess Hall contains a single long table with chairs	on either side, encouraging the crew to sit and eat 	together. The bulkheads are covered with Klingon 	tapestries and artwork portraying the glorious history 	of the Empire -- but everything has an unkempt and 	dingy look to it (even for a Klingon ship). Bowls of 	(to us) unappetizing food are in the middle of the 	table, with utensils and plates present but clearly 	optional.	At the moment, Kornan, Leskit, Tavana, a young Klingon 	male named ORTAKIN and two N.D.s are grouped around 	one end of the table, leaving more than half of the 	seating area empty. Tavana is just sitting down and 	the rest of them are eating with the sullen lack of 	enthusiasm that's a hallmark of this ship. Dax ENTERS 	and while everyone glances up at her, only Tavana nods 	a greeting. The rest return to their food.	Dax takes only a moment to size up the situation and 	then she moves confidently to Ortakin, grabs him by the 	hair and YANKS him back off the chair where he crashes 	to the floor. Ortakin lets out a yell of anger, tries 	to roll to his feet, but Dax is faster and has her knee 	firmly planted on his throat, pinning him to the deck.					DAX				(to Ortakin) 			Maybe you didn't read the crew 			roster, but my name is Dax and I'm			the new science officer on this 			garbage scow. And you were in my 			seat.	Ortakin struggles, but she's got him and the only thing 	he can do is let out a strangled grunt of frustration.					DAX				(continuing) 			I'm glad we understand each other. 			Now get down to the other end 			where you belong.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

Then I'm glad I brought			three barrels aboard just before 			we left Deep Space Nine.	Everyone at the table stops at the same moment and 	slowly turn to look at Dax.

Kornan, Leskit, 	Ortakin and Tavana are all drinking from tankards of 	bloodwine, and more N.D.s have joined them for the 	occasion. It's still not a full-blown party like it 	would be on most Klingon ships, but the mood is 	definitely lighter than before. Tavana is telling Dax 	about their previous missions.					TAVANA 			... the Cardassians were trapped 			between us and the asteroid field. 			It was perfect -- their power was 			failing, they had no other ships 			nearby and our weapons were fully 			charged.					KORNAN 				(bitter) 			And we were still denied the 			victory.	Kornan takes another long pull of his bloodwine. His 	bitterness only seems to increase as they talk.					TAVANA 			Three Jem'Hadar ships appeared out 			of the asteroid field.					DAX			Three to one are long odds. I'd 			say you did well just getting away 			with your ship in one piece.	In contrast with Kornan, the wine seems to make Leskit 	more vocal and sardonic -- he seems to enjoy the 	continual humiliation of his ship and crew.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

Hold off fate 			for another day if you can... but 			this ship and all the souls within 			its hull... are cursed.	Kornan's words spread a chill across the room and Dax 	can see that he is far from the only one here to 	believe this. She tries to dismiss this idea.					DAX				(mocking) 			What are you saying -- someone 			cast a spell on you?					KORNAN 			Some one, some thing, who knows 			what guides the fury of the 			universe?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

Dax begins thinking rapidly...37   CLOSE ON DAX'S HANDS - INSERT	As Dax taps in a few quick commands into the console.38   LESKIT	now stands up and faces Worf with Kornan. The two men 	move a few feet away from each other, and their hands 	dangle near their weapons.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

Klingons on the 	Bridge take a few steps to stand with Kornan/Leskit. 	Everyone is ready to pull a weapon and waiting for a 	signal, but the center of the drama is between Worf and 	the two men at the Helm.					KORNAN				(to Worf) 			Martok must die.					WORF				(cool) 			That is not your decision.					LESKIT 			He's a coward. While he commands, 			he dishonors us all.					WORF				(with contempt) 			I shed no tears for your 			"dishonor" Leskit.					LESKIT 			Today... would be a bad day to 			die, Son of Mogh. Take your Trill 			and go.					WORF			Unlikely.					LESKIT 			I was hoping you would say 			something like that.	Leskit's smile gets bigger and the confrontation is 	about to reach the flash point when suddenly the doors 	OPEN and Ortakin ENTERS (he was summoned by Dax) 	carrying a disruptor rifle and backed by two more N.D.s 	also armed with rifles. They move to stand with Tavana. 	Kornan and Leskit exchange a look, hesitating 	to make their move now that the odds are more even. 	Worf takes the opportunity to change the situation and 	he stands and gives a fateful order.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

But before the crew can swing 	into action, Martok ENTERS from his Ready Room.					MARTOK			Who gave the order to-- 				(stops short) 			What's going on?	Worf now turns away from Leskit and Kornan and faces 	Martok, shifting the momentum away from the stillborn 	mutiny as he confronts the General.					WORF			As first officer, I say... you are 			unfit to serve as captain.					MARTOK 				(shocked) 			You... what?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

He pulls his knife and 	readies himself for the fight. Martok glances around 	the Bridge at the faces of his crew -- sees no way out, 	and then pulls his own knife.40   THE FIGHT 	begins with the two men circling each other warily 	around the captain's chair... then Worf LUNGES at 	Martok. The General moves out of the way and HITS Worf 	as he passes, but Worf barely feels the blow...41   THE KLINGONS 	watch with little expression at first, maintaining an 	eerie calm as the life-and-death struggle plays out 	only a few short feet away. Only Dax seems to have any 	kind of emotional stake in what's happening.	But as the fight goes on, we should see that the 	Klingons can't help but get emotionally involved in the 	fight... their warrior instincts and hormones rising to 	the fore despite themselves...42   THE FIGHT	Worf is clearly the better combatant -- Martok is on 	the defensive and only barely able to keep Worf 	from landing the killing stroke by clever use of the chairs 	and consoles of the Bridge.	Worf SLASHES Martok's free arm, drawing first blood and 	getting a YELL in response from the gathered crowd.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers... " - REV. 03/03/97 - ACT FIVE     53.43   MARTOK	pauses for a moment, surprised by the painful blow.44   WORF	could press his advantage, but instead he chooses to 	turn to the crowd and raise his knife in victory and 	let out his own YELL -- this only serves to whip the 	crowd up further.					CROWD 			Q'apla! Kill him! First blood! 			Bosh to-KA achee! Mok-KRA! Kill 			him! First Blood! etc.45   MARTOK	looks from his wounded arm, to the crowd and then back 	to Worf. His eyes narrow and he begins to feel the 	first stirrings of rage deep within. Without warning, 	he makes a quick, slashing attack at Worf, who has to 	move quickly to fend it off.46   THE CROWD	is definitely into the fight now. Their bloodlust is 	beginning to rise and all thoughts of the mutiny have 	been pushed aside as they watch the mortal combat take 	place in front of them.					CROWD 			Take him, Worf! The one-eyed 			giant will fall! Go for his blind 			side! Cho-ee-GAK! Kill him! 			Kill him! Kill him! etc.47   THE FIGHT	Martok is now giving a better account of himself, but 	Worf is still able to knock the older man back on his 	heels and stay out of harm's way. Worf ducks under an 	ill-timed slash and almost guts the General right 	there, but Martok just barely gets his free hand and 	the two men grapple with each other for a moment -- 	Martok's back against the helm console, and Worf's face 	only a few inches away from his.48   WORF & MARTOK	look into each other's eyes for a moment that seems 	like an eternity.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

The SOUND 	of the crowd FADES AWAY and for this instant, it seems 	as though no one else is here.	Worf searches in Martok's face for something... and 	finally finds it. It is a moment of Tova'dok -- Worf 	knows what's in Martok's heart and now Worf knows what 	he must do...49   NEW ANGLE 	As we return to real time. Worf breaks the hold and 	moves back to circle for another chance. Martok is now 	the aggressor, charging and slashing at Worf with a 	ferocity only hinted at earlier.50   THE CROWD 	is a little surprised by Martok's new offensive 	posture, but their bloodlust is in full cry and it 	doesn't really matter to them who wins and who loses at 	this point -- their screams are incoherent, almost 	insane as they give themselves over to the madness of 	combat.51   THE FIGHT 	Martok presses the fight... Worf retreats... then 	finally Worf makes a fatal mistake and Martok KNOCKS 	the knife out of Worf's hand and sends it flying across 	the Bridge. Martok snarls and PLUNGES the knife deep	into Worf's side and then pulls it out again -- a 	grave, but not fatal wound -- and Worf goes down onto 	the deck.	The crowd falls silent for a shocked moment as Worf 	hits the deck... Martok turns to them, breathing 	heavy... and then Kornan begins the chant:					KORNAN			Martok... Martok...

Even from this vantage, it's 	clear that they are a changed crew -- telling tales of 	their rescue of the B'Moth, and laughing as they spar 	with one another.	Martok comes over and sits down with Worf.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Soldiers...

Martok decides to start with something 	neutral.					MARTOK 			The High Council has issued a 			commendation to the entire crew of 			the Rotarran. It would seem you 			were right. They view the 			destruction of a Jem'Hadar ship 			and the rescue of thirty-five 			warriors as ample justification 			for crossing the Cardassian 			border.	Worf nods. After a long beat, Martok decides to move 	to something more personal.					MARTOK 			Your actions on the Rotarran... at 			the time I thought they were... 			disloyal. But I have come to 			realize that your intention was to 			remind me of my duty as a 			soldier of the Empire... and as a warrior. 			For that I am grateful.					WORF			You did the same for me once.					MARTOK				(remembering)			Yes...	A quiet beat.					MARTOK 			On the bridge... during the fight, 			when you dropped your guard.

There's a beat 	as Worf takes a sip of his drink. Martok notes the 	sash Worf is wearing.					MARTOK 			I see you still wear the crest of 			the House of Mogh.					WORF 			Yes. Jadzia calls it a... 			sentimental gesture.	Martok nods, then takes the family crest off his own 	arm sleeve and holds it out to Worf.					MARTOK 			Perhaps you would consider 			replacing sentiment with... the 			symbol of a new beginning.	He holds out the crest of his family and Worf looks at 	it with surprise for a moment.					MARTOK				(continuing) 			The House of Martok would be 			honored to welcome the Son of Mogh 			into our family... as a warrior... 			and a brother.	He holds Worf's eyes for a long beat.
