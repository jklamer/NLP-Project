SPACE - THE HONSHU (OPTICAL)	A Federation starship at warp.					SISKO (V.O.) 			Captain's Log: Stardate 51408.6. 			I've been aboard the Honshu for 			two days now and I still haven't 			spoken to him, although the 			doctors have assured me that he's 			made a full recovery.2    INT. HONSHU - CORRIDOR	SISKO is walking down one of the Corridors.					SISKO (V.O.) 				(continuing) 			Maybe that's what I'm afraid of. 			Maybe I prefer to think of him as 			a crazy man... a broken man. He'd 			be less dangerous that way.	Sisko pauses outside a door marked "BRIG."					SISKO (V.O.) 				(continuing) 			As terrible as it sounds, there's 			a part of me that wishes he were 			dead. But that's a thought 			unworthy of a Starfleet officer.	Sisko takes a deep breath, then goes through the door 	to...3    INT. HONSHU - BRIG - CONTINUOUS	As Sisko ENTERS. There's an N.D. Security Guard at the 	small desk outside the holding cell who nods to Sisko, 	then returns to his work. Sisko moves to the cell and 	looks inside.     STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - TEASER     2.3    CONTINUED:					SISKO (V.O.)				(continuing) 			He lost an empire, he lost his 			daughter, and he nearly lost his 			mind. Whatever his crimes... 			isn't that enough punishment for 			one lifetime?4    NEW ANGLE	Revealing GUL DUKAT in the cell. He's sitting on the 	deck, deep in meditation. His hair is longer and a 	little more unkempt than we've seen it before. There's 	a brief moment before Dukat seems to notice that 	there's someone watching him. He finally looks up and 	smiles.					DUKAT 			I heard you were aboard. I 			wondered if you'd make an 			appearance.					SISKO			How are you?					DUKAT 			Better.	Dukat gets off the floor and sits on the bunk. He's 	calm, rational, a little subdued. There's also a new 	aspect to Dukat's personality we're not used to 	seeing -- humility. Dukat seems like a great man 	brought low, but trying to retain whatever shreds of 	dignity he has left. Despite this, Sisko is still a 	little guarded.					DUKAT				(continuing) 			The doctors tell me I've made a 			remarkable recovery.					SISKO 			They told me the same thing.					DUKAT 			Good. I'd hate to think they were 			patronizing me.				(beat) 			So... I'm a war criminal.     STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - TEASER     3.4    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			In the Federation, you're innocent 			until proven guilty.					DUKAT 			So I'm told. 				(beat) 			Do you believe I'm guilty, 			Benjamin?	An awkward beat.					SISKO			I haven't seen all the charges.					DUKAT 			It's not like you to equivocate.					SISKO			I'm trying to be fair. You won't be 			tried until the war's over. This 			appearance before the Special Jury 			is... just a formality.					DUKAT 			And you'll be testifying for the 			prosecution.					SISKO			I'll tell them what I know.	Beat.					DUKAT			Would you care to elaborate?					SISKO 			Not really.					DUKAT 			I see.	He lapses into silence.					SISKO			I never got the chance to tell 			you... how sorry I am about Ziyal.	Dukat glances up at him and gives him a ironic smile.     STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - TEASER     4.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					DUKAT 			Do I detect the fine hand of 			Doctor Cox at work once again?					SISKO				(puzzled) 			I told him I wanted to offer my 			condolences.					DUKAT 			I'm sorry. The good doctor 			encourages me to talk about... 			Ziyal whenever possible since it 			was her... death that brought on 			my... momentary instability. I 			shouldn't be so suspicious.					SISKO			It's all right.	There doesn't seem to be much else to say. Sisko gets 	ready to go.					SISKO				(continuing) 			Well. We should be arriving at 			Starbase Six-Two-One by noon 			tomorrow.				(beat) 			I'll see you at the arraignment.	He turns to go.					DUKAT 			Benjamin.	Sisko stops. Dukat is struggling here... trying to say 	things that he probably never would have verbalized if 	he hadn't just been through such a traumatic experience.					DUKAT 			About my daughter. You and Major 			Kira... took care of her for almost 			a year. I wanted to thank you for 			that. It was... very generous.	Despite himself, Sisko can't help but feel just a 	little moved by the obvious pain the memory of his 	daughter causes Dukat.     STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - TEASER     5.4    CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO 			Ziyal was a very special young 			woman. It was a pleasure to have 			her with us... even if it was only 			for a short time.					DUKAT 			A short time was all she ever had.	Dukat runs a hand through his hair and a great weariness 	seems to come over him. For a moment, he doesn't look 	like a war criminal or a villain to Sisko -- just a man 	still grieving over the loss of a child.					SISKO			Is there anything I can get for you?	A quiet beat, and then Dukat musters up a smile and a 	small joke.					DUKAT 			A bottle of kanar and an Orion 			slave girl would be nice.					SISKO				(wry) 			I'll see what I can do.	Suddenly the ship is ROCKED SLIGHTLY. There's a moment 	of silence as Dukat and Sisko both instinctively look 	up at the ceiling. Then the ship goes to RED ALERT and 	is ROCKED HARD.					COM VOICE			Battle stations! Battle stations!			Damage control teams report to--	The ship is ROCKED AGAIN and AGAIN and the lights 	FLICKER. As Sisko and Dukat hold on for dear life...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT ONE     6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)5    EXT.

Her face is grim and she's carrying a PADD.					KIRA 			It's confirmed. U.S.S. Honshu was 			destroyed this morning at ten-			thirty hours by an attack wing of 			Cardassian destroyers. Starfleet 			has picked up distress beacons 			from three escape pods and one 			shuttlecraft, so there are 			survivors.	Odo points to a STAR MAP on the Ops table display.					ODO 			The signals are coming from this 			area. The Honshu's last reported 			position was here, which means 			there could potentially be 			survivors in any of these adjacent 			star systems.					O'BRIEN 			That's a pretty large area. How 			many ships are in the search party?					ODO 			Two. The Constellation and the 			Defiant.					DAX			Two?

But this convoy 			is completely unprotected. 			They've been using the plasma 			fields in the Badlands to hide 			their movements, but when they 			emerge they'll be helpless without 			the Defiant.					BASHIR 			Can't they delay the convoy? If 			Captain Sisko is still alive, we 			have to give him every chance to --					KIRA			I've made that very objection and 			the orders still stand. Now every 			minute you stand here arguing is 			one less minute you have to search 			for the captain.	A quick, frustrated beat as they realize there's no 	time to lose.					WORF 			Prepare for immediate departure.	Worf, O'Brien, Dax, and Bashir hustle to the turbolift.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT ONE    7A.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			Worf.				(he stops, then quiet				and urgent)			There are over thirty thousand			Federation troops in that convoy.			You have fifty-two hours.

CAVERN	Dukat has built a WOOD FIRE in the middle of the cave, 	which provides the primary illumination. There's a 	small stack of LOGS nearby. He's also brought in some 	field rations, blankets, tricorders, etc. from the 	shuttle. Sisko is lying on a blanket near the fire. 	His uniform jacket has been removed, his left side has 	been covered in crude bandages, and his arm is 	completely immobilized with a metallic CAST.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT ONE     9.9    CONTINUED:	The WIND can be HEARD howling outside in the b.g. 	Dukat is applying a HYPOSPRAY to Sisko's neck.					DUKAT 			Benjamin? Benjamin, can you hear 			me?	Sisko's eyes flutter and then he tries to focus on 	Dukat.					SISKO			Dukat... ?					DUKAT 			Yes. Everything's all right, but 			don't try to move too quickly. 			The left side of your body is 			covered with plasma burns.	Sisko takes a drink from the canteen, and catches his 	breath, before trying to figure out what's happened.					SISKO 			We were... in the brig... the ship 			went to Red Alert...					DUKAT 			We were attacked -- by a wing of 			Cardassian ships, ironically.					SISKO			I was heading for Engineering...					DUKAT 			You didn't get very far. A plasma 			conduit exploded before you got 			fifteen meters down the Corridor. 			That's where Lieutenant McConnell 			and I found you when the order 			came to abandon ship.					SISKO			Where's McConnell?    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT ONE    10.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					DUKAT 			Dead. A piece of shrapnel hit him 			in the head as we were carrying 			you into the shuttle.					SISKO			Any other survivors?					DUKAT 			I saw a few escape pods leaving 			the ship just before it exploded, 			but... I had my hands full after 			that trying to keep us in one 			piece. Our engines were damaged 			by the shockwave. I managed to 			set us down here -- wherever here 			is -- but that shuttle's never 			going to reach orbit again.	Dukat moves over to the com system.					DUKAT				(continuing) 			The shuttle's distress beacon was 			damaged, but I think I've managed 			to repair it.	He points to the com system where several lights are 	BLINKING.					DUKAT 			So now we wait until someone hears 			our signal.					SISKO			Whose signal are you transmitting? 			Starfleet or the Dominion?					DUKAT 			It's a general distress call. 			Whoever gets here first will find 			one comrade in arms... and one 			prisoner. That's fair, isn't it?					SISKO			Fair enough.	Sisko inspects the cast on his arm.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT ONE    11.9    CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO 			You do this?					DUKAT 				(nods) 			You shattered most of the bones			in your arm. There was a bone-			regenerator in the medkit, but I'm 			afraid I'm not much of a doctor, 			so I just put on the cast.					SISKO 			You did plenty. Thank you.	Dukat gives him a small nod and a smile before turning 	back to the fire. He throws on another log, then picks 	up a phaser and palm beacon as he prepares to head 	outside.					DUKAT 			We have enough field rations to 			last for a few weeks, but I'd feel 			better if I could locate another 			source of food and water. The 			surface is inhospitable to say the 			least, but I was able to find 			firewood and kindling, so there's 			a good chance there's edible 			vegetation out there somewhere. 			I just have to find it.					SISKO			You could've left me behind. Why 			didn't you?	Beat.					DUKAT 			I didn't want to. 				(beat) 			I'll be back within the hour.	Dukat EXITS, leaving Sisko alone in the cavern and 	feeling very lucky to be alive.10   INT.

CAVERN - DAY	The fire is still BURNING, and there's a bit of 	SUNLIGHT in the cavern now from the distant entrance 	to the tunnel. Sisko is just waking up to the smell 	of cooking. He turns his head and sees Dukat busily 	cooking a pot of something over a field stove from the 	shuttle. A pile of berries, grass, and roots sit 	nearby and Dukat occasionally mixes some of them into 	the concoction.					SISKO 			Is that breakfast?					DUKAT 			Possibly.				(beat) 			Good morning.					SISKO			Morning. What's it like outside?					DUKAT 			The wind has died down and the 			temperature's gone up twenty 			degrees.

I do			remember waking up and... feeling			a little dizzy...					DUKAT			You had a bout of nausea.				(with meaning)			And it wasn't exactly "a little."	Sisko realizes what he means and looks a little 	embarrassed.					DUKAT			But don't let it bother you --			I've had to clean up far worse in			my time.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT TWO    17.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					DUKAT (Cont'd) 			When I was a newly minted glinn 			on the Kornaire, I once had to 			help clean up a compartment where 			three men had gone through an 			explosive decompression.

Have a 			sense of humor about all this.					SISKO 			I'm not in much of a joking mood.					DUKAT 			What a shame. There's so much to 			laugh about. 				(beat) 			You don't see it, do you? Just 			a few hours ago, I was a prisoner 			on my way to trial and you were 			my old friend come to visit me in 			my cell. Now look at us -- I'm 			free, you're a prisoner of your 			own battered body, and there's a 			very good chance we'll be rescued 			by the Dominion. 				(laughs) 			You have to laugh at a universe 			that allows such radical shifts 			in fortune, Benjamin.					SISKO			I'll laugh when a Federation 			starship arrives and they put you 			back in a cell.	Dukat laughs again, refusing to take that possibility 	seriously.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT TWO    18.14   CONTINUED:	(3) 					DUKAT			Whatever you say.	Dukat ladles the soup into a bowl for Sisko -- but then 	he turns his head as if he just heard something down 	the tunnel.					SISKO			What?					DUKAT 				(beat)			Nothing. Probably just the wind.	He hands the soup to Sisko, who samples it.					DUKAT			How is it?					SISKO			Needs salt.

My "crimes." I'm 			such a monster. Such an evil man.				(beat) 			Behold Benjamin Sisko -- supreme 			arbiter of right and wrong in the 			universe. A man of such high 			moral caliber that he can sit in 			judgement on the rest of us.					SISKO				(fed up) 			What the hell do you want from me? 			My approval?    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FOUR   43.57   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO (Cont'd) 			Is that what this is all about? 			You want me to give you permission 			to cause more suffering and death? 			Well, if that's what you're after, 			you might as well pull out that 			phaser and end this right now 			because I won't give it to you!					DUKAT 			Good, I like this. No more 			pretense. No more games. Just 			you and me. And the truth.					SISKO			What do you know about the truth? 			You bend the truth around into 			whatever shape suits you.					DUKAT 			Judge Sisko hands down another 			ruling. But where's his evidence?					SISKO			All right. You really want to do 			this? Here? Now?					DUKAT 			Yes.					SISKO 			Okay. Let's do it. You were 			Prefect of Bajor during the 			Occupation. True or false?					DUKAT 			True.					SISKO 			And you were responsible for 			everything that happened under 			your command. True or false?					DUKAT 			True.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/57- ACT FOUR    44.57   CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO 			So that makes you responsible for 			the murder of over five million 			Bajorans who died on your watch. 				(a shout) 			True or false!					DUKAT 			False. I tried to save lives 			during my administration.					SISKO			Evidence?	Dukat has been waiting a long time to tell his side of 	things. once he's rolling, there's virtually no 	stopping him. He begins pacing across the cavern.					DUKAT 			Evidence? He wants evidence. By 			the time I became Prefect, the 			occupation had been going on for 			almost forty years, but the planet 			was still not ready for full-scale 			colonization. Central Command 			wanted the situation resolved and 			they didn't care how it was done. 			I was convinced that a gentler 			hand was required to deal with the 			Bajorans.	Dukat's pacing now brings him to where Damar is 	suddenly standing.					DAMAR 			It was a noble, if misguided, 			vision.	Dukat barely reacts this time to Damar's appearance. 	Damar and (in a moment) Kira & Weyoun act as Dukat's 	personal Greek chorus -- echoing and enhancing his 	"case." Dukat paces away from Damar (who is now gone 	again).    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FOUR   45.57   CONTINUED:	(4)					DUKAT 			So in my first official act as 			Prefect, I ordered all labor camp 			commanders to reduce their output 			quotas by fifty percent -- fifty 			percent! Then I reorganized the 			camps themselves. Child labor was 			abolished. Medical care was 			improved and food rations were 			increased. In the first month of 			my administration, the death rate 			dropped by more than twenty 			percent.				(beat) 			And how did the Bajorans react? 			On my one month anniversary they 			blew up an orbital drydock, 			killing over two hundred 			Cardassian soldiers and workers.	Dukat's pacing brings him to Kira.					KIRA			We didn't want reconciliation. 			We wanted to destroy you.	Dukat walks away from Kira.					DUKAT 			I had to order a response. But 			even then it was a carefully 			tempered one: I had two hundred 			suspected members of the 			Resistance rounded up and 			executed. Two hundred lives for 			two hundred lives. That was 			justice -- not malevolence --			justice.	Dukat walks back and we find Weyoun.					WEYOUN 			The Dominion would've never been 			so generous.	Dukat walks away.STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FOUR 46-46A.  57   CONTINUED:	(5)					DUKAT 			But did I give up my efforts to 			reach out to the Bajorans? No. 			I tried again. And what did I get 			for my trouble? An assassination 			attempt. On my own space station! 			Another round of executions 			followed. Again, courtesy of the 			Bajoran Resistance.					KIRA 			We never wanted peace. We hated 			you -- all of you.					DUKAT 			On and on it went, year after blood-			soaked year. Time and again, I 			would reach out with the open hand 			of friendship and time and again, 			they would slap it away.57A  NEW ANGLE	Showing Weyoun, Damar and Kira now lined up behind 	Dukat.					DAMAR 			Bajorans understand a clenched 			fist, not an open hand.					KIRA 			Being reasonable only made us 			bolder.					WEYOUN 			The Dominion would've killed every 			man, woman and child on Bajor long 			ago.					DUKAT 				(to Sisko)			I hope you're listening to all this.					SISKO			Oh, believe me, you have my 			undivided attention. Now let me 			get this straight: You're not 			responsible for what happened 			during the Occupation, the 			Bajorans are.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FOUR   47.57A  CONTINUED:					DUKAT 			Exactly.					SISKO			So why do you think they didn't 			appreciate the rare opportunity 			you were offering them?					DUKAT 				(bitter) 			Because they were blind, ignorant 			fools. They couldn't see that if 			they had only chosen to cooperate 			with us, we could've turned their 			world into a paradise. 				(beat) 			From the moment we arrived on 			Bajor, it was clear that we were 			the superior race. But they 			couldn't accept that. They wanted 			to be treated as equals when they 			most definitely were not. 			Militarily, technologically, 			culturally -- we were almost a 			century ahead of them in every way.     STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FOUR   48.57A  CONTINUED:	(2)					DUKAT (Cont'd) 				(anger building) 			We did not choose to be the 			superior race, fate handed us our 			role. It would've been so much 			easier on everyone if the Bajorans 			had simply accepted their role. 			But no... day after day they 			clustered in their temples and 			prayed for deliverance, and night 			after night they planted bombs 			outside our homes. 				(beat)			Pride. That's what it was. 			Stubborn, unyielding pride. From 			the servant girl that cleaned my 			quarters to the condemned man 			toiling in a labor camp to the 			terrorist skulking through the 			hills of Dahkur Province, they 			each wore their pride like some 			twisted badge of honor.					SISKO			And you hated them for it.	And now the pent-up hatred and bile finally comes 	roaring out of Dukat like someone opened up a flood-	gate.					DUKAT 			Of course I hated them! Their 			superstitions and their cries for 			sympathy, their treachery and 			their lies, their smug superiority 			and their stiff-necked obstinacy, 			their stupid earrings and their 			broken noses -- Yes I hated them, 			I hated everything about them!					SISKO			You should've killed them all.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FOUR   49.57A  CONTINUED:	(3)					DUKAT 			Yes!	He turns to his chorus.					DUKAT				(continuing)			That's right, isn't it?!	They all nod.					DUKAT 			I knew it! I've always known it!				(at the top of his lungs) 			I should've killed every last one 			of them and turned their planet 			into a graveyard the likes of 			which the galaxy had never seen!	A beat passes as Dukat lets the rage and fury subside 	for a moment. He stands there, catching his breath... 	and when he speaks again, it's with the quiet 	resolution of a man who's always known the truth, but 	has never let himself say it out loud.					DUKAT				(quiet, resolved)			I should've killed them all.	Suddenly, the METAL BAR comes crashing down on Dukat's 	skull and he drops down to the ground.58   SISKO	stands over him for a moment. He's unsteady on his 	feet, badly hurt and weak, but even now we can see the 	contempt and loathing he feels for the man now sprawled 	unconscious before him. (Dukat has fallen on the 	phaser, and Sisko can't get it.)					SISKO				(quiet) 			And that... is why you're not an 			evil man?	Sisko staggers out of the cavern and EXITS to the 	tunnel with all the energy he can muster. A few quiet 	seconds pass, and then...  <C>STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FOUR 49A.59   DUKAT	begins to rouse himself. He pushes himself up to his	feet... tries to focus... then lurches out of the 	cavern in pursuit of Sisko.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                             STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FIVE   50.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:60   EXT. PLANET SURFACE - NIGHT	Sisko comes stumbling out of the entrance to the tunnel 	and into the chaotic, windswept night. He tries to 	shield his eyes against the neverending storm, but 	it's still hard to see out here and he can't locate the 	shuttle for a moment -- then a FLASH of lightning 	REVEALS the shuttlecraft parked a short distance away. 	The ramp is still OPEN. He runs to it and then goes 	inside.61   INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS	Sisko hits a control panel on the bulkhead. The ramp 	begins to CLOSE again. Sisko goes to the cockpit and 	STARTS the shuttle engines, but then Dukat comes DIVING 	over the closing ramp and TACKLES Sisko to the floor.	The two men crash to the deck. There's a brief, fierce 	struggle. Sisko fights with a wild intensity propelled 	by adrenaline more than strength, but his injuries 	place him at a severe disadvantage. Dukat swiftly 	gains the upper hand and pulls the phaser. For a 	moment, the two bloodied combatants glare at each other.					SISKO 				(kill me) 			Do it!	Dukat almost does just that, but then he hits the 	control panel and the ramp LOWERS again. He grabs 	Sisko by the shirt.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FIVE   51.62   EXT. PLANET SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT	As Dukat drags Sisko down the ramp and rolls him onto 	the ground. Sisko is in agony, on the verge of passing 	out as Dukat kneels over him, breathing heavily. The 	wind howls, dust whips their faces, and lightning still 	arcs across the sky.					DUKAT 			I'm glad we had this time 			together, Benjamin. It'll be 			a while before we see each other 			again.				(beat) 			I have some unfinished business 			to take care of... on Bajor.	Sisko looks up sharply.					DUKAT 			They've pushed me too far, 			Benjamin. They took all my good 			intentions and turned them into 			something ugly... made me into 			something ugly... and now they're 			going to pay for it. They thought 			I was their enemy? They don't 			know what it is to be my enemy. 			But they will. From this day 			forward, Bajor is dead. All of 			Bajor. And this time, even their 			Emissary won't be able to save 			them.	Sisko summons his last ounce of strength and KICKS 	Dukat's right knee with all the force he can muster. 	Dukat crumples in pain, but then backhands Sisko with 	the phaser across the face. Sisko falls back, moaning 	and fighting the encroaching unconsciousness. Dukat 	holds his knee in pain and watches the still flailing 	Sisko warily, but then the captain finally succumbs and 	falls back unconscious. Dukat limps over to him for 	a moment and glares down at him, then goes into the 	shuttle.    STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE "Waltz" - REV. 11/12/97 - ACT FIVE   52.63   ANGLE - ON THE SHUTTLE 	As the ramp begins to CLOSE, we see Dukat standing 	inside with Kira, Damar and Weyoun.									CUT TO:64   EXT.
