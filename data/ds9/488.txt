SPACE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)	As the Defiant emerges from the wormhole.2    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE	WORF is in the Captain's Chair, DAX is at the helm.	N.D. Starfleet Officers man the other stations.					WORF			Prepare for arrival.	Dax operates some controls, then...					DAX			Approaching Docking Port Five.					WORF			Proceed.	Dax operates the necessary controls. Dax decides to	have a little fun with Worf now that the mission is	over.					DAX				(slightly suggestive)			The docking port's open. Mooring			clamps extended. Thrusters			engaged.	Worf looks over at Dax, somewhat disturbed by her	suggestive tone. There's an deep echoing SOUND 	as the ship links up to the station.					DAX				(playful)			Coupling complete.				(to Worf)			There's nothing so satisfying as			a nice smooth docking at the end			of a mission. Don't you think so,			commander?	Worf knows Dax is trying to get a response out of him	and decides not to play along.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar...

All			hands dismissed.	The N.D.s begin filing off the bridge. Only Dax and	Worf linger behind.					DAX			I'd call that a successful			mission. Five days in the Gamma			Quadrant and no sign of the			Jem'Hadar.	Worf nods, but his mind is on other things.					WORF			Commander, during our maneuvers			through that asteroid belt in the			Kar-telos system, I noticed the			Defiant felt a little... sluggish			when turning hard aport.					DAX				(nods)			The inertial dampening generators			may need realignment.					WORF			I'll begin drawing up a schedule			immediately. And while we're at			it, we should also recalibrate the			targeting scanners and check the			EPS relays.					DAX			O'Brien's going to be a little			disappointed. He thought he			finally had the ship running			smoothly.					WORF			Chief O'Brien has done an			excellent job. This is a fine			ship.				(a beat)			But, it is my duty to keep her			functioning at peak proficiency.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar... " - 1/08/96 - TEASER           3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Worf looks around the bridge with admiration. Dax	smiles..					DAX				(realization)			Mister Worf, you're in love.				(off Worf's look)			With the Defiant.					WORF				(bristling)			You exaggerate. As usual.				(a beat)			However, I must admit, without the			Defiant, my assignment here would			be much less... gratifying.	Dax starts to leave, glances around the bridge.					DAX			You know... I think she likes you			too.	Dax EXITS, leaving Worf alone on the bridge.3    INT. QUARK'S	O'BRIEN and Bashir are standing by the dabo wheel,	wearing gear appropriate for Irish warriors of the	early eleventh century. LEETA, Bashir's dabo girl, is	working the wheel.					BASHIR				(to O'Brien)			I feel silly.					LEETA				(chiming in)			I like it. It shows off your			legs.					O'BRIEN			There, you see. Your public has			spoken.					LEETA			Have fun.	Leeta gives Bashir a kiss on the cheek and he and	O'Brien head up the stairs to the holosuite.					BASHIR				(skeptical, to O'Brien)			What's this holosuite program of			yours called again?          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar... " - 1/08/96 - TEASER           4.3    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			The Battle of Clontarf. You and 			me and a thousand stalwart Irish 			warriors against a ravening hoard 			of Vikings. It's like the Battle 			of Britain, only with swords.					BASHIR			Why do you get to be the High 			King?					O'BRIEN			I'm a direct descendant of King 			Brian Boru.				(a beat)			Besides... it's my program.	Bashir sees that O'Brien will brook no argument.					BASHIR			I suppose it's only fair.	O'Brien and Bashir EXIT up the stairs.4    NEW ANGLE	On ROM, who is working behind the bar, moaning and 	meticulously mixing a very complicated drink with lots 	of exotic ingredients. QUARK joins him, scanning the 	bar with a worried look. Business is light and there 	are no Bajorans present.					QUARK				(re: Rom's moan)			I know exactly how you feel.				(a curse)			The Bajoran Time of Cleansing. 			Could someone explain to me why 			the Bajorans need to abstain from 			worldly pleasures for an entire 			month? I mean, it's not like 			they're a bunch of hedonistic 			holosuite-obsessed drunkards to 			begin with.	Rom moans.					QUARK				(without looking at him)			No use moaning about it.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar... " - 1/08/96 - TEASER           5.4    CONTINUED:					ROM				(in agony)			It hurts.	This gets Quark's attention. He looks over at Rom, who	is still mixing the drink.					QUARK			Who's that for?					ROM			Me. It's one of Moogie's home			remedies.					QUARK				(can't believe it)			Your ear again?	Rom pours the contents of the glass into a tall thin	beaker, adds a drop of something to make it foam and	then pours the liquid into his ear.					QUARK			That's disgusting. You want to			drive away the rest of my			customers?	Rom looks terrible. He stands up, stilling wincing in	pain and holds his ear.					ROM			I feel dizzy.					QUARK			What else is new? Now go wait on			table seven.	Just then, Leeta comes up to the bar, puts her tray	down and looks at Rom with sympathy.					LEETA			Rom, you look terrible. I think			you'd better lie down.					QUARK				(to Leeta)			I don't pay you to think. I pay			you to spin the dabo wheel. So			get spinning.	Leeta looks around at the almost empty bar.					LEETA			But no one's gambling.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar...

He needs			to lie down.					QUARK			Just because you happen to be			intimately acquainted with Doctor			Bashir's bedside manner doesn't			make you a medical expert.	Rom's looking weak and wobbly.					ROM			Brother? Am I still standing?					LEETA				(to Quark)			What I do during my time off is no			business of yours.					QUARK			If you don't get back to work this			instant, you're going to have more			time off than you know what to do			with.				(to Rom)			And the same goes for you.	Rom clenches his teeth and tries to fight past the	pain.					ROM			Yes, Brother.	But the pain is too great and he's overcome, fainting	backward out of frame. He lands with a crash. Quark	nudges him with his toe to see if he's awake, but Rom	doesn't respond. Leeta kneels down to examine him.					LEETA			Aren't you going to do something?          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar...

INFIRMARY	Bashir is treating Rom's infected ear with a high-tech	medical instrument. Rom is still hurting but not as	bad as he was before.					BASHIR			This is one stubborn infection.			How long have you had it?					ROM				(guessing)			A couple of weeks.					BASHIR				(outraged)			You mean to tell me that you've			been walking around with a seeping			infection of the tympanic membrane			for two weeks?	Rom thinks it over.					ROM			More like three, actually.					BASHIR			Rom, you could have died. Another			forty-eight hours and you'd've			been bidding for a new life in the			Divine Treasury.					ROM			I guess it's a good thing I			fainted when I did.					BASHIR			Why didn't you come to see me			sooner?					ROM			I couldn't. I was busy.					BASHIR			I'm sure your brother could've			spared you for half an hour.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar... " - 1/08/96 - ACT ONE          9.6    CONTINUED:					ROM			It would've been a violation of my			contract. Paragraph seventy-six,			subsection three. "Employees of			Quark's Bar and Holding Company			are strictly prohibited from			leaving the work environment			during business hours unless			ordered to do so by their			employer. Any failure to comply			with this provision will result in			severe fines and possible			dismissal."				(a beat)			It's a standard provision in all			Ferengi labor contracts.	Bashir is amazed by the unfairness of Rom's contract.					BASHIR			You mean you don't get time off if			you're sick.					ROM			It's all part of our...				(slightly sarcastic)			Generous employee compensation			package: "No sick days, no			vacations, no paid overtime."					BASHIR			It sounds like you need a better			contract.					ROM			There's no such thing. Ferengi			labor contracts are all the same.	Bashir finishes fixing up Rom's ear.					BASHIR			That should do it. But I want you			to see me for a follow-up first			thing tomorrow morning.	Rom gets to his feet.					ROM			It'll have to be before the bar			opens.	Bashir shakes his head. He can't believe how 	downtrodden Rom is.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar... " - 1/08/96 - ACT ONE         10.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR				(a throwaway)			What you people need is a union.	Rom is horrified at the mere mention of the word.					ROM			A what?					BASHIR				(off the cuff)			You know... a trade guild... a			collective bargaining association.			A union. Something to keep you			from being exploited.					ROM			You don't understand. Ferengi			workers don't want to stop the			exploitation. We want to find a			way to become the exploiters.	Rom turns to leave, but Bashir gets in a parting word.					BASHIR			Suit yourself. But I don't see			you exploiting anybody.	Rom can't argue with that, so instead of replying he	hurries out of the room.7    INT. QUARK'S	The bar is even emptier than it was before. It's	nearly closing time. Rom ENTERS and Leeta comes up to	see how he's doing.					LEETA			How did it go?					ROM			I'm okay.					LEETA			Julian's a wonderful doctor. Your			brother should've let you see him			weeks ago.					ROM			It's not Quark's fault that I got			sick. I forgot to get my 			bimonthly ear scan.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar... " - 1/08/96 - ACT ONE            7    CONTINUED:					ROM (Cont'd)				(embarrassed)			And besides, I've probably been			getting too much oo-mox.	Leeta smiles. She didn't know Rom was such a lady's	man.					LEETA			Really? Who's the lucky female?					ROM			No female. Just me.	Leeta realizes her pathetic image of Rom is only too	accurate.					LEETA				(pitying)			I'm sorry.	Rom brightens, never one to miss an opportunity.					ROM				(pushing his ear toward				her)			Sorry enough to do something about			it?					LEETA				(looking for an excuse)			I don't think Julian would			approve.	Rom knows there's no hope but is Ferengi enough to give	it one more try.					ROM			You could ask him.8    NEW ANGLE	Just then, Quark comes out of the back room. He clears	his throat loudly.					QUARK			All right, everyone. Gather			around. I have an announcement			to make.					LEETA				(to Rom, under her				breath)			What now?	Rom, Leeta, and the other dabo girls and Ferengi	waiters gather around Quark.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar... " - 1/08/96 - ACT ONE         12.8    CONTINUED:					QUARK			I've just been going over today's			receipts and it's not good. The			only thing this Bajoran Cleansing			Ritual has cleansed is my profit			margin. So starting tomorrow,			everyone's salary gets cut by a			third. It was either that or fire			half the staff. Don't bother			thanking me.	Quark's workers look devastated by the news, especially	Leeta.					LEETA			I can't afford a pay cut.					QUARK			It's either a pay cut or a 			layoff. You decide.			(to all)			Now everyone get back to work. I			want this place cleaned up and the			lights off in ten minutes.	The workers turn back to their task, all except for	Rom, who approaches his brother. Maybe it's the talk	he had with Bashir, or maybe he's just suffered one	indignation too many, but he's chosen this moment to	make a stand.					ROM			Brother, this isn't right. You			can't just cut people's salaries			without warning.	QUARK isn't used to having his judgement questioned and	responds with an edge.					QUARK			Actually, I can. And I have. Now			why don't you concentrate on			keeping your hands off your lobes			and leave business matters to me?					ROM			But once the Cleansing Ritual is			over you'll restore everyone's			salary, right?	Quark isn't impressed.					QUARK			That depends on next quarter's			fiscal summation.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar... " - 1/08/96 - ACT ONE         13.8    CONTINUED:	(2)	As far as Quark is concerned, this is the end of the	conversation. But Rom's not ready to give up.					ROM			Brother, I'm asking you as a			personal favor to reconsider this			pay cut.					QUARK			Anything for you.	Quark makes a show of thinking it over for a beat,	then...					QUARK			There. I've reconsidered it. My			decision stands.					ROM			But, brother...					QUARK			Don't "brother" me. In this bar			you're not my brother. You're my			employee. And employees have no			right to question the management's			decisions.	Rom goes cold. He's had just about enough.					ROM			I'm warning you, if you don't			rescind the pay cuts, you're going			to regret it.					QUARK				(dismissive)			The only thing I regret is not			being an only child.	And with that, Quark EXITS.9    CLOSE ON ROM	Who clenches his jaw, determined to make Quark see the	error of his ways.10   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR	Dax and Worf are wearing their workout gear. Worf is	carrying a bat'leth, and Dax is taking some practice	passes with the mek'leth (short sword) as they walk	down the hall.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar...

And I thrive on...	Worf's stops in his tracks and holds up his hand to	quiet her.					DAX				(softly)			What is it?					WORF				(whispers)			Listen.	Dax listens and hears a faint rustling noise from the	ceiling. She points up to the ceiling. Worf nods in	agreement, and without warning, lifts his bat'leth and	yanks open a panel from the ceiling.11   NEW ANGLE	As a Dopterian thief tumbles from a crawlspace in the	roof and falls to the floor. A bag of booty spills	down next to him. Worf points the bat'leth at the	Dopterian's chest.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar...

SECURITY OFFICE	As Worf ENTERS and flings the Dopterian thief into the	room. ODO, who was in the middle of conferring with a	deputy, reacts.					WORF			This p'tak just robbed my			quarters.					ODO				(to the Deputy)			Put him in a holding cell.	The Deputy hauls off the Dopterian.					ODO				(to Worf)			I'll need a statement.					WORF			And you'll have one. But I want			to know why such a security breach			was allowed to occur in the first			place.					ODO			Unfortunately, these things			happen.					WORF			They did not happen on the			Enterprise.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Bar...

The Nausicaans seem	to find this endlessly fascinating and continue their	game during the following:	Quark ENTERS and sees the Nausicaan's and Brunt.					QUARK				(to Brunt, re: the				Nausicaans)			Doesn't that hurt?					BRUNT			I'm sure it does.
