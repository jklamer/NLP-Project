QUARK'S	ODO and QUARK ascending the stairs to the second level.					QUARK				(anxious, mid-				conversation)			... only paid for one hour... and 			he's been in there for three... 			fighting the Battle of Klachdachbrach 			or some such thing over and over...					ODO			The Battle of Klach D'kel Brakt was 			a legendary Klingon victory over the 			Romulans almost a century ago...					QUARK			Well, he's been losing it all 			afternoon and he says he's not coming 			out until he wins... I banged on the 			door, he sealed himself in.  I 			threatened to shut off the power, he 			threatened to kill me.2    SECOND LEVEL - OUTSIDE HOLOSUITE #	As Odo and Quark approach the closed holosuite door, 	we'll hear (from within) the wild laughter of one	(o.s.) Klingon (KOR), and the sound of warrior blades	clashing in combat -- then:					KOR (O.S.)				("You'll be remembered 				with honor; now die!")			Battlda-Kow-loo-takh.  DaH Hegh!	And finally, the death scream of a vanquished foe, as:					KOR (O.S.)				("Success!")			Kkhap-LA!  ShusH-kin'Hurra!          DEEP SPACE: "Blood Oath" - REV. 01/26/94 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:	Throughout the above:					ODO			Since when did you add ancient Klingon 			battles to the holosuite programs?					QUARK			The Captain of the last Klingon ship 			that went through the wormhole sold 			some to me.  I know, I know -- it's 			brutal, it's violent, it's bloody 			but to the Klingons, it's 			entertainment.					ODO			Shut off the power.					QUARK				(scared)			He'll kill you.					ODO			No, he said he'd kill you.  Shut it 			off.	Quark produces a simple, pencil-shaped metal "key" -- inserts 	it into a single small hole in the wall alongside the door -- 	turns the key... Long beat, before:					KOR (O.S.)				("What's going on?")			chay'pen Aha'bA?3    ANGLE INCLUDING KOR	Another beat before the door is wrenched open manually from 	within -- and the elderly Klingon former-warrior KOR bursts 	out to confront Odo and Quark.  He's big, broad and a 	naturally effusive, good-natured slob.  Right now, he's very 	drunk.  In one hand, he holds a transparent bottle which is 	four-fifths empty.  (Not being in very good health, he'll be 	plagued throughout the episode by an intermittent COUGH.)	He explodes from the doorway in a rage...            DEEP SPACE: "Blood Oath" - 01/25/94 - TEASER             3.3    CONTINUED:					KOR				(senseless threatening 				roar)			AR GOT K'NEL D'KULLUH MARG RAH GOL 			LOOOOOOOOW!!!!!	Quark shrinks behind Odo... who cooly lets the Klingon blow 	off his steam...					KOR				(continuing)			You dare interrupt the Battle of 			Klach D'kel Brakt, you Ferengi k'pekt!	While Quark is, of course, cringing, Odo remains relaxed; 	implacable.  He simply takes the bottle from Kor; holds it 	up to confirm for himself, and us, that it's almost empty.					ODO			The battle has been won.  The people 			are waiting to celebrate your victory.					KOR				(stopped in his tracks)			They are?	Fine.  And, not realizing that he's actually preceding 	Odo down the stairs...					KOR			Lead the way then!4    MAIN LEVEL	as Kor descends -- eyes the crowd.					KOR				(loudly; to all)			Hear me!				(blustering)			I am Kor!  Dahar Master of the 			Klingons!	The crowd gives him the fish-eye, just another day at 	Quark's... but he smiles and embraces their glance as if it 	were a standing ovation.	And now turning to his new aide-de-camp, Odo...          DEEP SPACE: "Blood Oath" - REV. 01/26/94 - TEASER          4.4    CONTINUED:					KOR			And now I need somewhere to rest.					ODO			I have just the place.					KOR			No, this will do just fine.	And, stiff as a board, he capsizes forward to fall out of 	SHOT... As we hear the (o.s.) crash...5    OMITTED6    INT. SECURITY OFFICE - ON A MONITOR (OPTICAL)	to see Kor in a holding cell asleep, his loud snoring can be 	heard from the holding area... pulling back to find Odo at 	his desk working, frowning at the bothersome sound... the 	door to the Promenade is open... pushing in close on his 	face... taking the time to stay there a beat... and then 	suddenly Odo senses a presence nearby... his head wheels 	and he sees --7    ANGLE - ANOTHER KLINGON (KOLOTH)	The Klingon is, perhaps, even older than Kor.  But, in 	contrast, Koloth is still ramrod straight and has kept himself 	in obvious fighting trim.  Koloth has not chimed for entry, 	nor knocked on the door.  He's just standing there.  Waiting.  	His entire being has the look of coiled spring steel.  The 	man seems to have appeared out of thin air.	Odo springs to his feet ready to defend himself...					ODO			How did you get in here?	Dry, calm, cool --					KOLOTH			I am Koloth.					ODO			That doesn't answer my question.            DEEP SPACE: "Blood Oath" - 01/25/94 - TEASER             5.7    CONTINUED:					KOLOTH			Yes.  It does.	Odo raises an eyebrow, if he has one, to that.  Motioning 	toward the sound from the back room --					KOLOTH			What are the charges against him...					ODO			Charges?  No charges.  He's today's 			guest of honor.					KOLOTH				(with a very cold 				threat)			You must be a very brave man to 			attempt humor at the expense of a 			Klingon Dahar Master.	Odo measures this strange old man and does something rather 	incredible --					ODO			I... apologize.  No offense intended.	It's a rare moment, but somehow Odo realizes it was the 	necessary and correct thing to do.  Koloth barely 	acknowledges... strides back into the --8    INT. HOLDING CELL - CLOSE ON KOR'S FACE	Still out cold.					KOLOTH			Kor!	Kor stirs -- tries to get rid of the foul taste in his mouth -- 	will finally open his eyes (squinting against the light and 	the usual hangover headache) to focus in on who's disturbing 	him.9    ANGLE INCLUDING ODO & KOLOTH	Koloth looks through at Kor with disdain and disgust.       DEEP SPACE: "Blood Oath" - REV. 01/26/94 - TEASER 6-6A.         9    CONTINUED:					ODO				(to Kor)			Sir, if you'll wake up, I'll 			release you into your friend's custody.	At recognition of Koloth, Kor huffs and puffs to a sitting 	position on the bunk (still a little loaded) and, with slack-	jawed grin:					KOR			Koloth!				(sentimentally)			wIj jup... My old friend.  I knew 			you'd be here.					KOLOTH				(to Kor)			You disgrace yourself and our 			purpose.  I do not go into battle 			with one whose honor is washed 			away in Breshtanti ale...				(to Odo)			Keep him.	And that's that.  Koloth does a brisk, crisp 180, and strides 	out.  Kor looks after him -- sadly -- and then plops heavily 	back down on the bunk -- probably asleep again even as he 	hits the headrest.  Odo considers the curious events...9Athru   OMITTED 9B10   INT. OPS	DAX and KIRA at their stations.  Odo arrives on the Turbolift 	with a PADD... moves to Kira and hands it to her...					ODO			The security reassignments, Major.  			I'm sorry it took so long.  It's 			been a Klingon afternoon.					KIRA			A "Klingon afternoon"?					ODO			Every time Klingons come to the 			station, I wind up with a Klingon 			afternoon.  But this was definitely 			one that I'll cherish forever.            DEEP SPACE: "Blood Oath" - 01/25/94 - TEASER             7.10   CONTINUED:					ODO			There's a drunk Klingon in my holding 			cell who must be a hundred years old 			singing battle songs.  Even his best 			friend who's probably a hundred and 			fifty years old won't have anything 			to do with him... so I get the 			pleasure of listening to his 			repertoire.  "Kor!  Dahar Master of 			the Klingons."	Dax's face goes pale...					DAX			Did you say "Kor"?					ODO			That's what he announced right after 			he won the Battle of Klach D'kel 			Brakt in Quark's...	She rises...					DAX				(to herself)			What's he doing here... did you get 			his friend's name, Odo?  Was it Kang?	Odo reacts to her recognition...					ODO			No, it was...					DAX & ODO			...Koloth.	She moves to the Turbolift...					DAX			Come with me, Odo.	Odo exchanges a curious glance with Kira, follows Dax...11   INT.

DAX'S QUARTERS	As the door slides open and Dax leads the way in.  Kang is 	in first and he studies the surroundings, uncomfortable with 	Jadzia, considering what to do about her in his mind.  	Meanwhile, she is drawing entirely on Curzon's experience to 	guide her... and yet there is already an internal conflict 	forming within her between Curzon's commitment to these three 	and Jadzia's concern about the mission she knows they are 	here to pursue...					DAX			May I offer you some warm Bahgol... 			the replicators are Cardassian but 			we've been upgrading their...					KANG				(interrupting, remote)			That will not be necessary.	And nothing is simple here, this signals a clear reservation 	from Kang about Jadzia and she understands, doesn't move 	away from the confrontation...					DAX			Would you dishonor me by refusing my 			offer?	Kang stares at her a moment, then nods...					KANG			Very well.	She nods with a diplomatic victory and before she moves to 	the replicator, she casually moves one chair in the room to 	a dominant position and indicates it is for Kang.					DAX			Would you sit, Kang?	These are big things.            DEEP SPACE: "Blood Oath" - 01/25/94 - ACT ONE           13.18   CONTINUED:					KANG			I would.	He moves with a stoneface to the chair and sits... the others 	sit in lesser positions.  Koloth and Kor briefly bump each 	other going for the seat at Kang's left but Koloth easily 	wins that battle and Kor settles for a seat facing Kang.  	The weakest position, at Kang's right, is left open for Dax.  	Meanwhile, she is pleased they are seated and as she moves 	to the replicator...					DAX				(to replicator)			Four Bahgols.

It is held by two handles on the mid-exterior of 	the blade.  It can be used as either a shield or a sword --	see TNG episode "The Reunion.") His every moves seems a 	step out of some deadly ballet.

He gives no hint of knowing she's 	present.  Yet, suddenly, he executes a quick simultaneous 	change in direction of both feet and his overhead chopping 	lunge with the blade.	It sweeps around to speed downward toward Dax's head -- 	stopping abruptly only a couple inches from her skull.  She 	doesn't even flinch.28   ANOTHER ANGLE	They stand for a moment as they were: He facing her with 	blade two inches from her head -- she, totally unafraid and 	unflinching, still just standing there looking him straight 	in the eye.					DAX				(finally)			Nice of you to stop.				(off his silence)			I'm going with you.	Koloth lowers his blade -- moves out of attack position.					KOLOTH			Curzon Dax was a politician.

As quickly as 	with every other move of the duel, Dax goes flat on her butt.40   CLOSE - KOLOTH	Weapon raised for the final death blow; face contorted by 	the blood-rush of deadly combat; it appears for a fraction 	of a second that his very momentum itself will carry him 	through to that final, actual, death blow.41   DAX	Breathless as she sits there, waiting to die or not to die 	at his hands.
