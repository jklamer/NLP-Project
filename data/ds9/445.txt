Wouldn't you 			ask that we respect your rules if we 			were in your court?					ODO			Which raises my next point, Madame 			Archon.  I would like to move for a 			change of venue to my court... no 			crime was committed against 			Cardassia... it was in fact committed 			at a Bajoran space station...					KOVAT			Madame Archon, I am extremely 			humiliated.
