In fact, Keiko and			I have been talking about			something... we have an idea we'd			like you to consider.					KEIKO			It's just an idea... we don't want			to pressure you.					KIRA			I understand. What is it?	The O'Briens exchange a final look, still internally	debating how to put this. On Kira's curious	expression, we go to --25   OMITTED      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FOUR      39.26   INT. HOLOSUITE/QUARKIS BAR (OPTICAL)	The bar is empty. Quark is sitting at a table, eating	a plate of food which he is enjoying as if it where his	last meal. The figure of Garak approaches from behind.	Quark doesn't hear him or sense him in any way. Garak	slides his arm to his throat, and with a sharp, quick	move of his other hand, SNAPS Quark's neck. Quark	keels over into his meal, stone dead.					GAPAK			How's that?	WIDEN to include the real Quark, who's been standing to	one side, watching.					QUARK			Awful. Did you hear that sound of			bone snapping? I don't want that			to be the last thing I hear.					GARAK,			It wasn't that loud...					QUARK			You don't have these ears.			Snapping vertebrae is out.					GARAK			We're running out of options,			Quark. You don't want to be			vaporized because you need a			body... the disruptor ruined your			clothes... a knife was too			savage... the nerve gas smelled			bad... hanging took too long, and			poison... what was wrong with			poison?					QUARK			It won't work. If I know my food			is poisoned, I won't eat it.	Quark grimaces looking at the dead body.					QUARK			Can you get rid of that? The			sight of it makes me sick.					GARAK			Computer. Remove corpse.	The dead Quark disappears.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FOUR      40.26   CONTINUED:					GARAK			For a man who wants to kill			himself, you seem strangely			determined to live.					QUARK			I am going to die -- don't you			worry about that. I just want to			find the right way. I don't want			to see it coming... or hear it...			or smell it... or feel it. I just			want to go on with my life until --			(snaps fingers)			-- I'm dead.					GARAK			You want to be surprised.					QUARK			Exactly. I want to wake up in the			Divine Treasury and have no idea			how I got there.					GARAK			I see. Perhaps that can be			arranged.					QUARK			Really, how?					GARAK			If I tell you, it won't be much of			a surprise. Will it?					QUARK			That's true. All right. I leave			it up to you.	Garak gives Quark his most deadly look.					GARAK			You have my word... you'll never			know what hit you.	Garak holds his chilling stare for another beat, then	EXITS. We HOLD ON Quark as he realizes he's signed his	own death warrant.					QUARK			Computer. End program.	The holosuite reality DISAPPEARS all around Quark.27   INT. CORRIDOR	Quark ENTERS from the turbolift. The corridor is	empty. Now Quark can't help but look for Garak in	every shadow.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FOUR      41.27   CONTINUED:	Quark walks briskly down the corridor glancing over his	shoulder several times. Finally, he arrives at his	quarters and goes inside.28   INT. QUARK'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS	Quark locks the door behind him. He's scared and a	little out of breath. A sudden thought panics him and	he whirls around the room.					QUARK			Computer -- lights.	Lights come up. There's no one there. Quark slows his	breathing with relief. He moves to his bedroom.29   INT. QUARK'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS	Quark looks inside.					QUARK			Garak, if you're here... I'm not			going to be surprised.	There's no answer. Quark sits down on the bed. Takes	a deep breath, and lies back. As soon as his head hits	the pillow, we HARD CUT TO --30   INT. DIVINE TREASURY - WAITING ROOM	Gaudy doesn't begin to describe this place. It's a	latinum-covered nightmare. A few chairs, a single,	ornate door with a large Ferengi sign over it. A few	pieces of Ferengi sculpture. Everything is gold and	everything is cheap. The latinum is peeling off the	wall in a few places. Quark is standing in the middle	of the room, looking around, bewildered.					QUARK			Where am I?	Then seeing the sign over the door.					QUARK				(reading)			"Please have your profit and loss			statements ready for inspection			before entering the... Divine			Treasury."				(a beat)			I'm dead. Garak... you're good.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FOUR      42.30   CONTINUED:	And on his face of shock, we:									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      43.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:31   INT. DIVINE TREASURY - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS	Moments later. Quark looks around the room, coming to	grips with his situation.					QUARK			I'm really dead...	The ornate double doors slowly swing open, letting in a	blaze of golden light too bright to look at directly.	A CRESCENDO of Ferengi choir VOICES herald the arrival	of a FIGURE stepping out of the light. This is GINT,	a stooped, ancient Ferengi, and the First Grand Nagus.	He bears the staff and robes of a Nagus, but looks	astonishingly like a very, very old Rom.	Quark throws himself on the ground, cowering before the	spectral Nagus. The doors CLOSE, shutting off the	LIGHT and MUSIC.					GINT			You're not just dead, Quark...			you're an idiot.	Quark shoots up a look at the very sound of Gint's	voice. It sounds strangely familiar to him.					QUARK			Who are you?					GINT			I am Gint. The First Grand Nagus.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      44.31   CONTINUED:					QUARK			You look like... like my brother,			Rom.					GINT			That's because this is a dream,			you imbecile.	Quark starts to get up, a sudden realization on his	face. Quark stands, looks around.					QUARK			So, I'm not dead...					GINT			What a clever boy... always			thinking.					QUARK			I'm asleep. That explains why			this place looks so tacky. I			mean...				(gestures around)			The Divine Treasury? Please.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      45.31   CONTINUED:	(2)					GINT			Don't blame me for your limited			imagination. Now, I'll make it			simple. You have to break the			contract with Brunt.					QUARK			You gotta be joking. You're Gint.			You wrote the Rules of			Acquisition. The sacred precepts			upon which all Ferengi society is			based. You can't really expect me			to break them.					GINT			Why not? They're just rules...			they're written in a book, not			carved in stone. And even if they			were in stone, so what? A bunch			of us just made them up.					QUARK			Are you saying they don't matter?					GINT			Of course they matter. That's why			they're a best-seller... but we're			talking about your life here. The			Rules are nothing but guideposts,			suggestions...					QUARK			Then why call them Rules?					GINT			Would you buy a book called			"Suggestions of Acquisition"?			Doesn't quite have the same ring			to it, does it?					QUARK			You mean it was a marketing ploy?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      46.31   CONTINUED:	(3)					GINT			A brilliant one... Rule of			Acquisition two hundred thirty-			nine: "Never be afraid to mislabel			a product."	This is all difficult for Quark to accept.					QUARK			I've built my entire life around			these rules. How can I just walk			away from them?					GINT			Because I'm telling you to.					QUARK			But you can't do that -- you're			not Gint... this is just a dream.					GINT			Exactly. And I wouldn't be here			if you didn't want to break the			Rules. You just need someone's			permission. So I'm giving it to			you.	Quark is struggling with all this; now trying to	rationalize...					QUARK				(more to himself)			I suppose if First Nagus Gint came			to me in a vision, and told me to			break the Rules... that would be			all right.					BRUNT (O.S.)			Hold it right there.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE     46A.31   CONTINUED:	(4)	Quark turns to see Brunt, sitting in one of the chairs.					BRUNT			Brunt... F.C.A.					QUARK			What are you doing here? This is			a private vision.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      47.31   CONTINUED:	(5)					BRUNT			I'm here to remind you of the			consequences of disregarding the			Rules. Poverty, destitution,			exile...					QUARK			I know, I know. But look -- Gint			himself has come to me in a			vision. He's telling me to break			the contract.					BRUNT			That is not Gint. Gint was a lot			taller.	Gint straightens up a little, slightly insulted.					BRUNT				(to Quark)			Listen to that fraud and you'll			regret it for the rest of your			miserable life.	Gint lifts his staff with menace.					GINT				(to Quark, re: Brunt)			I say we kill him, right now.					BRUNT			This is a dream. You can't kill			me.				(standing up and moving				over to Quark,				menacingly)			However, people have been known to			die in their sleep.	Brunt advances against Quark, who backs away and looks	toward Gint for help.					QUARK			Come on Rom... Gint... whatever			your name is -- help me!					GINT					(sorry)			He's got a point, Quark. It's a			dream... I can't really do			anything.	Quark is now backed up against the wall. Brunt grabs	Quark by the neck and starts CHOKING him.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      48.31   CONTINUED:	(6)					GINT			But if you want to live --32   CLOSE ON QUARK	as Brunt tries squeezing the life out of him.					GINT (O.S.)			Break the contract... it's your			only hope.									MATCH CUT:33   INT. QUARK'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM	CLOSE ON QUARK as he jolts himself awake -- PANTING --	his own hands at his throat. He looks at them,	horrified, letting out a SCREAM. Then realizing he's	awoken from the dream...					QUARK			I'm alive...	But the joy of the moment quickly vanishes as the	reality of his situation returns. He has to make a	decision. He lies there, catching his breath.34   INT. QUARK'S	Brunt is sitting at a table, lasciviously chatting with	a dabo girl. Quark ENTERS, carrying a PADD, and steps	up to Brunt's table.					BRUNT				(to Dabo girl)			I find it surprising that someone			with such long, slender and nimble			fingers has never practiced oo-mox.	Quark waves away the dabo girl. She EXITS. Brunt	looks up at Quark expectantly.					BRUNT		Come to beg for your life?	Quark doesn't answer; he simply tosses the PADD onto	the table in front of Brunt.					BRUNT			What is this?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      49.34   CONTINUED:					QUARK			I'm returning your five hundred			bars of latinum. Plus interest.					BRUNT			I told you I wasn't interested in			a refund.					QUARK			I know. I'm breaking the			contract.	Brunt smiles and leans back. Victory is always his.					BRUNT			I knew it. You're just like the			rest of your family... weak-lobed			degenerates. Another loser in a			long line of failed Ferengis.					QUARK				(cutting him off)			Look, I've broken the contract so			do your job -- take my assets,			revoke my Ferengi business			license... do whatever you have to			do, then get out. And if I ever			see you walk into my bar again...	Brunt stands up, staring Quark down.					BRUNT			Yes?					QUARK			You won't walk out.	The two men stare at each other, neither showing any	signs of intimidation. Brunt finally smiles and turns	to address the entire bar.					BRUNT			Your attention, please.	Then, marching through the crowd --					BRUNT			Brunt... F.C.A. As of this			moment, no further Ferengi			commerce may be conducted in this			bar...	Brunt slaps the F.C.A. insignia on the wall near the	front door.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      50.34   CONTINUED:	(2)					BRUNT			... no Ferengi may be employed in			this bar... no Ferengi may eat or			drink in this bar... and no			Ferengi may do business with --				(pointing an accusatory				finger)			-- that man.	Everyone looks at Quark, who is resigned to his fate.	Quark nods to the waiters, giving them permission to	leave. The waiters put down their trays and file out	the door.					BRUNT			The confiscation of assets will			begin immediately.					QUARK			Ladies and gentlemen, the bar is			closed until further notice.			Thank you for your patronage...	Quark sits down and watches impassively as all his	customers leave. Brunt gives Quark one final smile of	victory, then heads out the door.35   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)	Re-establishing.36   INT. O'BRIENS' QUARTERS	CLOSE ON the door as it opens to reveal Kira, carrying	a single suitcase. She ENTERS. O'Brien steps up to	Kira. In the b.g. Keiko sits on the couch watching	Molly play with a toy.					O'BRIEN			I'll take that, maj-- Nerys.				(re: the single bag)			Is this it?					KIRA			I travel light.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      51.36   CONTINUED:					KEIKO			Would you like to see your room?					KIRA			Sure.	They lead her to a bedroom door.37   INT. O'BRIENS' QUARTERS - KIRA'S NEW BEDROOM	The O'Briens have decorated the room with flowers and	have installed a Bajoran shrine in one corner. Kira	walks in and smiles at the thoughtfulness of the	shrine. There's a slight, awkward moment which Keiko	breaks by stepping up to Kira and hugging her.					KEIKO			Welcome to your new home.					KIRA			At least until the baby's born.	O'Brien smiles in support and agreement. Molly comes	in and goes to Kira.					MOLLY			Are you my aunt?					KIRA				(looking at the O'Briens				for help)			Well...	Keiko and O'Brien nod and smile.					O'BRIEN			Sounds right to me.					KIRA				(then nodding, to Molly)			Aunt Nerys.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      52.37   CONTINUED:	Molly is fine with that.					MOLLY					(to Kira)			Aunt Nerys, can I play in your			room?					KIRA			Any time.	And as Molly puts her toys down on the floor, Kira	settles in with her new family.38   INT. QUARK'S	Quark is sitting on the only chair remaining in the	otherwise empty and stripped bar. Brunt's men have	taken all the barware, decorations, gaming tables,	chairs, stools, etc. There are F.C.A. seals on the	walls of the bar and whatever has yet to be taken away.	Quark seems resigned to his destitute fate as Rom	ENTERS.					ROM			How are you, Brother?					QUARK				(matter of fact)			How am I? I'm broke. Ruined.			Destitute. A pariah.				(a beat)			How are things with you?					ROM			Not bad.					QUARK			Glad to hear it.	Rom looks around the room.					ROM			They took everything?					QUARK			Including this shirt. I'm			supposed to send it to Brunt in			the morning.					ROM			Don't worry. I have some old			clothes I was going to throw out.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      53.38   CONTINUED:					QUARK			I'd rather be naked.					ROM			Okay.				(a beat)			Brother... The way you stood up to			Brunt... well, I want you to know			that I'm very proud of you.					QUARK			Oh. Well, then I guess throwing			my entire life away was worth it.					ROM			I wouldn't go that far.				(a beat)			So, what are you going to do now?					QUARK			Well, Rom... I've been thinking			Long and hard. And you know what?				(a beat)			I don't have a clue.	Rom nods. A long silence that's not broken until	Bashir ENTERS, carrying a case of bottles.					BASHIR			Quark, where do you want this?					QUARK			What is it?					BASHIR			A case of Alvanian brandy.	Bashir sets it on the bar.					BASHIR			A patient sent it to me as			payment. But I can't accept it.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Body Parts" - REV. 04/08/96 - ACT FIVE      54.38   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			Nice try, Doctor. But I don't			want your charity.					BASHIR			It's not charity. I find this			undrinkable. Now do you want it			or should I dump it?					DAX (O.S.)			Quark. Quark turns to see Dax ENTER with a box of glassware.					DAX			My sister sent me these. I			thought you might want them.			They're really ugly.	Rom picks up a glass.					ROM			They're not as ugly as the old			ones, but they're pretty bad.					QUARK			This is all very amusing, but I			can't start a bar with a case of			bad brandy and a set of ugly			glasses.					SISKO (O.S.)			Quark!	Quark looks to see Sisko approaching.					QUARK			Yes, captain?					SISKO			We're doing some structural repair			work on level two of the Habitat			Ring.

Quark has to step out of the	way of the incoming furniture, then puts his foot down:					QUARK			Captain -- you can't do this!	Everyone stops, turns to look at Quark. Quark looks	around at all the faces of his friends that have come	to help him in his time of need... he reconsiders his	position.					QUARK			Not without paying a storage fee.				(a beat)			A minimal storage fee.			Practically nothing.					SISKO				(smiles)			Send me a bill.	Quark's dignity restored, he takes charge:					QUARK			All right.				(to Odo)			Well, don't just stand there, Odo.			Move it all in.	And as everyone continues to move in the furniture,	Bashir and Dax start unpacking the liquor and glasses.39   NEW ANGLE	to see Rom approach Quark.
