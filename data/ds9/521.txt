SISKO'S QUARTERS	Close on NOG as he holds up a piece of calamari on the 	tip of a fork.					NOG			Squid! My favorite Human food.	He pops it in his mouth and chews it.2    NEW ANGLE	To include SISKO and JAKE, who are sharing their dinner 	with Nog. It's calamari pasta with a brownish sauce.					NOG				(talking with his mouth				full)			Mmm. Delicious, sir.					JAKE			Terrific as always, Dad.					SISKO 			I'm glad you like it.					NOG 			Sir... if I may say so... this 			sauce tastes very familiar.					SISKO			It should. It's puree of tube 			grubs.	A disgusted Jake drops his fork.					JAKE 			Tube grubs?					SISKO 			I figured if Nog is willing to eat 			squid, it's only fair that we try 			tube grubs. Besides, you said it 			was terrific.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED:					JAKE			That was before I knew what it 			was.					SISKO			Eat. You need more meat on your 			bones.	Jake reluctantly picks up his fork and resumes eating.					SISKO 			So, Nog... how do you like working 			security?					NOG 			It's... very interesting, sir.					JAKE 			That's not what you told me.					NOG 				(sharp) 			Jake.					SISKO			Something wrong?					NOG 			No, sir. Everything's quite 			satisfactory. Thank you, sir.					JAKE 			Could've fooled me.	Nog glares at Jake.					SISKO 			Cadet, if there's a problem, I 			want to hear about it.	Nog doesn't really want to talk about this, but...					NOG 			Well, sir... It's the Klingons, 			sir.					SISKO			What about them?					NOG 			It's their... attitude, sir. It's 			bad.					SISKO			Bad?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - TEASER         3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Nog warms up to the subject.					NOG			They're loud, obnoxious, and if I 			may say so sir, generally 			intoxicated. They walk around the 			station like they own the place. 			And whenever a station security 			officer tries to talk to them, say 			to ask them to keep the noise 			level down on the Promenade... 			they ignore him.					JAKE 			You mean they ignore you.	Nog's chagrined. He hates to admit it, but it's true.					NOG 			They never look me in the eye when 			I talk to them, sir. They just 			stare over my head and pretend I'm 			not even there.				(a beat) 			I hate it when they do that.					SISKO			I can see how that might be 			annoying.					JAKE 			Not as annoying as listening to 			him complain about it all the 			time.					SISKO			Here's what I suggest, cadet. 			Next time the Klingons refuse to 			acknowledge your presence... do 			what a Klingon would do. Confront 			them about it. If you stand up to 			them, you'll earn their respect.					JAKE 			Or get your butt kicked... one or 			the other.					SISKO			Either way, they'll never ignore 			you again.	Just then, the door CHIMES.					SISKO			Enter.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - TEASER         4.3    ANGLE ON THE DOOR	As General MARTOK, the commander of DS9's Klingon 	garrison, ENTERS.					MARTOK 			Captain, I need to speak to you.				(without looking at Jake 				or Nog) 			Alone.	Nog throws down his napkin and stands up, ready to 	confront Martok.					NOG 			That does it.					SISKO				(a word to the wise) 			Not now, Nog.					NOG 			But sir...	Jake takes a hold of Nog's arm.					JAKE 			Let's go.	Jake half drags Nog out the door.4    CLOSE ON SISKO AND MARTOK	Martok's attention remains focused on Sisko.					MARTOK 			Captain, my crew and I were 			patrolling the Cardassian border, 			and we intercepted a very 			disturbing message.	He hands Sisko a Klingon PADD. Sisko looks at the 	readout.					SISKO				(surprised) 			This is a Maquis code.					MARTOK 			I was as surprised as you. I 			thought the Maquis had been wiped 			out by Cardassia and their 			Dominion allies. But it would 			appear I was mistaken.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - TEASER         5.4    CONTINUED:					SISKO			Were you able to decode it?	Martok reaches out and hits a button on the PADD.5    CLOSE ON THE PADD (OPTICAL)	As the numerical data is replaced by the face of an 	attractive Maquis Woman in her early thirties. Let's 	call her REBECCA.					REBECCA 			Michael. I hope you get this 			message. We've launched the 			missiles. They should reach 			Cardassia in thirteen days. It 			may not bring back our dead, but 			at least they're going to have a 			lot of company.	The message ends.6    CLOSE ON SISKO AND MARTOK	Now Sisko looks as worried as Martok.					SISKO			Did you detect any missiles?					MARTOK 			No. But that proves nothing. 				(a reluctant admission) 			A few months ago, the Klingon high 			council decided to aid the Maquis 			in their fight against Cardassia. 			We provided them with thirty Class-			Four cloaking devices. It was our 			understanding that they would use 			them on their ships.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - TEASER         6.6    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			But they could've been mounted on 			missiles instead.					MARTOK 			You see the problem.					SISKO			The Maquis had access to tricobalt 			explosives, biogenic weapons, anti-			matter warheads...					MARTOK 			The death toll could be in the 			millions.	Sisko still doesn't want to believe it.					SISKO 			I knew the Maquis were desperate, 			but I can't believe they'd resort 			to something like this.					MARTOK 			A saber bear is most deadly when 			it is trapped without hope of 			escape.					SISKO			Cardassia's under Dominion 			protection. If millions of their 			citizens are killed by human 			terrorists, they'll demand 			revenge.					MARTOK 			And their new Dominion allies will 			see that they get it. They'll 			launch a counterstrike against the 			Federation, the Klingon Empire, 			the entire Alpha Quadrant.					SISKO			And begin a war that could destroy 			us all.7    CLOSE ON SISKO	As he reacts to the enormity of the problem and we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

Without 			success.					DAX			We would've stayed longer, but we 			had a hard time avoiding Jem'Hadar 			patrols.					O'BRIEN 			Let me guess... they homed in on 			your plasma wake.					DAX 				(nods) 			Even though we were cloaked, they 			were still able to track us.					O'BRIEN 				(to Sisko) 			The Defiant's warp engines are too 			powerful.

His lack of enthusiasm at what 	he sees is palpable.					EDDINGTON 			I'm dreaming, right? This is a 			nightmare.13   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	To reveal Sisko, standing outside Eddington's cell, 	flanked by two Starfleet Security Officers.					SISKO 			It's a nightmare, all right. But 			you're wide awake.	Eddington sits up on his bunk.					EDDINGTON 			I was wondering when you'd show 			up. I expected to see you here 			weeks ago.					SISKO 			I've been busy.					EDDINGTON 			But now you're here. So enjoy 			yourself. Savor the moment. I 			know you've been wanting to gloat 			over my defeat for a long time.					SISKO 			I'm not here to gloat.					EDDINGTON 			You deserve to. You won. I 			betrayed Starfleet by joining the 			Maquis. You swore you'd track me 			down, and you did. You got your 			revenge.					SISKO			Actually, that's what I'm here to 			talk to you about. Revenge.					EDDINGTON 			One of my favorite topics.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "B1aze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - ACT ONE       9A.13   CONTINUED:	Sisko nods to one of the security officers.

It's the same message Martok gave to 	Sisko.					REBECCA				(on the monitor) 			Michael. I hope you get this 			message. We've launched the 			missiles. They should reach 			Cardassia in thirteen days.	Eddington turns it off, interrupting the playback.					SISKO 			Don't you want to hear the rest?					EDDINGTON 			Why should I? It has nothing to 			do with me. Michael is a very 			common name.					SISKO			True. But somehow I think you're 			the right one.					EDDINGTON 			Guess again.	Eddington lays back down. As far as he's concerned, 	this meeting is over.					SISKO				(trying to stay calm) 			If those missiles hit Cardassia it 			could start a war. Billions of 			people could be killed.					EDDINGTON			If you expect me to shed a tear, 			you're going to be disappointed. 			I used up all my tears when the 			Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. 			I sat here in this cell for three 			days and listened to the reports 			as they came in. In those three 			days, everyone and everything I 			cared about was wiped out.					SISKO			I heard the same reports. It was 			a tragedy.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

And I don't 			give a damn about what happens to 			you.					SISKO			I don't believe that. You may've 			taken off the uniform, but you're 			still a Starfleet officer. And 			you don't want a war between the 			Federation and the Dominion any 			more than I do.					EDDINGTON 			What you want and what I want 			doesn't really matter. There's 			nothing either one of us can do to 			stop those missiles from hitting 			their targets. They're cloaked, 			highly maneuverable, programmed to 			change course at random. You'll 			never find them.	Sisko thinks this over.					SISKO 			All right. Maybe we can't locate 			the missiles, but that doesn't			mean we can't stop them. You 			must've programmed in an abort 			code, a way to deactivate the 			missiles by remote.					EDDINGTON 			Even if there was such a thing... 			you'd have to transmit it from the 			launch site. And I don't think 			you're going to find that, either. 			No code, no launch site... I'm 			afraid you're out of luck, 			captain.				(a self-satisfied smile) 			Looks like everyone's out of luck.	But Sisko doesn't look ready to give up just yet.					SISKO 			That's it?

RUNABOUT	Sisko comes from the back carrying two plates of food, 	one of which he sets down in front of Eddington.					SISKO			Dinner.	Eddington holds up his handcuffed hands.					EDDINGTON			What about these?					SISKO			What about them?					EDDINGTON 			Makes it a little difficult to 			eat.					SISKO			You'll manage.	Sisko sits down to eat his own dinner. Eddington 	awkwardly takes a bite.					EDDINGTON 			Replicator entree number one-oh-			three: Curried chicken and rice 			with a side order of carrots. Or 			at least that's what they want us 			to believe. But you and I both 			know what we're really eating. 			Replicated protein molecules and 			textured carbohydrates.					SISKO			It's not that bad.					EDDINGTON 			It may look like chicken, but it 			still tastes like replicated 			protein molecules to me.					SISKO			If you don't want it, don't eat it.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - ACT TWO       16.21   CONTINUED:					EDDINGTON 			Remember that Thanksgiving dinner 			you cooked for the senior staff			last year? How many months did it 			take you to grow all those 			vegetables in the hydroponic 			garden? Every ingredient fresh... 			real.				(a beat) 			Though you did put too much 			tarragon in the stuffing.					SISKO 			I wasn't aware you were a food 			critic.					EDDINGTON 			I wasn't. Until I joined the 			Maquis and started eating real 			food. Food that I'd grown with my 			own hands. Fresh corn. As sweet 			as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. 			Do you know how hard it is to grow 			tomatoes? There's always too much 			rain... or not enough. It's too 			hot, it's too cold.				(a beat) 			I wonder what happened to those 			tomato plants.				(bitter) 			Probably burned to the ground 			along with everything else.	Disgusted with the food, Eddington gets up and puts his 	tray in the replicator.					SISKO 			If we don't stop those missiles, 			a lot of things are going to burn 			to the ground. And not just on 			Cardassia.					EDDINGTON 			You never give up, do you, Ben? 			Here we are, having a pleasant 			conversation about food, and all 			you're thinking about is the 			mission. And how to get me to 			cooperate.				(a beat) 			You're wasting your breath. As 			far as I'm concerned my life is 			over. I'm dead.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

I told 			you when you dragged me out of my 			cell that I wasn't going to help 			you. I meant it then and I mean 			it now.	Sisko gets up and crosses to Eddington.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

You could've looked the 			other way. You could've left the 			Maquis alone. But you didn't do 			it. You hunted us. Hounded us. 			Fought us every chance you got. 			And in the end, you set us up for 			the slaughter. 				(a beat) 			I expected better of you than 			that. So did a lot of people. 			People like Cal Hudson.	That name gets Sisko's attention.					EDDINGTON 				(continuing) 			I bet you haven't heard that name 			in a while.					SISKO				(softly) 			You're right about that.					EDDINGTON 			He told me the two of your were 			friends at the Academy.					SISKO			And a long time after that.					EDDINGTON			Until he joined the Maquis.	Sisko reacts with more sadness than anger.					SISKO 			He betrayed his oath to Starfleet.					EDDINGTON 			If it makes you feel any better, 			he paid for his "sins." He was 			killed in a skirmish with the 			Cardassians.	Sisko turns away to hide his emotions from Eddington. 	He's taking this hard.					SISKO			He was a good man.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - ACT TWO       19.21   CONTINUED:	(4)					EDDINGTON 			He felt the same way about you.				(a beat) 			He thought you were wrong about 			the Maquis. But he forgave you. 			Which is ironic, considering you 			never forgave him. You can't 			forgive any of us. And not 			because we betrayed Starfleet or 			the Federation... but because we 			betrayed you.	Sisko doesn't answer this. He's still reeling from the 	news of Cal Hudson's death.					EDDINGTON				(going in for the kill) 			That's what this is all about. 			Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko 			leads, all must follow.	Sisko turns back to Eddington.					SISKO			Is that what you believe?	Eddington gets in Sisko's face.					EDDINGTON 			It's the truth, isn't it? The 			Maquis were never much of a threat 			to the Federation. But we were a 			threat to you. Our existence was 			a stain on your record. And you 			couldn't have that. Not when you 			were so busy measuring yourself 			for an admiral's uniform.	Sisko's had enough.					SISKO 			You want to blame me for what 			happened to the Maquis? Fine. Go 			ahead. Blame me. Blame 			Starfleet. Blame the Federation. 			Blame everyone but Michael 			Eddington.					EDDINGTON				(defensive) 			The Maquis won its greatest 			victories under my leadership.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

Michael 			Eddington gets to take off his 			gold uniform and play hero. Isn't 			that what you always wanted? To			lead troops in a glorious cause.				(cold) 			Well, you had your chance. And 			look where you led them. Right 			into their graves.	This takes some of the wind out of Eddington's sails.					EDDINGTON 			They died because I wasn't there 			when they needed me most. Because 			you put me in jail.					SISKO			They died because you filled their 			heads with false hopes. Sold them 			dreams of a military victory when 			what they needed was a negotiated 			peace.					EDDINGTON 			We had the Cardassians on the run.					SISKO			And they ran right into the arms 			of the Dominion.				(a beat) 			End of story.	Sisko's had his say. He sits down.					EDDINGTON 			Not quite the end.					SISKO			That's right. A few survivors 			from your noble crusade have 			decided to launch a pointless 			retaliatory strike against 			Cardassia.					EDDINGTON 			It's not so pointless. If you 			can't have victory, sometimes you 			just have to settle for revenge.	Eddington takes his seat.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - ACT TWO       21.21   CONTINUED:	(6)					SISKO 			Is that what you want? To be 			remembered as the man who helped 			bring about the worst war in 			Federation history?					EDDINGTON 			Not quite the legacy I had in 			mind, but I can live with it.					SISKO 			Can you?22   CLOSE ON EDDINGTON	As he turns away from Sisko, not giving an inch.23   INT. QUARK'S	Close on two Klingons playing the Klingon head-butting 	game as Martok and a fourth Klingon watch.					MARTOK				(loudly egging them on) 			You can do better than that. 			You're barely making contact.	The Klingons go at it even harder. We...									PAN TO:24   NOG 	Sitting at a table watching the Klingons with a steely 	look in his eyes. He's rocked his chair back a la 	Henry Fonda in "My Darling Clementine" and is balancing 	himself on the back two legs. Jake sits next to him, 	feet firmly on the floor. There's a CRACK as the 	Klingons bang heads. Jake winces.					JAKE 			I don't care what anyone says. 			That has got to hurt.					NOG 			They're at sixty-five decibels. 			Loud, but not loud enough.					JAKE			What are you talking about?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

He waits to see 	if Nog's going to smile. But the Ferengi doesn't crack 	a grin.					JAKE 			You're going to arrest General 			Martok for disturbing the peace?					NOG 			I am.					JAKE 			Aren't you going to at least call 			for some backup?					NOG 			Jake, you heard what your father 			said. They won't respect me until 			I stand up to them. Alone.					JAKE 			Personally, I think respect is 			overrated.	Nog concentrates, still rocking his chair as he 	monitors the noise level. An especially loud round of 	laughter comes from the Klingon table.					NOG 			That's it. Seventy decibels. 			They're mine.	But as Nog pushes his leg away from the table to get 	up, he shoves to hard and rocks back out of control. 	For a moment he teeters awkwardly, then with a loud...					NOG 			Whoaaa!	Nog crashes backward to the ground.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze... " - REV. 03/21/97 - ACT TWO       23.25   NEW ANGLE 	Everything stops in the bar. Martok and the Klingons 	look over at Nog, and then explode with laughter. Jake 	goes to check on Nog.					JAKE 			You okay?	Nog lies on his back and looks up at Jake.					NOG 			I'm fine. Just tell me when 			everyone leaves.					JAKE 			Why?					NOG 			Because I'm not getting up until 			they do.26   EXT.

It's hard to get an 			accurate sensor reading in the 			Badlands. But if I'm not 			mistaken, there're two Jem'Hadar 			warships headed our way.	Eddington lifts his head up, and for a moment it looks 	like this is a situation that might engage his 	attention.					EDDINGTON				(looks at the readouts) 			Yeah. Those are Jem'Hadar 			warships all right. You've got a 			problem.					SISKO			We both do.				(a beat) 			They're getting closer. One AU 			away. Point Nine AU. You said 			you wanted to get blown to bits by 			the Jem'Hadar.

They're almost on 			top of us.		Sisko sips his raktajino.					SISKO 			I'll say one thing about these 			replicators. They make good 			Klingon coffee.	Suddenly an alarm goes off on the control panel.					EDDINGTON 			They're scanning us.					SISKO 			Should be in firing range any 			minute now.					EDDINGTON 			Very clever, captain. But it's 			not going to work. I am not going 			to take the helm.					SISKO			Fine.					EDDINGTON 			That is what you're trying to do.	Sisko just takes another sip of raktajino.					EDDINGTON				(insistent) 			Isn't it?					SISKO			I'm just trying to see how serious 			this death wish of yours really 			is. I'm betting it doesn't even 			exist. Just like I'm betting you 			won't be able to sit back and let 			your friends start a war that 			could destroy the Alpha Quadrant.					EDDINGTON 			That's an awfully big bet.					SISKO			I don't think so.	Eddington knows his bluff has been called but he hates 	to give Sisko the satisfaction.					SISKO				(a challenge) 			Point Seven AU.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

Sisko almost loses his 	balance. He recovers, then steps up behind Eddington 	and watches him pilot the ship.					SISKO			Can you lose them?					EDDINGTON 				(nods) 			I plotted a spiral course around 			a plasma filament. It should 			dissipate our warp signature.					SISKO			Very fancy.					EDDINGTON 			You can take over now.					SISKO			I don't think so.	Sisko sits down in the passenger seat and stretches his 	legs out, getting comfortable.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

Slowly and carefully, they take a few more 	steps into the fog, both straining to see just a few 	yards ahead of them.54   NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV	As suddenly two figures emerge from the fog.

One of them motions to the other 	to move to the left. His partner nods, but before he 	can move out, they hear the BING of a pipe hitting 	stone.	They turn in the direction of the sound. There's 	another BING. They turn again. The sound is moving to 	their right. As their bodies shift to the right, 	anticipating yet another Bing, Sisko suddenly charges 	out of the fog from their left.	He clubs one Jem'Hadar in the head, dazing him. The 	other spins to fire, but Sisko deflects the rifle as 	the Jem'Hadar pulls the trigger and the shot goes wide.	The stunned Jem'Hadar struggles to his feet, but as he	lifts his rifle, he's shot by a phaser. He goes down.	Sisko continues his struggle with the remaining 	Jem'Hadar.58   ANGLE ON EDDINGTON	Who has risen up from behind the drums and is aiming 	into the darkness and fog.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

Maybe that way the 			other Jem'Hadar will look for 			their friends and not for us.	Sisko and Eddington each grab a Jem'Hadar by the legs 	and start pulling them away into the fog.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Blaze...

Just then, the dead Jem'Hadar's 	communicator sparks to life.					JEM'HADAR COM VOICE 			Patrol team two report... Patrol 			team two...	The voice is cut off as Sisko dumps the body into the 	well.					SISKO 			In a couple of minutes this whole 			settlement is going to be crawling 			with Jem'Hadar.

Eddington tries to key in a 	punch code at the door panel, but nothing happens. 	Sisko raises his rifle.					EDDINGTON 			No. Wait. I don't want to damage 			any of the equipment. Let me try 			something.	Eddington wrenches open the panel and manipulates the 	controls from the inside. The door opens.72   INT. MAQUIS COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT	Close on the door as Sisko and Eddington ENTER.	Sisko is stopped short by the surprising sight that 	greets his eyes.	A DOZEN MAQUIS PRISONERS stand in the center of the 	room, looking expectantly at the door.
