PROMENADE	JAKE is walking along the Promenade when a lovely young Human 	Girl named LEANNE catches his attention.					LEANNE			Jake!	Jake turns and gives her a big smile.  Leanne is a little 	older than Jake and has a confident, easy quality to her.					JAKE			Leanne.  I thought you were on Bajor.					LEANNE			I came back early.				(beat)			You know, I was just thinking about 			you.					JAKE			Really?					LEANNE			Yeah... I passed by the Klingon 			restaurant and I was thinking about 			the time you and I and Orak were 			having dinner...					JAKE			And you ordered the gagh...	They both chuckle at the memory.					JAKE			How is Orak?  I haven't talked to 			him in awhile.	Leanne brushes this off, but there's a quick look of regret 	on her face.					LEANNE			We stopped seeing each other a few 			weeks ago.         DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/11/94 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED:					JAKE				(surprised)			Oh.	Leanne glances away then back at Jake awkwardly.					LEANNE			So... are you doing anything tomorrow 			night?					JAKE			I'm supposed to be playing dom-jot 			with Nog.	Leanne looks a little disappointed and Jake quickly changes 	his tune.					JAKE			But they're not really firm plans.  			In fact, I was thinking of canceling 			them.					LEANNE			Really?  Well... if you do cancel... 			would you be interested in... dinner?					JAKE				(quickly)			Sure.	She smiles back at him and the sexual tension rises a notch.					LEANNE			Great.  How 'bout eighteen hundred 			at the Klingon restaurant?					JAKE			I'll be there.  But this time we'll 			skip the gagh.					LEANNE			Definitely.  See you then.	Leanne leaves.  Jake looks after her for a moment with an 	obviously happy look on his face.  But just as he's savoring 	the moment, suddenly O'BRIEN, ODO, and TWO N.D. SECURITY 	GUARDS come running down the Promenade.					ODO			Look out!         DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/11/94 - TEASER         3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN			Move aside!	Jake and the other Passersby on the Promenade quickly scatter 	out of the way as the group rushes by.									CUT TO:2    INT. AIRLOCK	As O'Brien, Odo, and the Guards come pounding up to the 	Airlock door.  BASHIR and a NURSE run up from another 	direction, carrying medical cases and equipment.  Odo goes 	to a wall console.  The mood is tense and urgent.					BASHIR			What do we have?					O'BRIEN			Bajoran transport coming in.  They 			said there was some kind of accident 			on board and they've got casualties.					ODO				(off console)			They're docking...					BASHIR			We should've beamed the wounded 			directly to the Infirmary.					O'BRIEN				(shakes his head)			They have a loose plasma coil.  We 			couldn't beam through the radiation.					ODO				(off console)			Docking clamps secure.  I'm opening 			the airlock.  Stand back.	He works for a moment, then the airlock OPENS, and a CLOUD 	OF SMOKE billows out from the damaged ship.  SEVERAL WOUNDED 	N.D. BAJORANS stumble out, coughing and hacking.					O'BRIEN				(to Guards)			Come on.	O'Brien and the Guards plunge into the airlock and go aboard 	the ship.         DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/11/94 - TEASER         4.2    CONTINUED:	Odo, Bashir, and the Nurse move to help the wounded.					ODO				(to wounded N.D.)			It's going to be all right...					NURSE				(to wounded N.D.)			I've got you.	Suddenly KAI WINN comes staggering out of the airlock, aided 	by another Bajoran.					BAJORAN			This way, Eminence.					BASHIR				(shocked)			Kai Winn... ?					WINN				(coughing)			The Vedek... take care of the Vedek...	Two N.D. Bajorans now ENTER from the airlock carrying someone 	between them.  Bashir rushes up to them and reacts in shock 	to what he sees.  Odo sees his reaction and looks at the 	wounded man -- it's a badly wounded VEDEK BAREIL.					ODO				(to com)			Odo to Kira.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Kira here.  									INTERCUT:2A   INT.

SISKO is standing nearby, and KIRA 	is pacing in the b.g.					SISKO			Chief O'Brien tells me that your 			ship suffered some kind of failure 			in the plasma relay.  You're lucky 			to be alive.					WINN			The Prophets must have decided that 			my work here is not yet complete.				(beat)			How is Bareil?					SISKO			Still in surgery.	Sisko and Kira exchange worried looks.        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/18/94 - ACT ONE         6.6    INT.

Bashir is checking 	equipment and making hands-on inspections of his patient.  	The mood is tense and urgent.					BASHIR			His heart rate is falling.				(to Nurse)			Fifty units inoprovaline.	The Nurse applies a hypospray to Bareil.					BASHIR				(off equipment)			Severe cerebral edema... with damage 			to the cerebral artery... and the 			neuroglial network.        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/18/94 - ACT ONE         7.6    CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(beat)			His vital signs are deteriorating 			too quickly, we can't wait any longer.				(to Nurse)			Prep him for surgery.	As they rush about and prepare Bareil for surgery...									CUT TO:7    INT. INFIRMARY	O'BRIEN ENTERS and hands Sisko a PADD.  Winn is sitting on 	the edge of the bed now as Kira looks on.					O'BRIEN			The report on the transport, sir.					SISKO			Give me the short version.					O'BRIEN			There was a molecular fracture in 			one of the warp plasma conduits.  It 			was only a matter of time until it 			gave way... once it collapsed the 			entire relay system exploded.					WINN			Was it sabotage?					O'BRIEN			I don't think so.					KIRA				(to Winn)			Why would you suspect sabotage?	Winn glances around.					WINN			I'd prefer to discuss that with the 			Emissary in private.        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/16/94 - ACT ONE         8.7    CONTINUED:	Kira looks to Sisko, who indicates he'll handle it.  He 	and Winn EXIT.									CUT TO:8    INT. SURGERY	They have now moved the clamshell operating device over 	Bareil.  Bashir and the Nurse are wearing gloves and are in 	the midst of surgery.  Another N.D.

COMMANDER'S OFFICE	Winn and Sisko are sitting at his desk.  Sisko hands her 	something to drink.					WINN			Vedek Bareil and I were on our way 			to a secret meeting with a member of 			the Cardassian Central Command.  It 			was my intention to open talks between 			Bajor and Cardassia which would lead 			to a treaty... and to a final peace 			settlement.	Sisko is shocked... he takes a beat to let this sink in.					SISKO			You have been negotiating peace... 			with Cardassia...					WINN			The Prophets teach us that while 			violence may keep an enemy at bay... 			only peace can make him a friend.					SISKO			How long has this been going on?					WINN			Bareil has been working to set up 			this meeting with Legate Turrel for 			the past five months.  They've 			discussed issues ranging from war 			reparations to an exchange of 			ambassadors.        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/11/94 - ACT ONE        10.8A   CONTINUED:					WINN (Cont'd)			They've even discussed the possibility 			of the Cardassians issuing a formal 			apology for the pain and suffering 			inflicted on the Bajoran people during 			the occupation.				(beat)			I was on my way to our first face-to-			face meeting with Turrel when we had 			the accident.	Sisko is genuinely surprised at this... it makes him look at 	Winn a little differently.					SISKO			Please don't take this the wrong 			way... but I never would've guessed 			that you would be the one to bring 			such a... bold vision of peace to 			Bajor.	Winn smiles at him, grateful for the praise as always... but 	her smile quickly fades.					WINN			A large share of the credit goes to 			Vedek Bareil.  Without him, the talks 			would've never come this far.					SISKO			It sounds like you've developed a 			deeper appreciation for Vedek Bareil.					WINN			I have to admit... he's been a very... 			loyal and trustworthy aide since the 			election.  I'm not sure I could've 			been as... forgiving if I'd been in 			his place.				(beat)			These talks were his idea... he's 			guided me through them... and without 			him in the future... the talks may 			never resume.									CUT TO:9    INT.

The radiation severely 			damaged his neural pathways.  I did 			everything I could.					KIRA				(quiet)			I know you did.  Did he ever regain 			consciousness?					BASHIR			No.  I don't think he suffered.	There are no tears in Kira's eyes.  She takes the news 	stoically, like a soldier hearing about the death of a buddy.					KIRA			Thank you, Doctor.				(beat)			I'm on duty in Ops.  Excuse me.	She heads for the door, but Bashir stops her.					BASHIR			Kira.					BASHIR				(quietly)			I think they can get along without 			you in Ops today.					KIRA			Maybe so.  But I need to be there.  			I appreciate your concern... but 			I'll grieve in my own way... in my 			own time.	Bashir looks at her for a beat, wants to reach out and help... 	but realizes this is how Kira wants to handle it.  He finally 	nods.  Kira turns and leaves.  OFF Bashir's face as he watches 	her go...10   OMITTED									CUT TO:        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/15/94 - ACT ONE        12.11   INT. SURGERY	Bareil is lying on the operating table, still covered by the 	clamshell.  There is a faint green LIGHT covering his entire 	body, indicating a stasis field is in operation.  The Nurse 	is standing nearby and a cart of medical instruments has 	been wheeled next to the table.  Bashir ENTERS, goes over to 	Bareil and looks down at him with a somber expression.					NURSE			We're ready to begin the autopsy, 			Doctor.	Bashir takes a long beat... pushes aside whatever personal 	feelings he may have... then gets down to business.					BASHIR			Release the stasis field.	The Nurse hits a control and the green light SHUTS OFF.					BASHIR				(to Nurse)			Let's begin with a neural scan.  I 			want to map his central axonal 			pathways and find out exactly where 			the breakdown began.	Bashir picks up a large device shaped like a helmet and places 	it on Bareil's head, completely covering his face.  The Nurse 	activates the device, and Bashir moves to a monitor.12   INCLUDE MONITOR (OPTICAL)	It shows a schematic diagram of Bareil's brain.  The schematic 	rotates and then zooms in, and we see a complex pattern of 	synapses, neurons and other medical data on Bareil's brain.					NURSE			Should I begin taking neural tissue 			samples?	Bashir nods and concentrates on the monitor.  In the b.g., 	the Nurse holds up Bareil's arm and prepares to take tissue 	samples.					BASHIR			Looks like the damage began in the 			parietal lobe... and spread through 			the rest of his brain in a retrograde 			manner.        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/16/94 - ACT ONE        13.12   CONTINUED:	Suddenly on the monitor, a PINPOINT OF LIGHT flashes on 	in Bareil's brain.  Bashir reacts.					BASHIR			Wait a minute... A neuron just fired 			in his cerebral cortex.	The Nurse places Bareil's arm back on the table and moves to 	Bashir.  And as she does so, another pinpoint of light appears 	in the brain schematic.					BASHIR			There it is again.	Bashir thinks... looks over at Bareil.  He moves over and 	touches Bareil's arm -- and as he does so, another pinpoint 	of light appears in his brain.					BASHIR			His nerves... his nerves are still 			transmitting electrical impulses to 			his brain...					NURSE			How can that be?  His brain activity 			level is zero.  His nervous system 			should be completely inactive.					BASHIR			I don't know... but it means that 			his body is still capable of sending 			messages to the brain... except the 			brain can't process those messages.        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/11/94 - ACT ONE        14.12   CONTINUED:	(2)	Bashir moves back to the monitor, studies it.					BASHIR			The radiation he was exposed to might 			have fortified his peripheral cell 			membranes...	Bashir works for a moment... then sees something on the 	monitor.					BASHIR			The radiation has also left a residual 			imprint of the original axonal 			pathways in his brain.	Bashir takes a couple of paces.  We can see his mind at 	work...					BASHIR			If we could regenerate his pathways 			using his own neuron cells... it 			might be possible to revive him...        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/16/94 - ACT ONE        15.12   CONTINUED:	(3)					NURSE			What about brain damage?  There's 			been no oxygen to his brain for almost 			forty minutes.					BASHIR			He was in stasis most of that time... 			that, combined with the strengthening 			of his cell membranes from the 			radiation might buy us the time we 			need...	As they work...								DISSOLVE TO:13   INT. SURGERY	A few hours later.  Bashir and the Nurse have their gloves 	on again.  Bareil's head is obscured by the clamshell, and 	they are clearly working on the brain itself with some medical 	equipment.  Bashir is glancing at the monitors as he works.					BASHIR			We need to repolarize his nerve cells 			with electrical impulses.  The spino-			thalamic tract will transmit that 			directly to the cerebral cortex.        DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - REV. 11/11/94 - ACT ONE        16.13   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			If the burst is the proper intensity, 			it might create a cascade effect 			within his brain.  The neurons might 			resume their normal firing patterns...	They both look at each other.  Bashir makes the decision.					BASHIR			Let's close up the cranial cavity.								DISSOLVE TO:14   INT. SURGERY	An hour later.  Bareil's head is covered with bandages.  	Bashir is placing small devices on Bareil's extremities.  	The Nurse is at a nearby console.  Bashir makes a final 	adjustment.					BASHIR			Neurogenic stimulators are in place... 			let's try a fifty millivolt burst.	The Nurse hits a control and Bareil's body stiffens ever so 	slightly.  Bashir looks at the Nurse, who looks at the 	console.  She shakes her head after a beat.					BASHIR			Increase to sixty.	She activates it again.  Bareil stiffens a little more.  The 	Nurse checks her console, shakes her head again.					BASHIR			Seventy.					NURSE			That's five millivolts above what 			normal tissue can withstand.  It'll 			burn out his cerebral cortex.					BASHIR			If I'm right... the inoprovaline 			drug I gave him should provide 			additional resistance against the 			excess electro-stimulation.           DEEP SPACE: "Life Support" - 11/10/94 - ACT ONE          17.14   CONTINUED:					BASHIR (Cont'd)				(beat)			Seventy.	The Nurse hits a few controls, and then Bareil stiffens 	rigidly.
