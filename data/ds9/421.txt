QUARK'S	The usual crowd.  ROM is pouring a tall one for MORN as a 	gleeful QUARK hurries over waving a Ferengi PADD.					QUARK			Rom, I have delightful news.  It's 			finally arrived.					ROM			It has?					QUARK			And I guarantee we're the only 			establishment in this sector to offer 			the entire cycle.					ROM			We are?  Why that's marvelous, isn't 			it, Morn?  Really... amazing.				(stares blankly at 				PADD)			What cycle?					QUARK			Idiot, don't you recognize profit 			when you see it?  You're looking at 			the latest Holosuite programs from 			Phalonia Prime.	That gets Morn's attention.  He casually tries to peer over 	Quark's shoulder to get a look at the PADD but is ignored by 	the Ferengi.					QUARK			Yes, when it comes to designing adult 			Holosuite programs, the Phalonians 			display true genius.				(beat)			If you don't believe me, take a peek 			at the image menu.	Quark leans over and taps a code into the PADD.  He and Rom 	crowd around it, blocking Morn's view (we never get to see 	the contents of the menu either).          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - TEASER           2.1    CONTINUED:					QUARK			Let's see, where to begin.  Ah, here 			we go, Scenario Fourteen-C, "A picnic 			with the Pleasure Goddess of Rixx."	Morn is determined to get a look at that Goddess.  But Quark 	pays no attention to him.					QUARK				(to Rom)			Now that's what I call a picnic.	Morn's heard enough.  He reaches over and grabs the PADD out 	of Quark's hands.  He stares at it and then at Quark, who 	finally takes notice of him.					QUARK				(to Morn, dryly)			I believe Holosuite Six is 			available.	Morn immediately gets up and heads for the stairs.  Quark 	watches him go, a satisfied smile on his face.					QUARK				(gloating)			That Morn, he always was a sucker 			for a Phalonian Holo-program.	He looks over to find Rom intently studying the discarded 	PADD.					QUARK				(continuing)			What do you think you're doing?					ROM			Nothing, brother.					QUARK			The story of your life.  Now get to 			work.	He yanks the PADD from Rom, who SCURRIES OFF.					QUARK				(calling after him)			If anyone wants me, I'll be in...				(checking PADD menu)			... Holosuite Three.	Quark makes a beeline for the stairs when he's stopped by..          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - TEASER           3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO (O.S.)			Quark!2    NEW ANGLE	as a testy ODO makes his way through the crowd.					QUARK			Not now, Odo.					ODO			We have to talk.					QUARK			It'll have to wait.					ODO			It can't wait.					QUARK				(exasperated)			Of course not.  Well make it fast.  			I have... business to attend to.					ODO			You remember that Subytt freighter 			we were discussing the other day?  			The one you claimed was smuggling 			defective isolinear rods to Bajor?					QUARK			Yes, yes, what about it?					ODO			Well, I conducted a little 			investigation of that freighter, and 			do you know what I discovered?	Quark smiles.  He senses where this is going.					QUARK			That I was telling the truth?	Odo frowns.  He hates to admit it.					ODO			That's right.  I arrested the first 			officer and two of the crew.					QUARK			Congratulations, Constable, I knew 			you could do it.  Now if you don't 			mind I'm needed upstairs.          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - TEASER           4.2    CONTINUED:	Quark tries to step around him, but Odo blocks his path.					ODO			Hold on, I'm not finished with you.					QUARK			Really, Odo, sometimes I think there's 			no pleasing you.  I help you crack a 			notorious smuggling ring, yet you 			still insist on treating me like an 			enemy.					ODO			You are my enemy.					QUARK			Then how do you explain my helping 			you?	Odo's body tenses, that's exactly what's been bothering him.					ODO			That's just it, I can't explain it.					QUARK			It's simple, really.  I figured we'd 			been at each others' throats long 			enough.  It's time we called a truce.					ODO			A truce?  You must be joking.					QUARK			Ask that Subytt First Officer if I'm 			joking.  From now on, you and I are 			going to be friends.	Odo stares suspiciously at Quark					ODO			You're up to something.					QUARK			Now why would you say that?					ODO			Because you're always up to something.          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - TEASER           5.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			I can see it's going to take time, 			but eventually you'll learn to trust 			me.					ODO			That'll be the day.	Odo LEAVES.  Rom, who's been listening, rejoins Quark.					QUARK				(very pleased with 				himself)			I don't think I can remember Odo 			looking quite so perplexed.					ROM			He's not alone.  Those Subytt 			smugglers were a potential source of 			great profit.					QUARK			Must I quote you the seventy-sixth 			Rule of Acquisition?					ROM				(searching his brain)			The seventy-sixth rule...					QUARK			"Every once in a while, declare 			peace."				(to Rom)			It confuses the hell out of your 			enemies.	Rom nods agreement, though he's not sure he understands that 	particular rule.3    NEW ANGLE	to include a FEMALE BOSLIC FREIGHTER CAPTAIN seated alone at 	a table by the stairs.					CAPTAIN			Hey Quark, how are your lobes?					QUARK			Tingling at the sight of you.	He sits down, distracted by her beauty.  All thoughts of 	Holosuite delights driven from his mind.  He notices her 	empty drink.          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - TEASER           6.3    CONTINUED:					QUARK			What will it be?  Another black hole?					CAPTAIN			Don't have the time.  Ship's about 			to pull out.  You know of anyone 			headed to Bajor?					QUARK			Ships go back and forth from there 			all the time.  Why?	The Captain holds up an elaborate Bajoran earring.					CAPTAIN			I promised someone I'd deliver this 			for them.  But it looks like I'm not 			going to make it there this trip.					QUARK			It's an earring.					CAPTAIN			I know it's an earring.  It was given 			to me by a maintenance worker on 			Cardassia Four.					QUARK				(interest piqued)			Are you saying a Cardassian gave you 			a Bajoran earring?					CAPTAIN				(nods)			He asked me to take it to Bajor.  			Said whoever I showed it to would 			understand.					QUARK				(wheels turning)			He said that?					CAPTAIN			Well, this is a Bajoran station, 			right?  There must be someone here 			who'll know what to do with it.					QUARK			Oh, there is.					CAPTAIN			Who?          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - TEASER           7.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			Me.	Quark plucks the earring out of her hands.  Gives a reassuring 	smile.4    INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS	KIRA, her tunic unbuttoned, stands before a Bajoran icon in 	silent meditation.  The DOORBELL CHIMES.					KIRA			Come in.	The door opens.  In steps Quark.					QUARK			Surprise.					KIRA			What do you want?	Quark's eyes are locked on her open tunic.					QUARK			I always wondered what your quarters 			looked like.	Kira buttons her tunic.					KIRA			That better not be your only reason 			for being here.	Quark scrutinizes her rather spartan living space.					QUARK			You don't entertain much, do you?					KIRA			I entertain a lot.  I just don't 			entertain you.	Quark indicates an adjoining room.  Kira disappears into 	another room.					QUARK			Let me guess, the bedroom.					KIRA (O.S.)			You take one step in here and I 			promise it'll be your last.          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - TEASER           8.4    CONTINUED:					QUARK			It could be worth it.					KIRA			You have five seconds to tell me 			what you want.					QUARK			Aren't you going to offer me a 			beverage?					KIRA			Five... four...					QUARK			Can we at least sit down?					KIRA			...three... two... one.	Kira comes out of the bedroom, moves toward Quark.  He backs 	away.					QUARK			Wait.	He holds up the earring.					QUARK			I brought you something...	Kira stops dead in her tracks, her eyes locked on the droplet.  	She slowly reaches out and takes it.					KIRA			Where did you get this?					QUARK			Is it valuable?	Kira grabs Quark by the collar.					KIRA				(urgent)			I said, where did you get it?					QUARK			From a Boslic Freighter Captain.  			She got it from a Cardassian.	She studies Quark, trying to decide if he's telling the truth.					KIRA			Where?          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - TEASER           9.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			On Cardassia Four.  That's what she 			told me anyway.				(re: the earring)			Consider it a gift.	She lets him go.  Then, her mind made up, she EXITS out the 	door.5    ON QUARK	Glad she's no longer in his face.  And surprised that she's 	left him alone in her quarters.  He steps over to a dresser 	and begins to casually rummage through a drawer.6    NEW ANGLE	as the front door opens and Kira strides in.  She grabs Quark 	by the back of the neck and drags him into the hall.  And 	the door closes on the now empty quarters we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - ACT ONE         10.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)7    INT.

And now you've come 			to the old man for advice on what to 			say to her.					JAKE			Dad...					SISKO			The main thing is you can't be afraid 			of rejection...					JAKE			Dad, I already asked her out.  And 			she said yes.					SISKO			She did, well that's wonderful.					JAKE			I was just wondering if you had any 			ideas what we could do.  I was kinda 			thinking of taking her to the 			Holosuites.	That stops Sisko in his tracks.					SISKO			The Holosuites?  I don't think so.					JAKE			Why not?					SISKO			Because you're too young to take a 			girl to the Holosuites.					JAKE			Okay, then how about if I bring her 			to our quarters?					SISKO			No, no quarters.          DEEP SPACE: "The Homecoming" - 07/02/93 - ACT ONE         12.8    CONTINUED:	(2)					JAKE			We're just going to talk.					SISKO			You can talk in public.					JAKE			It's not the same.					SISKO			You want to talk?				(pointing to the 				Promenade's second 				level)			Take her upstairs.

I already have.					KIRA			Then you don't want to know the 			answer.11   NEW ANGLE	Sisko and Kira cross to a table.
