PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL (OPTICAL)	SISKO and DAX stand at a viewport on the Second Level	along with a crowd of other station residents. They	watch as the wormhole opens, stays open for a beat,	then closes. No ship enters or exits the wormhole. To	the humans and other Federation personnel, this is an	interesting scientific anomaly, but to the Bajorans,	the wormhole's behavior has deep religious significance	and they react accordingly.					DAX			There it goes again. That's the			seventh time in the last two			hours.					SISKO			Still no idea what's causing it?					DAX			So far it seems to be opening and			closing completely at random. No			unusual readings... no ships			coming through...	They begin to walk away from the viewport. As they	walk, Dax occasionally glances over the rail down at	the Second Level.					DAX			For all we know, the Bajorans are			right. Maybe it is a message from			the Prophets.	As Sisko and Dax walk by a Bajoran monk, he bows his	head in respect to the Emissary. Sisko nods back	uncomfortably.					SISKO				(joking)			If it is, they haven't told me.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - TEASER           2.2    CONTINUED:					DAX			Maybe the Prophets don't recognize			you with the new beard.	Sisko smiles at Dax's jibe.					SISKO				(half to himself)			There has to be a scientific			explanation for this.	Dax continues looking over the railing. As she	watches...3    NEW ANGLE	ODO emerges from an airlock and stalks onto the	Promenade, looking a little ticked off.4    ON SISKO AND DAX	Dax reacts to the sight of Odo with a private smile.	Sisko picks up on it.					SISKO			Something funny, old man?					DAX				(playing innocent)			Hmmm? Oh, nothing.	Just then, Sisko's combadge chirps.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Ops to Captain Sisko.	Sisko hits his combadge.					SISKO			Sisko here.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Captain, we're receiving a			priority one message from			Starfleet Security.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - TEASER           3.4    CONTINUED:					SISKO			On our way.	Sisko and Dax EXIT.5    INT. QUARK'S	QUARK is behind the bar, telling MORN a joke.					QUARK			So then, the Andorian says "That's			not my antenna."	Morn stares at Quark blankly. Quark's obviously	disappointed at Morn's lack of response.					QUARK				(dismissing him)			Why do I bother?	Just then, there's an angry growl from off-screen.					ODO (O.S.)			Quark!	Quark turns to the door as Odo ENTERS, looking steamed.					QUARK			What can I do for you, Constable?					ODO				(to the point)			Dax. Where is she?	Quark looks around the bar.					QUARK			She's not here.				(innocently)			Is there anything else I can do			for you?	Odo believes that Quark knows more than he's letting	on.					ODO			You think this is all very funny,			don't you? You and Dax probably			planned it together.					QUARK			Planned what?           DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - TEASER            5    CONTINUED:					ODO			Moving my furniture.	Morn knows this is bad news and EXITS.					QUARK			Is that what this is all about?			Someone moved your furniture?					ODO			Not someone. Commander Dax. This			is the fourth time she's done it			in the past year. She breaks into			my quarters while I'm			regenerating, and moves all my			furniture out of alignment. She			shifts one piece three centimeters			to the left, and the next four			centimeters to the right. Not one			object in my quarters is where			it's supposed to be.					QUARK			And that's a bad thing?					ODO			Everything I own is carefully and			painstakingly arranged. Dax knows			that... yet she takes perverse			delight in throwing my quarters			into chaos.					QUARK			I would hardly call three			centimeters chaos.					ODO			Maybe you wouldn't... but I would.				(a beat)			You humanoids are all alike... you			have no sense of order. And Dax			is the most... humanoid person I			know.					SISKO'S COM VOICE			Sisko to Constable Odo.					ODO				(to com)			Odo here.					SISKO'S COM VOICE			Please report to Ops, immediately.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - TEASER           5.5    CONTINUED:	(2)	Odo would much rather rant to Quark a little while	longer, but duty calls.					ODO			Acknowledged.	Odo starts to leave.					QUARK				(calling after him)			If you see Dax, say hello to her			for me.	Odo ignores him and EXITS. And Odo leaves, Quark	breaks into a wide grin.6    INT. OPS	Odo ENTERS to find Sisko, KIRA, WORF and O'BRIEN	already there.					KIRA			How many people were at the			conference?					SISKO			Including the Tholian observer,			twenty-seven.					O'BRIEN				(shocked)			Twenty-seven. That's			unbelievable.					SISKO				(to Kira and Odo)			The Federation President, Jaresh-			Inyo has declared a planetwide			day of mourning.	Sisko sees Odo enter.					SISKO			Constable, take a seat.					ODO			Of course.	Odo takes a seat at the Ops table. Sisko nods to Worf.	Worf stands and activates the monitors behind the Ops	table.					WORF			We received this less than ten			minutes ago.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - TEASER           6.6    CONTINUED:					WORF (Cont'd)			It's a recording of a high level			diplomatic conference between the			Federation and the Romulan Empire			held on Earth a few days ago.				(to com)			Computer, begin replay at time			index five nine eleven.7    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	To include the viewscreen, which shows an M.O.S.	security recording of a conference room full of	Federation and Romulan diplomats. They're milling	around, talking in an informal session, when suddenly,	the room is irradiated by a high-tech weapon. The	viewscreen goes white and fritzes out as the recording	ends.8    CLOSE ON ODO	As he reacts to what he's seen.					ODO			A bomb.					WORF			Of unknown composition.					SISKO				(to Odo)			There hasn't been a crime like			this on Earth in over a hundred			years.					KIRA				(to Worf)			Go back. Show him what you showed			us.           DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - TEASER            8    CONTINUED:					WORF			Computer, restart at five nine			sixteen at one-tenth normal speed.9    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Back on the monitor which displays the diplomats,	moving in slow motion, seconds before the explosion.						WORF				(to com)			Freeze-picture. Enlarge section			F three and isolate.	A square on the monitor is isolated and enlarged. The	image is now a medium shot of three people, one Romulan	and two humans. They're standing in front of a small	pedestal holding a black Grecian vase.					WORF				(to Odo)			Keep your eye on the piece of			pottery.				(to com)			Resume at one-tenth speed.	The people in the picture start moving again. For a	split second, the Grecian vase can be seen beginning to	MORPH.					ODO			That's a changeling.	But before we or Odo can get a better look, the room	explodes and the recording ends.10   CLOSE ON ODO	As he reacts to what he's seen.11   NEW ANGLE	To include Sisko and Worf.					WORF			No sign of a changeling was found			in the aftermath. We must assume			that it escaped unharmed.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - TEASER           8.11   CONTINUED:					SISKO			I was hoping this would never			happen.

ODO'S QUARTERS	Dax finishes moving a piece of Odo's jungle-gym	furniture while Odo supervises.					DAX			How's that?	Odo studies the placement for a beat, then...					ODO			Another centimeter to the left.	Dax has been at this for a while and is obviously	getting tired of it.					DAX			Shouldn't you be on the Lakota?					ODO			The Lakota won't depart for Earth			for another hour. Which gives us			plenty of time to repair the			damage you've done to my room.				(a beat)			And while I'm gone, I want your			solemn word that you'll stay out			of my quarters.					DAX			You've got it.				(a beat)			So how long do you think you and			Captain Sisko will be on Earth?					ODO			I have no idea. I just hope this			trip isn't a waste of time. I'm			not sure what Captain Sisko and I			can tell Starfleet about my people			that hasn't already been in our			reports.					DAX			Believe me, Odo, with changelings			on Earth, Starfleet's going to			need all the help it can get.           DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 ACT ONE          10.12   CONTINUED:	She finishes moving the furniture.					DAX			There. How's that?					ODO			A little more to the left.					DAX				(playful)			Whatever you say, Constable.	Dax adjusts the furniture.13   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	Sisko is talking on a monitor to his father, JOSEPH	SISKO. Despite his advanced years, Joseph is as full	of life and energy as anyone you'd want to meet. He's	a gourmet cook who runs his own restaurant in New	Orleans, and his personality is as zesty and full-	bodied as his cooking. He's a big man with a big	personality to match.	Several years earlier Joseph fought a debilitating	battle against a severe illness, barely surviving.	He's never gotten back to full strength, but he's	determined to live out the rest of his years with	gusto. Unfortunately, the years are starting to run	out, a fact he's determined not to reveal to his son.					JOSEPH				(on monitor)			Wait until you see the size of the			eggplants I'm getting out of my			garden this year. As big as			crenshaw melons and twice as			heavy.					SISKO			How's Judith? She still helping			out at the restaurant?					JOSEPH				(on monitor)			I sent her home to Portland. Your			sister's got her own life to worry			about. Besides... she never puts			enough cayenne pepper in the			jambalaya.					SISKO			Just like mom.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT ONE            13   CONTINUED:					JOSEPH				(on monitor)			Which means she has no business			being in a kitchen.				(smiles)			It'll be good to have you home			again Benjamin. Jake, too.					SISKO			You know, Dad, this isn't exactly			a vacation. I'll be spending most			of my time in San Francisco at			Starfleet Headquarters.					JOSEPH				(on monitor)			Whatever you do during the day is			your business. But at dinner			time, you better get yourself down			to New Orleans. No son of mine is			going to eat that replicated slop			Starfleet calls food. Not if I			have anything to say about it.					SISKO			You won't get any argument from			me.	Sisko looks at his father with affection for a beat,	then a look of concern crosses his face.					SISKO			So... Dad... You feeling okay?					JOSEPH				(on monitor)			Let's not start that again.					SISKO			It's just a question.				(a beat)			You look a little tired. How's			the new aorta holding up?					JOSEPH				(on monitor)			The doctors say I'm a medical			marvel. At the rate things are			going in another year or two I			won't have an original organ left			in my body.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT ONE         12.13   CONTINUED:					SISKO			But you feel okay?					JOSEPH				(on monitor)			Just point me in the direction of			a party or a pretty girl and I'll			show you how good I feel.				(changing the subject)			Make sure to call me as soon as			you and Jake get here. The guest			rooms are always ready and waiting			for you.					SISKO			I know that, Dad. We'll be there			before you know it.	Joseph nods and terminates the transmission. Sisko	frowns. He doesn't completely believe his father's re-	assurances about his health. After a beat...14   NEW ANGLE	JAKE ENTERS.					SISKO			You just missed Grandpa Joe.					JAKE			Did you tell him we're staying in			San Francisco?					SISKO			I... didn't quite get around to			it.	Jake knows that means they're staying with Grandpa.					JAKE			Dad... You know if we stay with			Grandpa he's going to put me to			work in the kitchen.					SISKO			Is that so bad?					JAKE			Chopping vegetables for nine hours			a day isn't my idea of a vacation.					SISKO			Jake, you're not a kid anymore.			Grandpa won't expect you to chop			vegetables.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT ONE         13.14   CONTINUED:					SISKO (Cont'd)				(smiles)			He'll want you to wait tables.	Off Jake's resigned expression...14A  INT. QUARK'S	It's a normal crowd. People barely take notice as	O'Brien and BASHIR walk down the spiral staircase,	wearing World War Two-era R.A.F. uniforms, complete	with leather headgear, and in Bashir's case, a silk	pilot's scarf.					O'BRIEN				(to Quark)			Barkeep.	Quark rolls his eyes. He's been through this before	with these guys.					QUARK			So what can I get you two flyboys.					BASHIR			A scotch neat, and a pint o'			bitters for me mate.					O'BRIEN			And be quick about it. The			cabbage crates'll be coming back			over the briny any minute now.	Quark puts the glasses down.					QUARK			All right, all right. I'd hate to			let the "Jerries" strafe that			"green and pleasant land" of yours			while you two were taking time out			for a drink.					BASHIR			No choice. Ritual, you know.	He and O'Brien raise their glasses.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT ONE        13A.14A  CONTINUED:					0'BRIEN			To Clive. The best bloke ever to			prang his kite into the Channel.					BASHIR			Stiff upper lip.					O'BRIEN			Hear, hear.	They toast and drink.					QUARK			Now remember what I said about			throwing glasses.	They put the glasses down on the bar.					O'BRIEN				(to Bashir)			So, want to go back up and take			another crack at the Jerries?					BASHIR				(breaking character)			I don't know. To tell you the			truth, my heart's not in it.					QUARK			Aren't you taking Clive's death a			little seriously? After all, he			was just a holosuite character.					O'BRIEN			It's not Clive. It's Earth. You			probably wouldn't understand this,			Quark, but when you care about a			place, and it's in trouble... you			want to do something about it.			And when you can't, it's pretty			frustrating.					QUARK			I know exactly what you mean.			When the Great Monetary Collapse			hit Ferenginar, I was hundreds of			light years away, working as a			ship's cook on a long-haul			freighter. I can't tell you the			heartbreak I suffered, knowing			that rampant inflation and			currency devaluation were burning			like wildfires through the lush			financial landscapes of my home.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT ONE        13B.14A  CONTINUED:					QUARK (Cont'd)				(a beat)			It still depresses me even today.			I remember thinking my accounts			needed me, and there was nothing			I could do. I felt so... so			helpless.				(eager to bond)			So you see, I do understand.					O'BRIEN			Somehow, hearing that doesn't make			me feel the least bit better.					QUARK				(dismissive)			Humans. All you care about is			yourselves.	Quark moves off-screen, to deal with more amiable	customers. Just then, O'Brien and Bashir notice Odo	walking down the Promenade.					O'BRIEN				(calling out)			Odo, hold on a minute.	O'Brien and Bashir head for the door...14B  INT. PROMENADE	O'Brien and Bashir join Odo.					ODO				(re: the uniforms)			I take it the Battle of Britain			has been won yet again.					BASHIR			There's a spitfire with your name			on it sitting in the hangar. When			you come back from Earth, you can			take Clive's place in the			squadron.					ODO			Somehow, I doubt it.					O'BRIEN			Look, Odo... Do me a favor? If			you get a chance, drop by and			visit my folks in Killarney.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT ONE        13C.14B  CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)			You know, make sure they're doing			okay.					ODO			I'll try to find the time.					O'BRIEN			Good. I'll tell them you might			stop by.					ODO			Anyone you want me to look up,			Doctor?					BASHIR			No, that's all right. I just wish			I was going with you.					ODO			To be perfectly honest, Doctor, I			wish you were both going with me.			I could use the company. I doubt			a Shape-shifter is going to be very			popular on Earth at the moment.					O'BRIEN			No one can hold you responsible			for what your people are doing.					ODO				(skeptically)			Really.				(a beat)			I better get over to the Lakota.			We'll be leaving shortly.					BASHIR			Good luck.	O'Brien nods, seconding the motion.					ODO			I don't believe in luck.				(softens)			But I appreciate the sentiment.	Odo EXITS.					BASHIR				(worried)			Changelings on Earth.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT ONE        13D.14B  CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			It's times like this that home			seems a long way off.	Bashir nods.					BASHIR			Let's get out of these uniforms.	They EXIT.									CUT TO:15   OMITTED16   INT.

SISKO'S CREOLE KITCHEN - NIGHT	Sisko's is an upscale restaurant, but you might not	realize that from a first glance. Though there are	tablecloths and fresh flowers on the tables, the	overall mood is homey and comfortable. There are	pictures of old-time baseball players on the walls and	a stuffed alligator hanging from the ceiling. Patrons,	humans with a sprinkling of aliens, are dressed	casually and the service is friendly and unpretentious.	Joseph Sisko, who is circulating around the room, stops	to chat with one of the customers, who has just been	served a large trout in butter-lemon sauce.					JOSEPH			That is one beautiful fish. Seems			a shame to eat a trout that			pretty. Why, you should thank me			for the privilege of simply			looking at it.				(a beat)			Well, go on, take a bite. It			won't bite back.				(to all)			Now I don't want to see anyone			studying the dessert menu. If you			order anything but the bread			pudding souffle, you'll be making			a mistake you'll regret for the			rest of your lives.					SISKO (O.S.)			You should listen to him.

I'm fine. I'm			happy, I'm healthy, and I'm			planning on celebrating at least			fifty more birthdays. Satisfied?	Sisko's not satisfied, but he's not going to press it.					SISKO			Gumbo's as good as I remember.	Which is Sisko's way of backing off.					JOSEPH			Starfleet must be taking this			Shape-shifter thing pretty			seriously, to have you come all			the way back here.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT TWO         21.22   CONTINUED:					SISKO			It's serious, Dad.					JOSEPH			Twenty-seven people murdered right			here on Earth.				(shakes his head)			Never thought I'd see the day.				(brightens)			But now that my son's on the case,			I feel a lot better.	Before Sisko can respond to Joseph's comments, NOG	calls from off-screen.					NOG (O.S.)			Jake!	Everyone turns to see Nog, dressed in a Starfleet	cadet's uniform, approaching from the entrance to the	restaurant.					JAKE			Nog.	Jake gets up.

Jaresh-Inyo is a Grazerite,	a willowy, contemplative, humanoid alien only recently	elected to the office of President. Grazerites are	evolved from herbivorous herd animals and as such loathe	violence and confrontation. Sisko's carrying a twenty-fourth	century briefcase, which he places on the ground by his	chair.					LEYTON			Mister President, I'd like to			introduce Captain Sisko.					JARESH-INYO			Captain.

I understand the need for			increased security, but...				(referring to the PADD)			Blood screenings and phaser			sweeps?					SISKO			They've proven very effective on			Deep Space Nine.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT TWO         26.26   CONTINUED:					JARESH-INYO			I'm sure they have.

We have to take			precautions.					JARESH-INYO			Precautions may be advisable. But			I don't want to disrupt the lives			of the population.				(a beat)			Despite what happened at			Antwerp... I believe the			changeling threat is somewhat less			serious than Starfleet does.					LEYTON			Mister President, I assure you the			threat is real.					JARESH-INYO			For all we know, there was only			one changeling on Earth, and he			may not even be here anymore.					SISKO			But if he is here, we have a			problem. There's no telling how			much damage one changeling could			do.					JARESH-INYO			Forgive me for saying so, Captain,			but you sound a little...			paranoid.					SISKO			Do I?	Just then...27   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Sisko's briefcase MORPHS into Odo.

SISKO'S CREOLE KITCHEN - DAWN 	Jake has put candles out all over the restaurant for	light. Joseph is asleep in a booth, a tablecloth	wrapped around him as an impromptu blanket. Jake hears	a noise coming from outside the restaurant. He goes	and peeks out of the curtained windows. He looks both	surprised and disturbed by what he sees. He goes to	wake his grandfather.					JAKE			Grandpa, wake up.	Joseph opens his eyes.					JOSEPH			I wasn't sleeping. I was just			checking my eyelids for holes.	But Jake's not in a joking mood.					JAKE			You'd better come take a look at			this.	Joseph can tell that whatever Jake has seen, it's	serious. He gets up and goes to the window.					JOSEPH			Take a look at what?	Jake gestures to the window and Joseph looks outside.52   NEW ANGLE - JOSEPH'S P.O.V. (OPTICAL) 	Outside the window, in the early light of dawn, a group	of StarfIeet officers take up positions in the street,	looking grim and carrying phaser rifles.	As Joseph and Jake watch, another group of soldiers	beam in in the middle of the street. Earth is	preparing for war.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Homefront" - 11/04/95 - ACT FIVE           53   CLOSE ON JAKE AND JOSEPH	As they exchange a look, then...									FADE OUT.	SUPER:	TO BE CONTINUED                           END OF ACT FIVE                                                          THE END
