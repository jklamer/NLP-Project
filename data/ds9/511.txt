CAVES - REFUGEE CAMP - NIGHT	This is an underground Maquis camp in the DMZ. 	Conditions are crowded and primitive. Families are 	huddled together for warmth, children play in the 	rubble, people distribute food, others tend small 	cooking fires, while still others lie sick or wounded 	on the cold cave floors. We should get the feeling 	that this camp has been set up for some time.2    ON THE CAVE ENTRANCE	where a silhouetted figure pauses in the entryway and 	looks around. A few refugees glance up at him for a 	moment and then continue about their business. The 	figure steps out of the backlight, revealing his 	features for the first time. It's CAPTAIN SISKO, 	wearing the tattered clothes of another "refugee." 	He glances around the cave, as he walks through the 	chamber, taking in the pathetic sights and sounds of 	these humans and their living conditions.	Sisko is looking for someone, scanning the faces, then 	spotting something off screen, he moves towards an OLD 	MAN working a twenty-fourth century equivalent of an 	arc welder, welding a section of a broken-down 	replicator. The light from the welder FLASHES on his 	face, revealing a distinctive scar running the length 	of his cheek. Sisko approaches him.					SISKO			I'm looking for a friend of 			mine.	The Old Man keeps working without even glancing up at	Sisko.					SISKO			His name is Cing'ta.	On the mention of that name, the Old Man finally looks 	up at Sisko, seeming to size him up. Sisko returns the 	look. After a beat, the Old Man points to a curtain, 	drawn to cover the entrance to another chamber. The 	Old Man returns his attention to his work.	Sisko crosses the room.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Uniform" - REV. 11/26/96 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:	Then, making sure that no one has followed him or even 	taken notice of him, Sisko steps through the curtain.3    INT. CAVES - INNER CHAMBER	Sisko steps into the dark room, looks around. No one 	seems to be there.					SISKO			Cing'ta?	Sisko senses that something's not quite right. He 	takes a few steps into the room and then, slowly, 	trying not to draw attention to what he's doing, slips 	a hand into his coat pocket. But before he can pull 	out his phaser, the wrong end of a disruptor is pressed 	against his head.	Sisko freezes. And then a familiar voice:					MAN'S VOICE			Throw it on the ground.	Sisko does as he's told. The disruptor is eased away 	from his head, but its aim is never altered.					MAN'S VOICE			Turn around.	Sisko turns to come face-to-face with MICHAEL 	EDDINGTON, the erstwhile lieutenant commander and 	Starfleet security chief on Deep Space Nine.					EDDINGTON			Hello, captain.	Sisko stiffens at the sight of his former officer.					SISKO			Eddington.					EDDINGTON			Mister Cing'ta won't be joining			us.					SISKO			Is he dead?					EDDINGTON			You just don't understand the			Maquis, do you Captain?					(MORE)       DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Uniform" - REV. 11/26/96 - TEASER        3.3    CONTINUED:					EDDINGTON (Cont'd)			We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta 			has been marooned on a 			particularly nasty planet in the 			Badlands, but I assure you -- he's 			very much alive.					SISKO			How merciful. You condemned him 			to a slow death.					EDDINGTON			It's more than he deserved. He 			was going to sell us out to you.			He betrayed us.					SISKO			There's a subject you know a lot 			about.					EDDINGTON			You've been on my tail for eight 			months and now that we're face-to-			face -- that's all you have to say 			to me?					SISKO			I'll say the rest at your court-			martial.					EDDINGTON			Tell me, captain... what is it 			that bothers you more -- the fact 			that I left Starfleet to fight for 			a higher cause, or that it 			happened on your watch?					SISKO			You didn't "leave" Starfleet. If 			you had, I wouldn't be here. You 			"betrayed" Starfleet... you used 			your position as security chief to 			feed the Maquis information about 			us. And at the same time, you 			misled us with false information 			about them. There's a word for 			that... treason.	Eddington's eyes harden... there's a lot of tension 	between these two men. Eddington indicates the curtain 	with his disruptor.	Sisko stares at him for a moment -- long enough to make 	the point that he's not at all intimidated by 	Eddington. Then slowly, and deliberately, walks over 	to the curtain.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Uniform" - REV. 11/26/96 - TEASER       3A.3    CONTINUED: (2)					EDDINGTON			Look out there.	Sisko pulls the curtain.4    SISKO'S POV	of the first chamber, where he sees the refugees going 	about their sad existence.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Uniform" - REV. 11/26/96 - TEASER        4.5    INTERCUT WITH.					EDDINGTON			Those people... they used to be 			colonists on Salva Two. They had 			farms and shops and homes and 			schools... and then one day, the 			Federation signed a treaty and 			handed their world over to the 			Cardassians.				(snapping his fingers)			Just like that... they made these 			people refugees overnight.					SISKO			It's not that simple and you know 			it. These people don't have to 			live here like this. We've 			offered to resettle them.					EDDINGTON			They don't want to be resettled -- 			they want to go home to the lives 			they built. How would you feel if 			the Federation gave your father's 			home to the Cardassians? Think 			he'd like to be "resettled?"					SISKO				(turning to face 				Eddington)			I'm not here to debate Federation 			policy with --					EDDINGTON				(snapping)			I didn't tell you to turn around.	Sisko swallows his anger for a moment and turns back to 	look at the refugee camp.					EDDINGTON			Look at them, captain. They're 			humans. Just like you and me. 			And Starfleet took everything away 			from them. Remember that the next 			time you put on that uniform. 			There's a war out here and you're 			on the wrong side.	Sisko takes that in for a beat.					SISKO			You know what I see out there, 			Mister Eddington? I see 			victims...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Uniform" - REV. 11/26/96 - TEASER        5.5    CONTINUED:					SISKO (Cont'd)			... but not of Cardassia or the 			Federation. Victims of you. The 			Maquis. You've sold these people 			the dream that one day, they can 			go back to those farms and homes 			and schools -- but you know they 			never can.	Sisko turns around, faces him directly.					SISKO				(continuing)			And the longer you keep that hope 			alive, the longer they're going to 			suffer.	Eddington glares at him, raising the gun directly to 	his face.					SISKO			Go ahead, shoot me.	But Eddington has no such plans. He relaxes his aim.					EDDINGTON			Someday, I may take you up on 			that. For now, let me leave you 			with one piece of advice... don't 			come after me... you'll regret it.	Eddington smiles for the first time; then pulls out a 	small control device, taps a key and DEMATERIALIZES.	The second he's gone, Sisko reaches inside his coat, 	taps his combadge.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "...

The sad part is you 			don't even realize it...				(a beat)			I feel sorry for you, captain. 			This obsession with me -- look 			what it's cost you.	Sisko acts like Eddington stabbed him in the heart, but 	in truth, Sisko's drawing Eddington in.					SISKO				(to Kira, feigning				anger)			Major -- Shut that thing off.				(to Worf)			Prepare to launch torpedoes.					EDDINGTON			Wait!      DEEP SPACE NINE: "...

I'll give you 			what you want...	Eddington takes a deep breath, and prepares himself to 	make the ultimate sacrifice. A hero's final grand 	gesture...				EDDINGTON			Me.	Sisko nods to Kira and the image of Eddington 	DISAPPEARS. The second it does, Sisko leans back and 	lets out a big SIGH of relief.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "... Uniform" - REV. 11/26/96 - ACT FIVE     62.70   EXT.

The Cardassian and 			Maquis colonists who were forced 			to abandon their homes will make 			new lives for themselves on the			planets their counterparts evacuated.71   INT. DOCKING RING - AIRLOCK	Odo awaits as the airlock OPENS, revealing Sisko and	Dax and allowing them to emerge.					SISKO (V.O.)				(continuing)			The balance in the region will be 			restored, though the situation 			remains far from stable.					ODO			Captain. Commander. Welcome 			home.					SISKO			It's good to be back.					ODO			I understand your trip was... 			productive.	Without answering, Sisko turns back to face the 	airlock; he wants to see the SECURITY DETAIL escorting 	Eddington.72   NEW ANGLE	as Eddington and Sisko exchange a long, silent stare. 	A stare which is finally broken by Sisko.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "...
