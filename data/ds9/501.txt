HABITAT RING CORRIDOR	BASHIR is walking down the Corridor when he passes the 	door to O'Brien's quarters. We can hear barely audible 	SHOUTS coming from inside -- a man's voice and a 	woman's voice -- but too faintly to make out anything 	they're saying. Bashir stops, tries to listen, but 	can't. He glances quickly around. No one. He moves 	closer to the door and cocks his head closer to the 	door. At that moment, QUARK comes down the hall in the 	b.g. and stops as he sees Bashir.					QUARK			Doctor?	Bashir starts a bit, then puts a hand to his neck as if 	massaging it.					BASHIR				(covering)			Quark. Hello.					QUARK			Let me guess: eavesdropping on			the battling O'Briens?					BASHIR			Don't be ridiculous.	Quark cocks his head and listens to the shouting.					QUARK				(listening)			Such language. I hope Molly isn't			around.					BASHIR			You can hear what they're saying?					QUARK				(re: his ears)			How could I not?					BASHIR			What are they saying?	Quark steers Bashir a few steps away from the door and 	down the hall.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ...

Hello.					KEIKO			Quark.					QUARK				(not surprised)			Mrs. O'Brien.	Keiko passes them and EXITS to her quarters.					BASHIR			I thought you said the O'Briens 			were arguing in there.					QUARK			Not Miles and Keiko -- the other 			O'Briens -- Miles and Kira.					BASHIR			What do they have to argue about?					QUARK			Miles hid Kira's springball racket 			because she's carrying his baby, 			and he doesn't want her taking 			risks, and she doesn't want him 			controlling her life.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ...

Now they're 			in the "let's talk this out and 			share our feelings" part of the 			fight. Show's over.	Bashir tries to cover his own disappointment.					BASHIR 			Oh. Well. Good.					QUARK 			If I happen to walk by here 			later... and I happen to hear 			anything...					BASHIR 			Call me.	They head off in separate directions.										CUT TO:2    INT. REPLIMAT	WORF and DAX are having drinks at one of the tables. 	Mid-conversation.					WORF			It is the power of his voice... 			the strength of his intonations 			that makes Barak-kadan a great 			singer. There are none like him.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ... " - REV. 08/08/96 - TEASER       4.2    CONTINUED:					DAX			None as boring anyway. He never 			varies his performance by even a 			half-tone.					WORF			I prefer traditional opera 			performed in the traditional			manner.					DAX			You know, for a Klingon who was 			raised by humans, wears a 			Starfleet uniform, and drinks 			prune juice, you're pretty 			attached to "tradition." 				(beat)			But that's okay. I like men who 			are riddled with contradictions.	She gives him a flirtatious smile and Worf rolls his 	eyes and looks away. Worf suddenly sees something 	which literally makes his jaw drop open.3    WORF'S POV	A group of Klingons are ENTERING the Promenade from the 	Airlock: GRILKA and TUMEK, who were both established in 	"House of Quark," and THOPOK, a powerfully built 	Klingon warrior in his prime. Grilka is definitely in 	charge here and the others are members of her entourage.4    RESUME WORF & DAX	Worf turns in his seat as the Klingons head off down 	the Promenade. He's just been hit with the Klingon 	equivalent of a thunderbolt. To Worf, Grilka may well 	be the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ... " - REV. 08/08/96 - TEASER       5.4    CONTINUED:	Dax follows his gaze and sees the Klingons as they walk 	away.					DAX			Well, that's a welcome sight. The 			peace talks must be going well if 			Klingons are visiting the station 			again.	She notices the look on his face.					DAX			Worf?	He turns back around with an excited expression.					WORF			Did you see her?					DAX			The Klingon woman?					WORF			She was... glorious.	Before Dax can pursue this any further, Worf is up and 	heading out onto the Promenade to follow the Klingons. 	After a beat, Dax follows him.5    INT. PROMENADE	Worf is moving through the crowd, but he's momentarily 	lost sight of the Klingons. Finally, he spots the last 	member of the entourage EXITING to Quark's. Worf moves 	to the window and looks inside, careful not to draw 	attention to himself.6    WORF'S POV	Grilka seats herself at a table, Tumek remains standing 	and Thopok sits nearby. Grilka looks regal, confident 	and desirable... a woman in command of her own destiny 	and comfortable with her position.7    RESUME WORF	As Dax catches up with him and looks through the window 	at Grilka.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ... " - REV. 08/08/96 - TEASER       6.7    CONTINUED:					DAX				(re: Grilka)			Her? She's okay.					WORF			I have never seen such a woman. 			Who is she? What house is she 			from? I do not recognize her 			family crest...	He trails off as Grilka suddenly stands and smiles at 	someone in the bar with open arms. Dax and Worf shift 	their positions to see who she's greeting so warmly. 	It's Quark and he's happy to see Grilka too.					WORF			She's a friend of the Ferengi.	But Worf's disgust turns to stunned surprise when 	Grilka not only embraces Quark, but gives him a genuine 	kiss, which Quark is only too happy to return. This 	jogs Dax's memory.					DAX			Now I remember who she is. Her 			name's Grilka. And she's not just 			Quark's friend... she's his ex-wife.	Off Worf's face as he reacts to this news...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking...

QUARK'S	A few minutes later. Quark and Grilka are sitting at 	her table, while Tumek stands patiently nearby. Thopok 	is at an adjacent table, watching the crowd warily for 	any threats and occasionally giving Quark a 	contemptuous look. Quark is pouring Grilka a drink, 	and they are obviously at ease with one another. In 	fact, there are some sparks between these two -- some 	chemistry that they're both aware of and that they 	might consider acting on.					QUARK 			Maparian ale...				(drops in a mixer)			... with a hint of Pazafer as I 			recall.					GRILKA			You remember. I'm honored.					QUARK 			How could I forget? You're the 			only Klingon I know who drinks 			something besides bloodwine or 			prune juice.					GRILKA			Prune juice?					QUARK 			Forget it.				(raises a glass of his				own)			To the House of Grilka. May it 			continue to be as strong and proud 			as its Lady is beautiful.	Grilka smiles, touched by the sentiment and they clink 	glasses. Grilka sips her drink and reacts with 	pleasure.					GRILKA				(re: drink)			You may not have been the ideal 			husband... but you are an 			excellent bartender.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ... " - REV. 08/08/96 - ACT ONE      8.8    CONTINUED:					QUARK 			I know of no greater compliment. 				(beat)			So what brings you to my humble 			establishment? Business or 			pleasure?	Grilka glances up at him and then pauses... she doesn't 	answer him directly for some reason.					GRILKA			The recent hostilities between the 			Empire and the Federation have 			been... very costly to my family. 			We've suffered great losses in 			ships, lands, warriors...					QUARK 			War -- what's it good for? That's 			what I always say. Absolutely 			nothing.					GRILKA			The financial cost was... 			significant.	Grilka looks away for a moment and Quark begins to 	realize that this is the reason she's come to his bar. 	But he knows that Grilka isn't going to ask for his 	help, so he steers the conversation so she doesn't have 	to.					QUARK 			I see. But financial matters 			are... the last thing on your 			mind. As a Klingon, you're far 			more interested in honor and 			glory, than in something as 			mundane as... money.					GRILKA			You understand us so well.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ... " - REV. 08/08/96 - ACT ONE      9.8    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK 			I'm a very understanding man.	There's a beat, and then Quark pretends to suddenly get 	a new thought.					QUARK 			I've got an idea: why don't I take 			a look at your financial records? 			I know that's not why you're here -- 			I'm sure this is simply a social 			visit -- but maybe I could help.					GRILKA			The money is of little 			consequence.					QUARK 			I'm sure it is to you... but as a 			Ferengi businessman, it's hard for 			me to forget about such things. 			I'd really like to help.					GRILKA			Perhaps...					QUARK				(smiling, but he means 				it)			I won't ask again.					GRILKA			Very well. If it pleases you, 			I'll allow you access to the 			records.					QUARK 			Thank you.	He puts a hand on her thigh.					QUARK				(suggestive)			We'll talk about my "fee" later.	Grilka notices the hand, and then looks up at Quark. 	But instead of reacting with a threat, she gives him a 	look that might just be an invitation.					GRILKA			Yes. We will.	Quark is surprised, but Grilka just smiles and then 	stands and heads for the EXIT. Tumek goes with her, 	but Thopok lags behind. Just as Quark is savoring the 	possibilities inherent in Grilka's answer, Thopok 	shoves him back in his seat and glares into his face.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ... " - REV. 08/08/96 - ACT ONE     10.8    CONTINUED:	(3)					THOPOK			Hear this, Ferengi. Help Grilka 			and you will live. Fail and I 			will kill you myself.					QUARK				(unfazed)			Should I write that down? No, I 			think I can remember it. Thank 			you.	Thopok doesn't appreciate Quark's humor. He lets go of 	Quark and then stalks out of the bar, leaving Quark 	with something to think about.									CUT TO:9    INT. OPS	Worf and Dax are riding the turbolift into Ops. Worf 	is still dealing with his shock as Dax explains the 	Grilka/Quark backstory.					DAX			... and even though it was an 			accident, Quark took the credit 			for killing Grilka's husband.					WORF			Why?					DAX			As a way of boosting business at 			the bar. And it worked. But then 			Grilka kidnapped Quark, took him 			back to the Klingon Homeworld and 			married him.					WORF			Why!!?					DAX			I'm getting to that. As a woman, 			Grilka was forbidden to lead her 			House. So, by marrying Quark she 			was able to retain control through 			him.	Worf understands the reasoning, but doesn't like it. 	He glares at his console and punches a few buttons.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking... " - REV. 08/08/96 - ACT ONE         9    CONTINUED:					DAX				(continuing)			Eventually, Grilka convinced the 			Council to give her control and 			she divorced Quark on the spot. 			As far as I know, that was the 			last time they saw each other.					WORF			Then it was a marriage of 			convenience?					DAX			Certainly for Grilka. I'm not 			sure how convenient it was for 			Quark.					WORF			His opinion is of no consequence. 			He is unworthy of such a prize as 			she.	Dax leans on a console and looks at Worf with an amused 	expression.					DAX			Worf... you sound like you've got 			a bad case of par'Mach.					SISKO'S VOICE			Is that contagious?	They look up as SISKO walks over with a PADD. Worf 	looks instantly uncomfortable and moves off to busy 	himself with work.					DAX				(to Sisko)			Par'Mach is the Klingon word for 			love, but with more... aggressive 			overtones.					SISKO 			Love? Worf?					DAX			Stranger things have happened.					SISKO 			Especially around here.	They both look at Worf as he works at a console.									CUT TO:       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking...

INFIRMARY	Bashir is assembling a small respirator-type device 	while O'BRIEN looks on.					BASHIR 			This should alleviate Kira's 			sneezing...					O'BRIEN			Should?					BASHIR 			Bajoran women have sneezed their 			way through pregnancy for a 			hundred thousand years. You can't 			expect me to cure it overnight.	He hands the device to O'Brien, who looks it over.	Bashir then moves to a large container of PILLS and 	begins tapping them into a small bottle. O'Brien 	continues to toy with the device throughout the scene.					BASHIR 			You know, I heard a rumor that the 			Jerries might be coming over the 			Channel tonight. Should we have 			a little surprise waiting for them?	O'Brien takes a sniff from the respirator and 	immediately sneezes.					BASHIR			Serves you right.					O'BRIEN				(rubbing his nose)			I can't go to the holosuite 			tonight. Kira and I have to work 			some things out.					BASHIR 			Still fighting, eh?					O'BRIEN			Who said we were fighting?	Bashir has to cover quickly, not wanting to admit 	he was eavesdropping.					BASHIR 			Word gets around. It's a small 			station.					O'BRIEN			It's a huge station.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ...

Bajoran takeo 			herbs for Kira's swollen ankles. 			She'll need to dissolve these in 			some kind of fruit juice before 			ingesting them.	O'Brien opens the bottle and taps out a couple of pills 	into his palm.					O'BRIEN			I hope these taste better than 			those makara herbs.					BASHIR 			Are you sampling all her 			medications?	O'Brien gives him a look.					O'BRIEN			Kira didn't like the taste. 				(beat)			Oh, and I almost forgot -- she has 			a rash on the back of her thighs.			Do you have some kind of salve?	Bashir moves to a shelf to get some ointment.					BASHIR 			How long's she had it?					O'BRIEN			I noticed it yesterday when I was 			helping her out of the tub... so 			at least a day.	Bashir hands him the salve and cocks an eyebrow.					BASHIR			"Helping her out of the tub?"						O'BRIEN			She's living with me and she's 			having my baby.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ...

As 	he watches, Quark says something to Grilka, then picks 	up two of the PADDS, and EXITS toward the back. Grilka 	takes a pull from her drink.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ...

Kira and O'Brien are 	trying to act normal, which of course means that 	they're a little abnormal as a result.					KIRA			Hi.					KEIKO			Hi. Sit down. You look 			exhausted.

Dax makes a quick, slashing attack, 	and Quark easily parries it, then begins an attack of 	his own.35   WORF	Is standing off to one side, holding a bat'leth of his 	own and fighting an invisible opponent. He is wearing 	a VIRTUAL CONTROL DEVICE that is attached to the base 	of his neck and has two thin wands that project out in 	front of his face, with special tips that point 	directly into his eyes.	Quark's actions precisely mimic those of Worf and we 	can now see that Worf is actually controlling Quark's 	body. The device allows Worf to see through Quark's 	eyes and lets him fight Dax through Quark. This odd 	fight continues until Quark disarms Dax and puts his 	bat'leth to her chest. Dax bows her head in defeat and 	then looks up with a smile.					DAX				(to Quark)			Congratulations.	Quark and Worf put their weapons away with a flourish.	Worf reaches around and taps a control on his device (Quark 	mimics this action too) and then they're disconnected from 	each other.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking ...

People come in and 			I'll treat them, that's all.				(beat)			Have a seat in the Surgery. 			I'll... be with you in a minute.	Worf and Dax EXIT to...57   INT. SURGERY - CONTINUOUS	Dax and Worf ENTER and Dax helps Worf ease onto the 	edge of the biobed. Dax smiles at him and at first he 	smiles back... then frowns as he begins to contemplate 	the future.					WORF			You realize that... according to 			Klingon tradition...					DAX			According to tradition, we have to 			get married.					WORF			But as you keep insisting, you are 			not a traditional woman.					DAX			And the truth is, Worf... at 			heart, you're not much of a 			traditional man.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking... " - REV. 08/08/96 - ACT FIVE      61.57   CONTINUED:					WORF			You may be right... 				(beat)			How... do you wish to proceed?					DAX			I don't know.					WORF			You must have some idea. You were 			the...					DAX			Aggressor?					WORF			Yes. And now there are many 			questions that must be answered.					DAX			I don't feel like answering 			questions. Why don't we just take 			it one day at a time and see what 			happens.					WORF			I do not like the... uncertainty 			of that arrangement.					DAX			Well, one thing's for certain... 				(beat)			You've stopped thinking about 			Grilka.	She looks at him and he looks at her for a moment. 	Then Dax smiles and Worf finally lets out a genuine 	burst of LAUGHTER.58   INT. INFIRMARY	Where Bashir is working on Quark. They both react to 	the sound of Worf's o.s. laughter.					BASHIR			Is he... laughing?					QUARK			I didn't think he knew how.	Bashir moves away for another medical instrument.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Looking... " - REV. 08/08/96 - ACT FIVE      62.58   CONTINUED:					GRILKA			I will take my leave now, Quark. 			Thank you for your... financial 			advice.					QUARK			My pleasure. I hope it was worth 			the trip. 					GRILKA			The trip... had its own rewards.	They smile at each other for a moment, savoring the 	memory.					QUARK			Will I see you again? 					GRILKA			I'll be back.					QUARK			Don't come back too soon. I need 			time to heal.	She looks at him for a beat, then cuts loose with her 	own LAUGHTER. Quark starts laughing too, but carefully 	because of his injuries. Bashir reacts, then another 	Klingon LAUGH echoes out of Surgery, this time with 	Dax's laughter providing a melodic counterpoint. 	Bashir stands there trapped between two rooms of mirth 	that he'd rather not think about.					BASHIR 			There're days I really hate this 			job.59   EXT.
