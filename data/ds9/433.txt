SPACE - T'LANI MUNITIONS CRUISER (OPTICAL)	The Runabout Ganges and a much larger T'Lani Munitions Ship 	are in synchronous orbit around a small planet, T'Lani Three.					BASHIR (V.O.)			Chief Medical Officer's log, Stardate 			47529.4.  For the past week Chief 			O'Brien and I have been helping 			scientists from the Kellerun and 			T'Lani races find a way to eliminate 			their stockpile of Harvesters... a 			deadly biomechanical gene disrupter 			used by both sides in their centuries-			long war...2    INT. T'LANI MUNITIONS CRUISER - LAB	BASHIR hovers over a TRANSPARENT HALF-DOME filled with a 	pale green liquid -- a genetic bath.  He's surrounded by a 	joint team of T'Lani and Kellerun scientists.  (In looks 	only, the T'Lani should be to the Kelleruns like the Vulcans 	are to the Klingons... the T'Lani look like the more peaceful 	race.)  A T'Lani scientist named NYDROM is among the group; 	he wears the loose-fitting, colorful garb common to all the 	T'Lani we will see.	In another part of the room, O'BRIEN sits working at a 	monitor.  He pauses to sip from a MUG OF COFFEE, which he 	sets down next to him.  O'Brien, Bashir and the others appear 	to have been working around the clock for the past week.  	Everyone seems tired but determined.  (NOTE:  A transporter 	pad and panel should inconspicuously be part of this lab.)					BASHIR			Doctor Nydrom, how's our muon charge?	Nydrom moves to a circuit control station, which is off to 	the side of the room.  He checks the readings.					NYDROM			Coming up to full power.          DEEP SPACE: "Armageddon Game" - 11/08/93 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:	Bashir then nods to an N.D. Kellerun scientist.  The 	scientist picks up a glass canister of Harvesters -- a DAY-	GLO ORANGE GEL.  The scientist carefully fastens the canister 	onto the top of the domed genetic bath.					BASHIR				(to computer)			Computer... this is Harvester test 			sequence three hundred and seventy-			five.					NYDROM				(still at control 				station)			Muon generator now at full power.	Bashir looks down at the genetic bath control panel, stares 	at it along with the other scientists.  O'Brien turns toward 	them in his chair, aware of how important the next few moments 	will be.					BASHIR				(wearily)			Once more into the breech... I hope 			this works, because frankly I'm 			running out of ideas.					NYDROM			It took ten years to perfect the 			Harvesters.  We've only been trying 			to eliminate them for a week.					BASHIR			Is that all it's been?  It feels 			like we've been working nonstop for 			a month.  I've never seen a nano-			biogenic weapon so resistant to broad 			spectrum radiation...          DEEP SPACE: "Armageddon Game" - 11/08/93 - TEASER          3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR				(eyeing muon bath; 				thinking  out loud)			It's all a matter of finding the 			right combination of muon 			frequencies...				(beat; to Nydrom)			It should be simple... but it's 			not...					O'BRIEN				(letting out some 				tension)			Doctor, start the sequence... or 			we will be here a month.					BASHIR			Right, Chief.				(announcing)			I'm introducing the Harvesters into 			the genetic bath...3    CLOSE ON GENETIC BATH	The orange Harvester canister is lowered into the bath.					BASHIR (V.O.)			Beginning muon influx now...	BLUE MUON RAYS begin crackling throughout the genetic bath... 	after a long beat, the canister rises back up.  The gel inside 	has been changed from a fiery orange to a placid green.4    RESUME SCENE	Bashir and the others are quietly stunned.					BASHIR				(softly; to Nydrom)			Doctor, would you please check for 			any gene-disrupter phasing...	Nydrom moves back to the circuit control station, checks the 	readings.					NYDROM			The genetic integrity of the sample 			is holding steady.  I'm not reading 			any genetic disruption at all.       DEEP SPACE: "Armageddon Game" - REV. 11/09/93 - TEASER        4.4    CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(quietly hopeful)			Are you sure?  Run the sequence 			again...					NYDROM				(works panel; rechecks 				readings)			The results are identical...					O'BRIEN				(wondering)			What?  Did it work?				(beat)			Somebody say something... !					BASHIR				(grinning)			It worked all right...					NYDROM				(victorious smile)			The Harvesters have been destroyed.	A beat.  Smiles all around, weariness giving way to triumph.  	Nydrom slaps Bashir on the back; the Kellerun and T'Lani 	scientists congratulate each other.  Bashir turns to O'Brien, 	who gives him a "well-done" smile.	Amidst the celebration, the Kellerun Ambassador, SHARAT, 	ENTERS the room.  An elderly wisp of a man with long black 	hair, he calmly observes the others.					SHARAT			Good news, I take it...					NYDROM				(a bit formally)			Ambassador Sharat.  I'm pleased to 			inform you that we've found a way to 			eliminate the Harvesters...	Sharat smiles, begins shaking hands with all the scientists, 	Kelleruns and T'Lani alike...					SHARAT			Excellent.  Well done.  I knew if 			our people stopped killing each other 			and worked together, we'd put an end 			to these horrible weapons... this is 			a symbol of the new future we have 			embarked upon...          DEEP SPACE: "Armageddon Game" - REV. 11/09/93 - TEASER       4A.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					NYDROM			Yes.  And let's not forget, we never 			could have done this without the 			help of our friends from the 			Federation...					SHARAT				(to Bashir and O'Brien)			At first we had questioned Doctor 			Nydrom's decision to bring in outside 			help.  But obviously it was the right 			thing to do.  We're all grateful for 			your assistance.					BASHIR				(modestly)			It was our pleasure, I assure you.          DEEP SPACE: "Armageddon Game" - 11/08/93 - TEASER          5.4    CONTINUED:	(3)					SHARAT				(to Nydrom)			But eliminating the Harvesters is 			only half the task.  We must make 			certain that all scientific data 			concerning them is wiped out as well.	Nydrom and Bashir look to O'Brien...					O'BRIEN				(confirming)			I've purged every file in the T'Lani 			and Kellerun data banks pertaining 			to the Harvesters.  If anyone gets 			it in their head to build these things 			again, they'll have to start from 			scratch.					NYDROM			Then it's finished.					SHARAT			Not quite...	He turns and faces a wall behind them... and for the first 	time we reveal the full Harvester STOCKPILE: it's an entire 	wall LINED WITH CANISTERS, each filled with the bright orange 	Harvester gel.					SHARAT				(continuing)			We shouldn't rest until the entire 			Kellerun and T'Lani supply of 			Harvesters has been destroyed...	Everyone eyes the stockpile with an ominous respect...					BASHIR			We'll begin immediately.	Pull into the stockpile, death in every drop...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              DEEP SPACE: "Armageddon Game" - REV. 11/12/93 - ACT ONE 6-7A.                                  ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)5    EXT.

The Doctor here 			deserves the bulk of the credit.					BASHIR			Actually, it was a team effort...					O'BRIEN			The Doctor's just being modest.

He brings it over 	to the genetic bath and holds it out for Bashir.  (The 	T'Lani and Kellerun scientists from before are present.  	O'Brien is off to the side, watching from the circuit 	control station.)					NYDROM			The last cylinder...
