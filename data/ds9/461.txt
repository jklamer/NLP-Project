A 			team of Cardassian scientists is 			coming to the station to assist us 			in deploying a subspace relay in the 			Gamma Quadrant... if successful, it 			will allow communication through the 			wormhole for the first time.2    INT. GUEST QUARTERS	as SISKO and ODO ENTER the empty quarters.  The room has 	been decorated with Cardassian furniture and artwork.					ODO			I've assigned these quarters to the 			senior Cardassian scientist...				(checks his PADD)			Her name is Ulani... her colleague... 			Gilora, has the adjacent room.	Sisko looks around the room, checking things over...					SISKO				(tugs at his collar)			It's warm in here...

I want the Cardassians to 			feel like guests, not prisoners.					ODO			Commander, there are still elements 			opposed to the peace treaty between 			Cardassia and Bajor... on both sides.  			We need to be prepared for trouble.					SISKO			I realize that.  But while the 			Cardassians are here, I want the 			Bajorans to get used to seeing them 			walking on the Promenade... buying 			from their shops, eating at their 			restaurants -- getting to know them 			as something other than brutal 			overseers.	DAX ENTERS, carrying a PADD.					DAX			I just received the final update 			from the Cardassians on the 			transceiver they designed for the 			communications relay.					SISKO			How's it look?					DAX			I'm still not convinced it's going 			to work...           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - TEASER            3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			The Cardassians seem sure that it 			will.					DAX			I hope they're right...	Suddenly the door OPENS and QUARK ENTERS, carrying TWO BOTTLES 	of Kanar, each with a little card attached.					QUARK			Whose quarters are these?  Gilora's 			or Ulani's?	Sisko and Odo exchange a look.					ODO			Ulani's... but how do you know their 			names?  I was just informed an hour 			ago.					QUARK				(insulted by the 				question)			Odo, please...				(beat)			I have a bottle of Kanar for each of 			them, along with a personal invitation 			to Quark's...	Dax takes one of the bottles and looks it over.					DAX			Where'd you get real Kanar?					QUARK			I've had three cases in my  			storeroom since the occupation.  			There hasn't been much demand for 			it these past few years...				(beaming)			-- but that's about to change.	Sisko hates to disabuse him of this notion, but...					SISKO			There are only two Cardassians coming 			to the station.  How much Kanar do 			you think they can drink?           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - TEASER            4.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					QUARK				(sure of it)			There may only be two for now, but 			there'll be more... thanks to the 			peace treaty.					DAX			And as the thirty-fourth Rule of 			Acquisition states... "Peace is good 			for business... "					QUARK			That's the thirty-fifth Rule.					DAX			Oh, that's right.  What's the thirty-			fourth?					QUARK			War is good for business...				(off Dax's look)			It's easy to get them confused...	Dax can't help but shake her head... she opens the bottle of 	Kanar, sniffs it...					QUARK			The way I see it, it won't be long 			before there's a permanent Cardassian 			presence on the station... scientists, 			diplomats... spies.					ODO			And they'll all be welcome at Quark's.					QUARK			As long as they can pay.  Rumor has 			it that the shop next door to mine 			is going to close... I'm thinking of 			renting it, and setting up a few...				(winks)			-- Cardassian gaming concessions.					ODO			There'll be no live vole fights on 			the Promenade, Quark.					QUARK				(feigning indignance)			I would never be party to anything 			so cruel and inhumane...           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - TEASER            5.2    CONTINUED:	(4)					QUARK			... but of course, if some Cardassians 			happened to bring their voles along... 			and they happened to get into a fight, 			I could hardly be held responsible 			for what --					ODO			Oh, yes you could.					SISKO			And you will be.	In the background, Dax puts some Kanar on her finger to taste 	it...					QUARK				(annoyed)			Fine... forget the vole fights.  But 			I'll tell you this, good Kanar is 			hard to find.  And I have three cases 			of it.  But that's just the beginning.  			Soon, Quark's will become known as 			the best place for Cardassian food 			and drink in this sector.  I'll 			probably set up daily shipments from 			Cardassia... I may even need to buy 			my own transport ship.	Dax makes a face when she tastes the Kanar...					DAX			Quark, this Kanar's gone bad...					QUARK			What?	Quark grabs the bottle, tastes it.  He grimaces, struggles 	to hold it down.  The other three exchange amused looks...					ODO			I suggest you take your bottles and 			leave, Quark, before I have you 			arrested for attempting to poison 			our guests...           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - TEASER            6.2    CONTINUED:	(5)	They head for the door... off Quark's dejected face as he 	looks at the useless bottles...3    INT.

He 			says it's urgent.	Sisko nods, and she turns and motions to someone behind her.  	YARKA ENTERS; he's forty or fifty, with a kind face and a 	gentle smile.					YARKA			Thank you for seeing me, Emissary...					SISKO			What can I do for you?					YARKA			I'm here to bring a warning from the 			Prophets...

COMMANDER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS	Sisko, Kira, and Yarka.					SISKO			Are you making some sort of threat, 			Vedek?					YARKA			Not at all... I'm simply telling you 			what was foretold in the ancient 			texts.					KIRA			Ancient texts?  You mean a prophecy?					YARKA				(nods)			Trakor's third, when he first 			encountered the Orb of Change.					KIRA			I don't know it.	Yarka seems disappointed to hear that his fellow Bajoran 	doesn't know her prophecies.					YARKA				(gently chastising)			Perhaps you should make more time to 			study the texts, child.					SISKO			Are you saying that the arrival of 			the Cardassian scientists was foretold 			in a Bajoran prophecy?					YARKA			Exactly.  Trakor's words are clear... 			"when the river wakes, stirred once 			more to Janir's side... three vipers 			will return to their nest in the 			sky."				(beat)			The river has awoken, Emissary...           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE           8.4    CONTINUED:					KIRA				(realizing)			The Qui'al dam was just put back 			into operation to divert water to 			the city.					YARKA			Just as Trakor prophesied over three 			thousand years ago.				(grave)			And even now, the vipers are making 			their way here.					SISKO			I take it you think the vipers are a 			reference to the Cardassian 			scientists.					YARKA			Yes... and this station is their 			nest in the sky.	Sisko chooses his words carefully; even though he doesn't 	quite believe any of this, he's being cautious.					SISKO			And how, exactly, will their presence 			here bring destruction on us all?					YARKA			Trakor said that "when the vipers 			try to peer through the temple 			gates... a sword of stars will appear 			in the heavens...				(dire)			-- the temple will burn... and its 			gates will be cast open... "	Yarka turns to Sisko, makes an impassioned plea.					YARKA			You must not let the Cardassians 			come here... you must not let them 			violate the celestial temple... or 			they will destroy it.  And Bajor 			will be cut off from the Prophets 			forever.					SISKO			Slow down... let me get this straight.  			You're saying that the vipers -- the 			Cardassians -- are going to destroy 			the wormhole?           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE           9.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					YARKA			Don't you see?  This communications 			relay you hope to create is part of 			the prophecy... it will allow the 			vipers to peer through the temple 			gates... the wormhole, as you call 			it.  And if they do, the temple will 			be destroyed.					KIRA			Even if we accept that the Cardassians 			are the vipers... there are only two 			of them coming, not three.  Isn't it 			possible that there are other mistakes 			in your interpretation of the prophecy 			as well?					YARKA			There will be three vipers... you 			will see...	Sisko sees that Yarka won't be dissuaded, takes another tack.					SISKO			Do you understand what this 			communications relay could mean for 			Bajor?  If it works, we'll be able 			to stay in contact with ships in the 			Gamma Quadrant.					KIRA			It'll facilitate exploration, help 			us monitor Dominion activity... give 			us warning in case of attack.					YARKA			None of that matters.				(to Sisko, pleading)			You must listen to me.  I know it's 			difficult for you to accept because 			you are not Bajoran.           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE          10.4    CONTINUED:	(3)					YARKA (Cont'd)			I've studied the prophecies all my 			life.  We are on the verge of a great 			disaster.					SISKO			Is the Bajoran Assembly aware of 			this prophecy?					YARKA				(reluctant)			Yes... as is the Kai herself.					SISKO			Yet they still want us to proceed 			with the establishment of the 			communications relay.					YARKA				(bitter)			They have chosen to ignore the 			signs...				(beat)			That's why I came to you, Emissary.  			Because I have faith in you.  I know 			that you'll do what must be done.	Sisko feels he should make his position clear.					SISKO			Vedek, I have the utmost respect for 			your beliefs... but I have no 			intention of calling this project 			off.	Yarka is disappointed, but doesn't give up.					YARKA			I hope that you will reconsider, 			Emissary...				(standing)			My followers and I will remain on 			the station and pray that you change 			your mind.					SISKO			You're free to do that, of course.	Yarka stands... bows his head slightly to Sisko.  He EXITS.  	Sisko and Kira exchange a look.           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE          11.4    CONTINUED:	(4)					SISKO			Have Odo find out what he can about 			Vedek Yarka and his followers... I 			don't want them making any trouble 			while the Cardassians are here.	Kira acknowledges and EXITS... off Sisko's thoughtful 	expression...5    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	as it hangs in space.6    INT. AIRLOCK	where Sisko, Kira and a few Bajoran SECURITY PERSONNEL are 	waiting to greet the Cardassians.  The airlocks slide OPEN 	and TWO CARDASSIAN CIVILIANS emerge, both women.	The leader of the scientists, ULANI, is a pleasant and 	attractive woman.  GILORA is a little younger than Ulani 	and perhaps a bit more conventionally Cardassian.	This is the first joint project between two powers in an 	uneasy peace, so the scene plays out like a meeting between 	Americans and Russians at the height of the Cold War -- a 	lot of diplomatic language is bandied about to cover 	everyone's discomfort.					SISKO			I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko... and 			on behalf of the United Federation 			of Planets and Starfleet Command, 			I'd like to welcome you to Deep Space 			Nine.					ULANI			Thank you, Commander.  I'm Doctor 			Ulani Belor...					GILORA			Gilora Rejal...					ULANI			The Cardassian Government wishes to 			express its gratitude to the 			Federation for agreeing to work 			together on this project.           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE         11A.6    CONTINUED:					GILORA			It is our hope that it will be the 			first of many joint projects between 			our peoples.					SISKO			That's a hope that I can assure you 			we share.				(turning to Kira)			This is my First Officer, Major Kira.					KIRA			On behalf of the Bajoran Provisional 			Government, I'd also like to welcome 			you.  It's our belief that this 			project will mark the beginning of a 			new era of peace between Bajor and 			Cardassia.					ULANI			Thank you, Major.	Now that the diplomatic greetings are over with, there's an 	awkward beat as everyone realizes they have nothing left to 	say to each other.  Sisko decides to break the ice.					SISKO				(smiling)			Well... now that we've gotten the 			formalities out of the way... how 			was your trip?	Everyone relaxes a bit... Ulani smiles at Sisko, grateful 	for his gesture...					ULANI			Exhausting... we spent most of it 			rehearsing what we were going to say 			when we got here.					GILORA			We're scientists, not diplomats.					SISKO			You did very well.					ULANI			Please feel free to let the Central 			Command know that.  In the past few 			days I've been contacted by Guls 			I've never even heard of, all of 			them wanting to emphasize how 			important this mission is.           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE         11B.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			I know what you mean.  I got three 			calls from Starfleet Command just 			this morning.	They all share a smile... Ulani hesitates a beat before 	continuing.					ULANI			Major Kira... I want to thank you 			personally for allowing us to come 			here.					KIRA			Me?					ULANI			You're the ranking Bajoran officer 			on this station.  I'm sure we wouldn't 			be here if you'd been opposed to 			working with us.					KIRA			I'll work with anyone who's interested 			in peace.					ULANI			I'm glad we already have so much in 			common...	Kira manages a smile... unsure how to deal with this 	surprisingly friendly Cardassian.  After a beat, Sisko 	gestures down the corridor.					SISKO			Well... why don't I show you to your 			quarters...	As the group moves off...           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE          12.7    INT. WARDROOM	Sisko, O'BRIEN, Dax and the two Cardassians -- ULANI and 	Gilora -- are seated around the table discussing the mission.  	On the MONITOR we see an OKUDAGRAM of the wormhole, its two 	funnel-like openings on either end.  On one side is a 	representation of DS9, on the other, the communications 	satellite is positioned near the wormhole's mouth.					SISKO			The signaling platform we've designed 			is intended to be positioned in the 			Gamma Quadrant at this point...				(indicates diagram)			... two kilometers from the far mouth 			of the wormhole.					ULANI			Our transceiver has been configured 			to fit inside it, and use its existing 			power grid.					GILORA			A similar transceiver will be put in 			place here on Terok Nor --				(covering)			-- on Deep Space Nine.	Gilora is little embarrassed by her slip of the tongue, but 	our people don't seem to be bothered by it.					DAX			Ulani, I've looked over your design 			specifications.  I'm not clear what 			sort of carrier wave you're planning 			to use to cut through the interference 			inside the wormhole.           DEEP SPACE: "Destiny" - REV. 12/19/94 - ACT ONE          13.7    CONTINUED:					ULANI			We're planning to test various types 			of soliton pulses... one of them 			should maintain the required signal 			integrity.					O'BRIEN			We tried something similar about a 			year ago without much success...					GILORA			The Bajoran Government made your 			data available to us...

I hope 			it won't cause you too much trouble 			when you get back to Cardassia.					GILORA			My superiors in the science ministry 			will protect me.
