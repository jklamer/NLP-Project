QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL	A low angle shot of ROM and LEETA, deep in thought as 	they study something below the screen.					ROM 			What do you think?					LEETA				(less than thrilled) 			I don't know. What do you think?					ROM				(smiling)			I like it.2    NEW ANGLE	To reveal that Rom and Leeta are leaning over the table 	staring down at a large PADD which displays a fashion 	sketch of a Bajoran woman in a very skimpy wedding 	dress. Well, almost a dress. Kind of a negligee, but 	with less fabric.	GARAK and ZIYAL are seated across from Rom and Leeta, 	awaiting the verdict of the bride-to-be.					ROM			Don't you?					LEETA 			Rom, it's two handkerchiefs and a 			loincloth.					ROM 			I suppose we could lose the 			handkerchiefs.					LEETA 			Ferengi tradition or no Ferengi 			tradition, I am not going to be 			naked at my wedding.					ROM 			Who said anything about naked? 			You'll still have the loincloth.	Leeta shoves the PADD over to Garak.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					LEETA 			Please show us something else.					GARAK 			There is nothing else. I've shown 			you a hundred and fifty-three 			different wedding dresses, from 			Tellerite modern to...				(indicates the current				dress)			Risian traditional. And you've			hated them all.					LEETA 			I liked number thirty-eight.					ROM 			Number thirty-eight? It had more 			layers than a Baduvian tapestry.					LEETA 			It was elegant.					ROM 			It was bulky.					ZIYAL 			I like sixty-four.	Rom and Leeta both make faces.					LEETA 			Sixty-four?					ROM 			Eeeesh.					GARAK 			At least they agree on something.					ZIYAL 			Why don't you just let Garak 			design a dress on his own? You 			know whatever he comes up with 			will be beautiful.					GARAK 			My dear, I find your blind 			adoration both flattering and 			disturbing.				(to Rom and Leeta) 			But she does have a point.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Before Rom and Leeta can respond to Ziyal's suggestion, 	QUARK comes storming up the stairs.					QUARK			Leeta. That fifteen minute break 			you asked for was up an hour ago.					ROM 			Brother, what do you think of this 			dress?	Rom shows Quark the PADD with the skimpy dress, but 	Quark averts his eyes.					QUARK 			I don't want to think about it. 			All I know is that any marriage 			where the female's allowed to 			speak and wear clothing is doomed 			to failure.				(to Leeta) 			Your dabo table awaits.	But something catches Leeta's attention just off 	screen.					LEETA 			There he is.	Everyone looks out at the Promenade, where SISKO is 	walking with CHIEF O'BRIEN.					LEETA 			Let's talk to him.					ROM 			Now?					LEETA 			Now, Rom.3    ANGLE ON SISKO AND O'BRIEN	As they walk along the Second Level.					SISKO 			Try to look on the bright side, 			Chief. It won't be forever.					O'BRIEN 			I know. And I understand why you 			ordered all the children off the 			station. Keiko and the kids will 			be a lot safer on Earth than here. 			But they've only been gone two 			days and I miss them already.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - TEASER       4.3    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			I still feel better knowing 			they're out of harm's way. I just 			wish I could talk Jake into 			visiting Earth for a while.	Just then, Rom and Leeta approach Sisko.					LEETA 			Captain, can we speak to you for 			a moment?					ROM 			If you're not too busy.					SISKO 			Go ahead.					ROM 			Would you marry me? I mean us? 			I mean, would you perform our 			wedding ceremony?					LEETA 			It would be a great honor to be 			married by the Emissary.					ROM 			It's not for another two weeks. 			So you'd have plenty of time to 			get ready.					SISKO 				(smiling) 			I'll start brushing up on my 			Bajoran.					ROM 			Me too.	As Sisko is talking to Rom and Leeta, a crowd begins to 	gather by the windows. It's a mixture of Federation, 	Bajoran and Klingon personnel. Their mood is somber 	and quiet.					O'BRIEN 			Captain.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - TEASER       5.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO				(to Rom and Leeta) 			If you'll excuse me.	Sisko steps over to the window and joins O'Brien.4    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	On Sisko, O'Brien, and the others, including Rom and 	Leeta. They stand there for a beat, looking out at the 	stars and waiting.					O'BRIEN 			Maybe they're not coming.					SISKO			That would be a nice surprise.	Just then, the wormhole opens outside the window.									CUT TO:5    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	As a convoy of Dominion ships emerges from the 	wormhole.6    INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL (OPTICAL)	Sisko and O'Brien watch the Dominion ships disappear, 	their expressions grim.					SISKO				(disappointed) 			I'll say one thing for the 			Dominion, they're punctual.					O'BRIEN 			That's the fifth convoy headed to 			Cardassia in the last five weeks. 			I can only imagine how many 			Jem'Hadar soldiers they have 			stationed there by now.					SISKO			Too many.					O'BRIEN 			Sometimes I wish they'd just 			attack and get it over with.					SISKO 			I have a feeling you're going to 			get your wish.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - TEASER      5A.6    CONTINUED:	Sisko and O'Brien stare out the window as the Dominion 	ships continue to pour into the Alpha Quadrant.

I 			haven't had a home-cooked meal 			since...					SISKO			Since the last time you were here.					JAKE 			Sounds about right. So, what's 			for dinner?	Sisko places a PADD on Jake's place. Jake looks down 	at it.					JAKE				(deadpan) 			Can I have some salsa with that?					SISKO			Read the headline.					JAKE 			"Bajorans Continue Negotiations 			with the Dominion."					SISKO			Go on.					JAKE 			"Station Commander Opposes Non-			aggression Pact."					SISKO			And the byline.					JAKE 			By Jake Sisko.	Sisko serves the actual meal and sits down.					SISKO			You should've warned me.					JAKE 			I was waiting for the right moment.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - ACT ONE      7.7    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			The right moment would've been 			before you published the article.					JAKE 			I know. I'm sorry.				(a beat, spin-doctoring) 			But aren't you glad I got a job?					SISKO			You mean this isn't a one-time 			thing?					JAKE 			Nope. I'm now an official 			correspondent for the Federation 			News Service.					SISKO			What about your novel?					JAKE 			I'm not giving up on it. But this 			way I get to see my work in print.					SISKO			And apparently, I get to see 			everything I say in print too.					JAKE 			You're a public figure, Dad. 			You're the captain of the most 			important space station in the 			entire Federation. You're news.					SISKO			Don't remind me.				(resigned) 			I guess I can't stop you from 			doing your job.					JAKE 			Can I quote you on that?	Sisko stares at Jake. He's not getting any more quotes 	today.					JAKE 			I guess not.8    INT. CARGO BAY	DAX and KIRA are walking through the bay checking 	crates of cargo. ODO, having just brought them some 	information, is waiting for a response.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - ACT ONE      8.8    CONTINUED:	Odo and Kira are not looking very comfortable around 	one another. Obviously, there's been some fallout from 	the events seen in "CHILDREN OF TIME."					KIRA 			Yamok sauce? Who'd bother to 			smuggle in ten thousand wrappages 			of Cardassian yamok sauce?	Almost instantly it comes clear to all three of them.					KIRA 			Quark. That little worm. He 			thinks the Cardassians are going 			to retake the station.					DAX			He's a Ferengi. You can't blame him 			for hedging his bets. 				(to herself) 			But that is a lot of yamok sauce. 				(to Kira and Odo) 			What exactly is a yamok, anyway?					ODO 			What would you like me to do with 			it?	Dax looks to Kira.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - ACT ONE      9.8    CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX			Major?					KIRA				(to Dax)			I don't care. You decide.					DAX 				(to Odo)			Dump it.					ODO			Very good.	Odo nods and EXITS.9    CLOSE ON DAX AND KIRA	Dax studies her friend as Kira continues along checking 	more of the crates.					DAX			You mind telling me what's going			on?					KIRA			What do you mean?					DAX			You and Odo. You've been avoiding			each other for weeks.					KIRA			It's a long story.					DAX			Those are the best kind.	Kira stops and turns to Dax. She's torn. She wants to 	get this off her chest, but it's not easy.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - ACT ONE     10.9    CONTINUED:	Kira takes a long beat, then decides to plunge ahead.					KIRA			Odo... has... feelings for me.					DAX 			What kind of feelings?					KIRA			The kind that aren't easy to talk 			about.					DAX			Since when?					KIRA			I don't know. Years. I just 			found out about it last month.					DAX			That explains a lot.					KIRA				(surprised) 			It does?					DAX			Not really. It just seemed like 			the right thing to say. I had no			idea.					KIRA			Neither did I.	Kira's not sure that talking to Dax was such a good 	idea after all.10   EXT.

Just don't 			forget the one hundred and 			ninetieth Rule of Acquisition.					NOG 			"Hear all; trust nothing." Good 			advice, sir.	Nog EXITS.12   CLOSE ON SISKO 	As he picks up his baseball and absentmindedly turns it 	in his hand.					SISKO				(to himself) 			The Romulans?	After a beat, Sisko speaks into the air.					SISKO 			Sisko to Dax.					DAX'S COM VOICE 			Dax here.					SISKO			Put me through to Starfleet 			Intelligence.13   INT.

He slams the table.					WORF			The Romulans. I always knew they 			were without honor. Now they have 			proven it.					BASHIR			When did they sign the treaty?					SISKO			Yesterday.					O'BRIEN			They must be pretty desperate to 			side with the Dominion.					SISKO			Technically they're not siding 			with anyone. It's a non-			aggression pact.					KIRA			Meaning if the Dominion does 			attack, they're going to sit by 			and do nothing.					ODO			The Romulans, the Miradorn, the 			Tholians. The Dominion's making 			impressive inroads in the Alpha 			Quadrant.					DAX			And the Bajorans are still talking 			to them.					KIRA			My people will never sign that 			treaty. Or any other agreement 			with the Dominion.					O'BRIEN			Meanwhile, more Jem'Hadar ships 			are coming through the wormhole 			every week.					WORF 			It must stop.	Sisko nods in agreement.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - ACT ONE     14.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 			It's going to stop. 				(a beat) 			I've talked to Starfleet Command. 			And they've agreed that no more 			Dominion ships can be allowed into 			the Alpha Quadrant.					O'BRIEN			How do we keep them out?					SISKO			We're going to mine the entrance 			to the wormhole. Prevent the 			Dominion from bringing any more 			reinforcements to Cardassia.	Sisko pauses for a beat to that sink in.					ODO 			If we try to stop those convoys, 			it may very well start a war.					SISKO			Maybe so.

DAX'S QUARTERS 	Dax, O'Brien and Rom are sitting around a table spread 	with food, drink and five or six different PADDS. 	They're discussing the minefield, but, since Dax is 	running things, the atmosphere is informal. Think the 	Manhattan Project, a group of scientists and engineers 	getting together to solve a problem, where the physics 	are more important than winning the war.					O'BRIEN 			What about pulse mines? We could 			equip them with variable geometry 			detonators.					DAX			Not good enough. The Dominion 			ships could just wait at the mouth 			of the wormhole and pick them off 			one by one.					O'BRIEN			What if we cloaked them?					DAX			Cloaks don't always work against 			the Dominion.					O'BRIEN			Maybe cloaked ships don't, but I'm 			thinking a lot smaller. Each mine 			no more than a meter across.					DAX			A mine that small wouldn't have 			much power. It would take dozens 			of them to disable a warship. 			We'd run out of mines before they 			ran out of ships.	Dax looks over at Rom.					DAX 			Rom, are you here?					ROM 			Cloak. Small. Dozens. I heard 			every word.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - ACT TWO     16.14   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			Well something's wrong. You 			haven't touched your food.					ROM 			It's my stomach. Ever since 			Captain Sisko agreed to officiate 			at our wedding, I haven't had much 			of an appetite.					O'BRIEN			I thought you wanted Captain Sisko 			to marry you.					ROM 			I did. But now that he's said 			yes, it's become so... real.				(terrified) 			I'm going to get married.					DAX 			Not for another two weeks. And in 			the meantime, we've got work to 			do.					ROM 			But what if Leeta turns out to be 			just like Nog's mother? What if 			I can't make her happy? What if 			this is the biggest mistake of my 			life? What if...	O'Brien doesn't have much patience for Rom's anxieties.					O'BRIEN			Rom.					ROM 			Self-replication! That's the only 			answer.					DAX 			Self-replication?					ROM			If the mines are going to be 			small, we'll need a lot of them. 			And we'll need a way to replace 			them quickly if the Jem'Hadar try 			to blast their way through. And...				(still panicking) 			Uh-oh. I forgot to request new 			quarters. Mine are too small. 			Where are Leeta and I going to 			live?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Call to Arms" - REV. 04/24/97 - ACT TWO     17.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX 			Rom, I think you're on to 			something.					ROM 			I know I am.

Twenty or thirty mines 			for each ship.					ROM 			The only problem is you'll have to 			wait until the entire minefield is 			deployed before you activate it. 			Otherwise the proximity sensors c			ould cause premature detonation.				(freaking) 			Where's Leeta going to put all her 			clothes?				(a wail of torment)			I don't have enough closet space.					DAX			I'd better go talk to Sisko.					O'BRIEN			I'll go draw up some specs.	They both look to Rom to see what he's going to do.					ROM 			I've got to go to waste 			extraction.	And with that, Rom rushes out of the room.14A  INT.
