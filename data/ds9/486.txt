INFIRMARY	KIRA lies on the bed as BASHIR prepares a hypo.					KIRA			Is all this really necessary?					BASHIR			The Klingon invasion has all but			destroyed the Cardassian health			system. They're suffering			outbreaks of all kinds of diseases			and in epidemic proportions				(smiles)			Besides, you only have twelve more			inoculations.					KIRA			Twelve?					BASHIR			Sorry, but if you want to go to			the conference...					KIRA			I don't want to go. I'm no			diplomat. Going to some obscure			Cardassian outpost to share			Bajoran intelligence about the			Klingons isn't exactly the kind of			thing I'm good at. I'm not sure			why I even agreed to go.					BASHIR			You agreed because it was a			personal request from the First			Minister of Bajor.					KIRA			It was a personal request all			right. Shakaar took me to my			favorite restaurant in Jalanda			City, poured me glass after glass			of spring wine, then took me back			to his home, and gave me a massage			with Kolaish spice oil.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - TEASER        2.1    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Nice to know he keeps in touch			with his constituents.					KIRA				(still grousing)			It wasn't fair. At that point, I			would have said yes to anything.	Bashir applies the hypo. Kira sits up and immediately	holds her head.					BASHIR			What is it?					KIRA				(frightened)			I'm seeing spots...					BASHIR			Big, green, swirling ones?					KIRA			The size of Alvinian melons.					BASHIR			And the room is starting to spin?					KIRA				(panicky)			Yes.	Bashir smiles.					BASHIR			Good. Means the vaccine's			working. Everything will settle			down in a moment.	As Kira gets her bearings, WORF ENTERS.					WORF				(to Kira)			May I speak with you?					KIRA			I'm not going anywhere.	Bashir steps up to Kira with another hypo.					BASHIR			This one might make you a little			queasy.				(to Worf)			If you have something to say to			her, you'd better make it fast.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - TEASER        3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)	Worf isn't pleased about being rushed, but launches	into his business.					WORF			Major, the Federation has some			concerns about your upcoming			meeting with the Cardassians.					KIRA			So do I.					WORF			There are certain technological			advances we have shared with both			Bajor and the Klingons that we			would prefer to keep out of			Cardassian hands.					KIRA			Such as?					WORF			Photon torpedo guidance systems,			long-range sensors, enhanced warp			core overdrives. This is a			complete list.	Worf hands Kira a PADD. She looks it over. Kira is	rather uncomfortable with all this.					KIRA			I think the Cardassians are going			to be a little disappointed.	Kira looks queasy.					WORF			Undoubtedly.					KIRA				(nauseous)			Anything else.					WORF			No.					KIRA			Good. I'll be right back.	She rushes off before she tosses her lunch.					BASHIR				(to Worf)			I'm glad I'm not going to			Cardassia.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - TEASER        4.2    INT. PROMENADE	Kira emerges from the infirmary yawning and stretching,	shaking off the effects of the hypo she was given. She	doesn't get far before --					QUARK (O.S.)			Major!	Kira stops as QUARK catches up to her carrying a small	box. Quark hands Kira the box.					QUARK			This is for you, Major. For your			journey. It's fresh hasperat.			Not replicated. I know how you			hate Cardassian food, so...	Kira just stares at Quark.					QUARK			Well, aren't you going to thank			me?					KIRA			What do you want, Quark?					QUARK			Me? Why -- nothing.	Kira gives him a look -- she knows better.					QUARK				(off her look)			Don't you believe me capable of a			gesture of friendship that has no			strings attached?					KIRA			No.	After a beat, Quark smiles and shrugs.					QUARK			Well, you're right. Now, what I			need is for you to look up an old			friend of mine in the Ministry of			Trade. He was stationed on Bajor			during the occupation... and when			he left...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - TEASER        5.2    CONTINUED:					QUARK (Cont'd)			... in quite a hurry I may add...			he forgot to pay his very			extensive bar tab.					KIRA			You want me to interrupt my			mission to collect an old debt for			you?					QUARK			The way I see it, you should start			by demanding twenty-two bars of			latinum -- which includes the			interest accumulated. He'll offer			you eight, you can settle for			twelve.	Kira hands him back his gift box.					KIRA			I'd rather settle for replicated			hasperat.	Kira turns her back on Quark and walks away. We stay	on Quark as he wistfully mutters to himself:					QUARK			I tried...3    ON KIRA	walking down the Promenade.					DAXIS COM VOICE (O.S.)			Ops to Major Kira.					KIRA			Go ahead.					DAXIS COM VOICE (O.S.)			Your Cardassian escort ship -- the			Groumall -- is due to arrive in			thirty minutes.

What are you doing here?					DUKAT			I'm to escort you to your meeting			on Korma.	Kira is surprised.					KIRA			You're commanding the Groumall?	Dukat remains his arrogant self throughout this	admission.					DUKAT			Thanks to you.				(off Kira's reaction)			If you hadn't convinced me to			bring my half-Bajoran daughter			back to Cardassia, I'd still be			the chief military advisor to the			Detepa Council.					KIRA			They demoted you.					DUKAT			Exactly one week after my mother			disowned me, and my wife took our			children and left.					KIRA			You still did the right thing,			Dukat.					DUKAT			And as a reward for following your			advice, I have been relegated to			ferrying freight and,			occasionally, various foreign			dignitaries -- such as yourself.					KIRA			Look, if blaming me makes you feel			better, go right ahead.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 TEASER         7.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					DUKAT				(shaking his head)			I blame no one but myself.

CARDASSIAN FREIGHTER - KIRA'S STATEROOM	The Cardassian stateroom may be the best room on the	ship, but it's not much -- certainly not opulent. Kira	is settling in for her trip when the door CHIMES.					KIRA			Come in.	The door opens to reveal TORA ZIYAL, Dukat's eighteen-	year-old daughter by his Bajoran mistress (from	"Indiscretion"). Kira is happy to see her.					KIRA			Ziyal! I didn't know you were on			board.					ZIYAL			Hello, Major.					KIRA			Please, call me Nerys.	Kira and Ziyal sit, making themselves as comfortable as	possible in the tight quarters.					KIRA			I take it living on Cardassia			didn't work out very well.					ZIYAL			I wasn't exactly welcomed with			open arms. There were some			Cardassians who could see past the			Bajoran ridges on my nose... but			not many.					KIRA			I'm sorry. I know it must have			been difficult for you...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - ACT ONE       9.6    CONTINUED:					ZIYAL			This may seem odd to you--but			there were times on Cardassia when			I almost missed being a prisoner			of the Breen. At least there, the			Bajoran and Cardassian prisoners			accepted me for who I was.				(a beat)			The only good thing about living			on Cardassia was being with my			father.					KIRA			I'm glad you two are getting			along.	Ziyal smiles. Talking about her father makes her	genuinely happy.					ZIYAL			He's been wonderful.				(a beat)			And so brave. He never tried to			hide me away. He never acted like			he was ashamed of me. We'd go out			to dinner, take long walks			together. Once he even took me to			a performance of his favorite			Didactic Theater group. We sat			right up in front.				(a beat)			He was so intimidating, no one			dared to challenge my right to be			there.					KIRA			And now that he's been exiled...					ZIYAL			Wherever he goes, I go. He's the			only family I have.				(re: the freighter)			And this is the only home I need.	Ziyal seems at peace, but Kira knows that her life has	not been easy and the future isn't much brighter.					KIRA			Your father isn't the only one			who's brave.	A loud ALARM SOUNDS OFF.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - ACT ONE      10.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			What's that?	Ziyal stands calmly, ready to leave.					ZIYAL			It's a battle drill.					KIRA			On a freighter?7    INT. CARDASSIAN FREIGHTER - BRIDGE	Dukat barks orders to his crew -- two Cardassian	CREWMEN and the first officer, GLINN DAMAR. From his	demeanor, you'd think Dukat was on the bridge of the	Potemkin.					DAMAR			Target at four hundred thousand			kilometers and closing.	Kira and Ziyal ENTER.

We're			going to do it again --	As the crew begins doing as instructed, Dukat turns to	see Kira -- and off her look, feels the need to justify	his actions.					DUKAT			This may be a lowly freighter,			major, but it's still a military			vessel and it will be run in a			military manner.            DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - ACT ONE            12.9    CONTINUED:	Kira nods. She has no argument with that, but she does	have something on her mind.					KIRA			You know, you could speed up your			phaser recharge time by routing			power through an anodyne			capacitor.					DUKAT				(sarcastic)			Thank you, major... that's very			helpful. And if we had an anodyne			capacitor, I would use it. But we			don't.	Dukat realizes he's being unreasonable. Kira was only	trying to help.					DUKAT				(smiling)			Forgive me, major. I appreciate			your suggestion. Any anger I			might have expressed was due to my			frustration over the complete			inadequacy of this vessel.				(a beat)			I hope you'll let me make it up to			you.					KIRA				(faintly suspicious)			What did you have in mind?					DUKAT			I was hoping we could dine			together. After all, it is			Cardassian tradition for the			commanding officer of a ship to			entertain his guests.	Kira thinks it over. She's already gone on a mission	with Dukat. Dinner doesn't seem too onerous.

Kira and Dukat sit at a well-set table in her	small quarters. Dukat has managed to procure the	finest china and the best food for their meal. Kira	takes a sip of wine.					KIRA			This is Bajoran Spring Wine, isn't			it?					DUKAT				(nods)			My last bottle. It's one of the			things I miss most about Bajor.					KIRA			I talked to Ziyal.

The			intelligence file I kept on him			during the occupation was filled			with reports of his conquests. In			fact, if you remember correctly,			you were the only female in his			resistance cell that he didn't			"charm"... at least until now.	Kira refuses to let Dukat get to her.					KIRA			Is that what you kept track of			during the occupation? No wonder			you lost.					DUKAT			A little more wine, Major?	But Kira is spared from answering by the ALARM SOUNDING	OFF once more.					KIRA			Another drill?	But Dukat shakes his head, he's as surprised as she is.					DUKAT			I didn't schedule one.	Dukat is halfway out the door already as Kira follows	after him.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - ACT ONE      15.12   INT.

KLINGON CORRIDOR (OPTICAL) 	The Klingon moves through the corridor where THREE more	KLINGONS work to repair a ruptured plasma line. Behind	them, Kira and Dukat MATERIALIZE.	Instantaneously, Kira and Dukat each FIRE one phaser	blast, hitting their respective targets. The two	remaining Klingons -- drawing their daggers -- pounce	on the intruders.	A ferocious hand-to-hand combat ensues. Kira is in her	element but she has to use every one of her fighting	skills to fend off the more powerful Klingon.	Dukat and the other Klingon also battle hand-to-hand,	but their fight is more evenly matched -- Cardassian	strength vs. Klingon strength. As the fight	progresses, it becomes clear that the Klingon may be a	tad stronger, but Dukat is a tad wilier. Eventually,	Dukat defeats the Klingon, killing him just moments	before Kira kills her opponent. Out of breath, Dukat	checks with Kira --					DUKAT			Major... ?					KIRA			Just give me a minute.	Using her tricorder, Kira finds an access panel and	removes it. Working quickly, she begins tapping some	keys on the panel and on her tricorder. Dukat moves to	guard the door as Kira continues working.					DUKAT			Hurry, major.					KIRA			Be quiet. I need to concentrate.	As Kira continues working...44B  INT.

CARDASSIAN FREIGHTER - BRIDGE	A very disoriented and surprised Klingon Captain and	his men MATERIALIZE aboard the empty freighter.44E INT. KLINGON BRIDGE 	Kira has taken a position at one of the terminals. She	taps a few keys, then announces:					KIRA			It worked. All our people are			here and all thirty-six Klingons			are on the freighter.				(allowing herself a				smile)			I can just imagine the Klingon			Captain explaining this to his			superiors...	Dukat has stepped up to the weapons terminal and is	working the panel.					DUKAT			He won't get the opportunity.	And just as Kira realizes what Dukat means, Dukat taps	the last key.44F EXT.

A proud Damar reports:					DAMAR			Weapons secured, sir.					DUKAT			Excellent.					ZIYAL			So is Engineering.	Dukat could not be prouder. Nor could Ziyal -- of her	father.					DUKAT			Well done.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - ACT FOUR      42.45   ON KIRA	turning to work on one of the consoles as Dukat walks	around the conquered ship -- his mind racing ahead of	him.					DUKAT			Quite a prize we've taken, Major.			The first Klingon bird of prey			ever captured by Cardassia...	Kira is scrolling through one of the Klingon monitors.					KIRA			I think I've found an even bigger			prize. It looks like we have the			target priorities of all the			Klingon raiders in Cardassian			space.	That is pure gold, and Dukat is on cloud nine.					DUKAT			I'll contact the Central Command			to inform them of our success.				(smiling)			I think I'll "request" that my			Legate title be reinstated,			effective immediately.	In the meantime, Damar has also gotten on one of the	terminals.

Kira and Damar are alone on the Bridge,	completing some repairs.

They			contain status reports from			Klingon ships and outposts			throughout Cardassian space. With			information like this, Cardassia			could launch a major counterattack			against the Klingons.					DUKAT			They could, but they won't.	Kira turns to look at Dukat for the first time.					KIRA			Why not?					DUKAT			Because the Detepa Council has			something else in mind... they've			ordered me not to engage the			Klingons in "any further			conflict." The Council is looking			for a diplomatic solution.				(a beat, bitter)			They've ordered me back to			Cardassia Prime to resume my post			as military advisor to the			council.	Kira is puzzled; Dukat's dejection seems	inappropriately severe.					KIRA			I thought that's what you wanted.					DUKAT				(still not happy)			It was. But what's the point of			being the military advisor to a			government that won't fight.					KIRA			You could change their minds.				(beat)			Try to convince your fellow			Cardassians to go on the			offensive.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - ACT FOUR      45.48   CONTINUED: 	(2)					DUKAT			No...

KLINGON BRIDGE	As before. Kira faces a resolute Dukat.					KIRA			Look, Dukat, I know you're angry,			but maybe you ought to think about			what you're proposing. You can't			go to war against the whole			Klingon Empire with one bird of			prey.					DUKAT			Why not? Your people fought us			for fifty years with less			sophisticated weaponry than this.			And you beat us.					KIRA			It's not the same. The Bajoran			people were united. We were all			working for the same goal. You			and your crew would be alone out			there...					DUKAT			Maybe at first. But perhaps our			actions will inspire others to			join the struggle.	Kira shakes her head. She's not buying it.					KIRA			It's not that easy, Dukat.					DUKAT			I know.				(a beat)			Which is why I need you.					KIRA				(surprised)			Me?					DUKAT			Who else?

I already have a job.					DUKAT				(scornful)			You mean on that space station?			We both know your talents are			wasted there. Coordinating			docking assignments and leading			training exercises. On Deep Space			Nine, you're nothing but a			bureaucrat, an administrator.				(a beat)			but if you come with me, you can			be a soldier again.	And for a moment, just one slight moment, the	possibility crosses Kira's mind. Dukat sees this and	thinks he's winning her over.					DUKAT			Think about it, major. The chance			to fight against a superior foe in			a righteous cause... to protect a			defeated and broken people from a			cruel aggressor.				(a beat)			You know as well as I do that if			Cardassia falls, Bajor is next.			Help me stop the Klingons before			you become their next target.					KIRA				(surprised)			You're really serious about this.					DUKAT			Absolutely. Look, Major, I'm not			asking you to like me -- or to be			my friend. I'm asking you to join			me. Fight at my side.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - ACT FIVE      48.50   CONTINUED:	(2)					DUKAT (Cont'd)				(a beat)			You know what I'm doing is right.			And what's more... it's what you			want to do as well.	Dukat can see her vacillating within her defiance, but	he also knows that if he presses her too far too soon,	he won't get the answer he wants.					DUKAT			I know that our past makes it hard			for you to accept me as an ally.				(a beat)			I know every fiber of your being			is telling you to say no, no,			no... but somewhere among all			those "no"s is a yes.

Try			to stab me with the knife --	Kira halfheartedly does as requested. Ziyal parries	the thrust with her forearm, spins and grabs Kira's arm	in an attempt to flip her over her shoulder. But Kira	simply twists her arm away and gently kicks Ziyal's	feet from under her. Ziyal ends up on the ground with	Kira holding the blade at her neck.					ZIYAL			I guess it wasn't such a good			trick.					KIRA			The best way to survive a knife			fight is to never get into one.					ZIYAL			If I'm going to help my father, I			have to be prepared for anything.				(enthusiastic)			Show me what you did again.	Kira just stands there.					ZIYAL			Please. I know I have a lot to			learn -- I've been practicing with			the disruptor rifle... but I need			to know how to defend myself in			hand-to-hand combat.				(almost embarrassed)			I was lucky not to have to fight			when we boarded this ship.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Return to Grace" - 12/07/95 - ACT FIVE      50.52   CONTINUED:	(2)					ZIYAL (Cont'd)			Next time I may not be so lucky.	A beat.
