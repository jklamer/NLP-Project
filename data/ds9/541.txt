On her way out, she spots 	KIRA and Quark at the bar. Quark is handing Kira the 	box of flowers.					KIRA			Thank you, Quark.					QUARK			Don't mention it, major.

She 			would've been sixty today.				(re: the flowers) 			My father always said these were 			her favorite.					DAX				(re: the flowers) 			What a nice way to remember your 			mother.					KIRA			I wish I did remember her.

You have an incoming 			transmission.					KIRA				(clearing the cobwebs) 			From whom?					COMPUTER VOICE 			Unable to identify.	That gets Kira's attention; she gets out of bed and 	steps over to the wall monitor.					KIRA			Put it through.5    ANGLE ON THE MONITOR (OPTICAL)	as it comes to life with the image of GUL DUKAT, seated 	at the controls of the shuttle he stole in "Waltz" (in 	other words, a one-wall set).					DUKAT 			Ah, major -- there you are.

I guarantee 			you won't be able to trace this 			transmission.					KIRA			Then why don't you just tell me 			where you are?					DUKAT 				(smiling) 			Because that's not why I called. 			I want to help you, major -- the 			way Captain Sisko helped me.					KIRA			I don't know what you're talking about.					DUKAT 			Captain Sisko gave me the clarity 			to see beyond the lies... the self-			deceptions that were controlling 			my life. He helped me see the 			truth about myself. 				(a beat) 			And now I'm going to do the same 			for you.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Wrongs...

That 			you know it's my mother's birthday?					DUKAT				(ignoring her) 			She was a striking woman, your 			Mother. Though when I met her, 			she was very self-conscious about 			that small scar along the side of 			her face. She used to try to 			cover it up with a strand of hair.	Dukat is starting to make Kira uncomfortable, though 	she tries to hide it.					KIRA 			Nice try, Dukat. But you never 			knew my mother. She died in the --					DUKAT				(interrupting) 			-- in the Singha refugee 			center? I'm afraid not, Major. 			That was something your father 			told you because he couldn't bear 			to face the truth.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Wrongs...

O'Brien 	stands there, holding his cup, not sure why they've 	earned the major's wrath.	Kira stares at him for a beat and he quickly finishes 	his raktajino, picks up his tool kit and hurries off.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Wrongs...
