SISKO'S QUARTERS	We're at the end of a dinner party that SISKO has	thrown for the senior staff, but it may be the most 	downbeat social affair on DS9 in the last two years. 	BASHIR and O'BRIEN are getting quietly drunk at one end 	of the table, a bottle of scotch sitting between them. 	KIRA and ODO are sitting next to them. WORF is 	standing off to one side, seeming to inspect Sisko's 	art collection, but it's really an excuse to avoid the 	after-dinner conversation. Sisko is at the head of the 	table, trying to be the genial host, but his heart just 	isn't in it tonight.	JAKE and NOG are removing the dirty dishes from the 	table and they exchange a few glances between them as 	the depressing evening drags on.					O'BRIEN			Did you hear about the Tiananmen? 			She was reported missing last 			night. Near the Cardassian border.					KIRA			That's three in the last three 			weeks.					BASHIR 			We're going to run out of ships at 			this rate.					KIRA			That's not funny.					BASHIR 			It wasn't meant to be. Unless 			Starfleet Command starts doing 			something about the Dominion, the 			situation's just going to get worse.					KIRA			What do you want Julian? A war?	But Sisko jumps in before Bashir has the chance to 	reply.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - TEASER       2.1    CONTINUED:					SISKO			What I want is to talk about 			something else. 				(beat) 			Chief, what about Kirayoshi -- is 			he walking yet?					O'BRIEN 			Not yet, Sir.	But O'Brien has nothing to add beyond that. Silence 	falls on the group again and Sisko tries once more to 	rally the troops.					SISKO 			Odo, I understand you're going to 			Bajor next week. Will you be 			seeing Doctor Mora?					ODO			Actually, I just canceled my 			trip. There's been a seventy-five 			percent jump in the theft of 			medical supplies and food rations 			on DS Nine. I haven't seen an 			increase like that since...	He suddenly feels awkward and trails off.					O'BRIEN 			Since... ?					ODO 			Since... just before the 			Cardassians were forced to abandon 			the station.	That hangs in the air for a long moment. Jake and Nog 	exchange a look as the gloom settles into the room.					BASHIR 				(standing) 			On that note... I think I'll turn 			in.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - TEASER       3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN 			Me, too. Thank you for dinner, 			captain. It was wonderful.	Sisko can only barely muster a smile for his officers 	as Kira and Odo stand to join the exodus.					SISKO 			It was my pleasure. Goodnight 			everyone.	Everyone exchanges goodnight's with Sisko, who remains 	at the table while O'Brien, Bashir, Kira and Odo EXIT. 	Sisko looks over and sees Worf still staring at the 	same piece of artwork on the wall, oblivious to the 	fact that the party is breaking up.					SISKO 			Mister Worf!	Worf turns, startled, and then is even more surprised 	to see that almost everyone is gone.					SISKO 			You've been paroled. The party's 			over.					WORF 			Thank you, sir. Goodnight.	Worf EXITS, leaving only Nog and Jake, who are now 	working on cleaning up the pots and pans.					SISKO 				(to boys) 			Don't bother with that. I'll 			clean up the rest. I want to be 			alone for awhile. Go on.					JAKE			Okay...					NOG 			Goodnight, sir.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - TEASER       4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)	Jake gives his father a quick kiss on the cheek and 	then reluctantly heads for the door. Jake and Nog 	EXIT, leaving Sisko very alone and very depressed.					COM VOICE			Ops to Captain Sisko.					SISKO 			Go ahead.					COM VOICE 			We just received a message from 			Bajor, Sir. Kai Winn will be 			coming to the station tomorrow 			morning and she'd like to meet 			with you.	Things just went from bad to worse.					SISKO 			Acknowledged.	Sisko sits down heavily and rubs a pair of very tired 	and unhappy eyes.2thru   OMITTED4   									CUT TO:5    INT. QUARK'S	A short time later. Nog and Jake are sitting down at 	the bar. There's a normal-sized crowd at Quark's 	tonight, but even here the mood is more subdued than 	usual.					NOG				(sarcastic) 			Thanks for the invitation, Jake. 			That was a lot of fun.	But Jake is too worried about his father to even 	respond to the sarcasm.					JAKE 			Did you see how down my dad was? 			He was trying to hide it, but I 			could tell he's really depressed.					NOG 			He's not the only one. Look 			around -- there's something in the 			air. People are scared.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - TEASER       5.5    CONTINUED:					JAKE 			Yeah, but my dad's usually the one 			who tries to lift everyone's 			spirits. I mean, people go to him 			for encouragement. Where does he 			go when he's depressed? Who lifts 			his spirits?	There's no answer to that and the boys sit there in 	silence a moment. QUARK moves over to them.					QUARK 			I hope I'll be seeing both of you 			here tomorrow at twelve hundred 			hours.					NOG 			Why?					QUARK 			Why? Haven't you heard? There's 			going to be an auction of some of 			the galaxy's rarest and most 			valuable antiquities.	Quark grabs a PADD from under the bar and hands it to 	Nog.					QUARK 			Here, find something you like and 			make a bid with all that latinum 			you have stashed under your bed.					NOG				(looks around) 			Shh!      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - TEASER       6.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK 			Oh, Nog. You don't really keep it 			under your bed?					NOG				(tight) 			No, of course not.	Nog begins looking through the items on the PADD. Jake 	glances over out of curiosity.					JAKE 			Where'd you get all this stuff, 			Quark?					QUARK 			I'm just conducting the auction --			for a modest commission. The 			items up for sale were aboard an 			old derelict freighter the 			Bajorans found adrift about a 			light year from here.				(selling it again) 			The cargo hold was crammed with 			valuables of every description --			antiques, paintings, vehicles...					NOG			It's all a bunch of junk.	Quark glares at him, but Nog pays him no mind.					NOG				(to Jake) 			Listen to some of this stuff: mid-			twenty-fourth century ceramic 			Romulan water basin -- slightly 			cracked; a pair of Tellerite shoes -- 			date unknown; a mid-twentieth 			century Hew-mon baseball card; a 			Tholian pedestal of--	Jake suddenly snatches the PADD out of Nog's hand.					JAKE 			A baseball card!				(reads PADD) 			"A mint condition nineteen fifty-			one Willie Mays rookie card." Nog 			this is it!      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - TEASER       7.5    CONTINUED:	(3)					NOG 			What do you mean?					JAKE 			It's perfect! This is how I can 			cheer up my Dad! You know how 			much he loves baseball -- he'll go			nuts when he sees this.					QUARK 			Just tell him to be here at twelve 			hundred hours and he can bid along 			with--					JAKE 			No -- I'm. going to bid on this. 			He's always doing things for me, 			I want to do something for him 			for a change.				(looking down at card) 			And this is it. All I have to do 			is get him this card. How hard 			could that be?	PUSH IN on the picture of the Willie Mays Baseball card 	on the PADD...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT ONE      8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)6    EXT.

Jake 	is just as determined to get the diminutive Ferengi 	cadet to bend.					NOG 			No.					JAKE 			Come on, Nog...					NOG 			No.					JAKE 			Why not?					NOG 			It's my money, Jake. If you want 			to bid at this auction, use your 			own money.					JAKE 			I'm Human, I don't have any money.					NOG 			It's not my fault that your 			species decided to abandon 			currency-based economics in favor 			of some philosophy of self-			enhancement.					JAKE				(defensive) 			Hey, watch it. There's nothing 			wrong with our philosophy.				(with pride) 			We work to better ourselves and 			the rest of Humanity.					NOG				(confused) 			What does that mean exactly?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT ONE      9.7    CONTINUED:					JAKE			It means...				(reaching)			... it means we don't need money.					NOG 			Well if you don't need money, then 			you certainly don't need mine.					JAKE 			How much latinum do you have?				(beat) 			How much?					NOG 			Five bars.					JAKE 			Five bars!					NOG 			Look, it's taken me a lifetime to 			save that much money. I'm not 			going to just throw it away for 			some stupid baseball card.	Jake pauses, then moves in for the kill.					JAKE				(quiet and contemptuous) 			Not even for my father -- the man 			who made it possible for you to 			enter Starfleet Academy?					NOG 			That's not fair...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT ONE     10.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					JAKE			... the man who believed in you 			when no one else would.					NOG 			This is so low!					JAKE 			I can't believe you would rather 			keep your filthy money locked away 			in a box under your bed, than use 			it to give him endless moments of 			happiness.					NOG 			AGHHHH!!				(exhausted, defeated) 			All right, all right. I'll do it.					JAKE 			That's very generous, Nog. I'm 			proud of you.

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Sisko is pacing in his office, trying to prepare 	himself for whatever this meeting with the Kai is going 	to bring him. The door CHIMES and Sisko braces himself 	before answering.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT ONE    10A.9    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			Come in.	Kira escorts KAI WINN into the room. There are Two 	N.D.

So often on these visits, I 			find myself confined to meeting 			rooms or guest quarters. I love 			to see the Promenade and mingle 			with the residents of the station. 			Would you mind?	Sisko is surprised and has no idea where she's going 	with this, but...					SISKO 			Not at all.	He indicates the door and they EXIT together.									CUT TO:10   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	Sisko and Kai Winn take a stroll along the Promenade. 	The N.D. Vedeks follow at a discreet distance. A few 	heads turn as they pass through the crowd, but people 	are polite enough to leave them alone for the most 	part. The Kai seems completely at ease, engaging in 	small talk, while Sisko is still waiting for the other 	shoe to drop.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT ONE     12.10   CONTINUED:	Winn sees a closed up shop down on the First Level.					KAI WINN 			There was a shop down there as I 			recall -- a woman who sold Bajoran 			tapestries and antiques.					SISKO			Kandra Vilk.

I'm sure there are times 			when you must feel as though 			you're being abandoned here.	Sisko isn't sure if there's a mocking tone here or not. 	But in any case, he's had enough fencing for one 	afternoon and he lets an edge creep into his voice.					SISKO 			Forgive me Eminence, but I have a 			very busy day ahead of me...					KAI WINN 			I'm here to meet with a 			representative of the Dominion.					SISKO 			To what end?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT ONE     13.10   CONTINUED:	(2)					KAI WINN 			I don't know.

The Dominion is 			notorious for its... political 			intrigue.					KAI WINN				(dry)			I have some experience in that 			area as well.				(beat)			This is a very delicate moment for 			Bajor. The conflict between the 			Federation and the Dominion could 			escalate into open warfare at any 			moment. A misstep now could 			result in the destruction of our 			world.

QUARK'S	The auction is underway. The dabo wheel has been	removed and in its place is a table for items to be 	displayed and a lectern where Quark serves as 	auctioneer. The room is filled with seated N.D. Aliens 	and Humans, all of whom have PADDS or other reference 	guides. There are Bajoran Security Guards in evidence, 	but it's an orderly crowd. Jake and Nog have a seat 	near the front, and they're impatiently waiting for 	their lot to come up. Quark is just wrapping up the 	auction of a bizarre alien sculpture. The bidding is 	down to a Klingon woman and a Bolian man.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT ONE     15.11   CONTINUED:					QUARK				(to Bolian)			... the bid is to you, sir -- one 			bar, three strips.	The Bolian thinks it over.					QUARK				(continuing) 			Don't let the lady steal this fine 			example of post-eventualistic, pre-			Matoian, bronze and triptin 			sculpture for such a pittance.	The Bolian finally nods.					QUARK			One bar, three strips.				(to Klingon) 			One bar, four strips, and it's all 			yours. An honorable addition to 			any Klingon household.				(she doesn't look				convinced)			And remember -- all the proceeds			from this auction go to the			Bajoran War Orphans' Fund, minus			a modest commission. Think of			those poor, lonely children... and			how much your money would mean to			them.	Finally, the Klingon woman shakes her head no.					QUARK			Looks like the kids'll have to 			make do with one bar, three 			strips. Sold to the blue man in 			the good shoes.	The sculpture is removed from the table by a pair of 	Ferengi waiters. Another pair of waiters then place an 	ornate CHEST on the table. They open the chest and 	display the contents in front of it.12   CLOSE ON TABLE	As the WILLIE MAYS BASEBALL CARD, in a protective 	holder, is carefully set before the chest.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT ONE     16.13   WIDER 	As Jake and Nog exchange a glance -- this is it!

Well, we are very much 			alone now.					SISKO			Even though you're not a member of 			the Federation, Starfleet is 			committed to the protection of 			your world. We will not stand 			idly by and watch the Dominion 			conquer Bajor.					KAI WINN 			Can you promise me that you will 			not let one Jem'Hadar soldier set 			foot on Bajor? Can you promise me 			that you will use the entire fleet 			to protect our planet even if it 			means sacrificing other worlds... 			like Vulcan or Andor or Berengaria 			or perhaps Earth itself?	Sisko can't go that far, but it kills him to admit it.					SISKO 			I can't make that kind of promise.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Cards" - REV. 04/15/97 - ACT THREE    37.22A  CONTINUED:					KAI WINN 			I wouldn't believe you if you 			did.				(beat) 			I think you can see my 			predicament.

How do I save Bajor?	Sisko struggles for a moment, has to find some answer.					SISKO 			You want my advice -- then this is 			it. Stall. Tell Weyoun you have 			to consult with the Council of 			Ministers, or that you have to 			meditate on your response, 			anything you want, but you have to 			stall for time.					KAI WINN 			Time for what?					SISKO			I don't know. But I do know that 			the moment of crisis isn't here 			yet.

She moves to 	him and grabs his ear and stares into his eyes, 	searching for an answer. After a beat, she releases 	him.					KAI WINN 			Very well, Emissary... we will put 			ourselves into your hands. May we 			all walk with the Prophets.	And after placing this huge burden squarely on Sisko's 	shoulders, she EXITS.
