WARDROOM	CLOSE ON an ominous and eerie-looking stone Obelisk 	bathed in an unearthly light. WE SLOWLY PULL BACK, 	REVEALING various Bajorans in long, flowing robes, 	reverently surrounding the very tall and impressive 	slab. Behind them, a fountain. WE KEEP PULLING BACK 	to see that the Obelisk is in the middle of a kind of 	agora -- a town square of an ancient Bajoran city.					DAX (O.S.)			That's it?	WE CONTINUE TO PULL BACK, finally revealing this to be 	a very detailed and "realistic" eighteen-by-twelve-inch 	painting on a weathered piece of parchment.					SISKO (O.S.)			That's it. The "City of B'hala," 			painted nearly twenty thousand 			years ago --2    WIDER	to include SISKO, KIRA and DAX staring at the ancient 	painting which has been pulled out of its own elaborate	shipping crate by TWO BAJORAN SECURITY AGENTS. Sisko 	eyes the painting with tremendous appreciation.					DAX			Hmm.	Sisko and Kira exchange a look, taken aback by her "hmm."					KIRA 			Jadzia -- you're looking at the 			most important Bajoran icon ever 			painted. The only known "proof" 			that B'hala actually existed, and 			all you have to say is "hmm"?					DAX			No, it's just that you both gave 			it such a build up that I thought 			it would be a lot...         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED:					DAX (Cont'd)				(delineating a larger 				imaginary canvas)			... bigger.	Sisko and Kira give her a look. Dax tries to recover 	with:					DAX			Not that small is bad.					KIRA 			We've been trying to force the 			Cardassian government to return 			this to us since the end of the 			Occupation. It's good to have it 			back.					DAX			I thought you said it was being 			returned to the State Museum in 			Ilvia.					SISKO			It will be. Tomorrow. But I 			couldn't let it pass without 			stealing a look.				(with a half-smile)			Sometimes, being the Emissary 			isn't such a bad thing.	As Dax looks at the painting once again, Sisko can't 	contain his enthusiasm.					SISKO				(pointing to the 				Obelisk)			See that? It's a Bantaca spire. 			Ancient Bajoran cities were built 			around them.	Sisko marvels at the structure.					SISKO			They were all about eleven meters 			tall... made of hundreds of 			stones, carved and fitted together 			so tightly that they didn't need mortar.					KIRA 			It's said they mark the city's 			place in the cosmos.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - TEASER        2A.2  CONTINUED:	(2)	Considering Sisko's and Kira's enthusiasm for the 	piece, Dax feels "obligated" to say something 	appreciative. Referring to the odd-looking symbols on 	the obelisk, she comments:					DAX			Beautiful markings.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - TEASER         3.3    CLOSE ON THE PAINTING					SISKO (O.S.)			Supposedly, they're coordinates of 			the lost city.4    RESUME					SISKO			But since we can't see the 			markings on the other two sides, 			they're impossible to decipher.					KIRA 			Which is why B'hala is likely to 			remain lost.	The captain turns to the two Guards.					SISKO				(re: the painting)			Before you pack it up, have it 			scanned into the computer.					DAX				(smiling)			You're going to study it? Maybe 			try to find the lost city?	Kira stares at Sisko, lost in thought for a moment. 	Sisko notices her faraway look, and asks:					SISKO			I wouldn't get my hopes up, major. 			I just like it. I want a copy for 			my office.					KIRA 			I was just thinking about Zocal's 			third prophecy. It says that only 			someone touched by the Prophets 			could find the ruins of B'hala.					DAX				(to Sisko)			No pressure.	Sisko shoots her a glance before we cut to --5    EXT.

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)	Sisko is alone, reading a PADD, relaxing. In the b.g., 	a reproduction of the painting is being displayed on 	the wall MONITOR.6A   CLOSE ON SISKO (OPTICAL)	as he pauses from his reading to glance up at the 	painting. From his expression, it's clear he's very 	pleased with his new acquisition. Sisko momentarily 	goes back to his reading, but after only a beat, he 	stares back at the painting.	Sisko puts the PADD down and stands to "soak it in," 	like a painter taking a few steps back to examine the 	work from a distance. Sisko smiles to himself -- 	there's something about this work of art that speaks to 	him. Sisko is about to return to his reading, when 	something in the painting catches his eye --	Sisko steps up to examine it more closely.7    CLOSE ON THE PAINTING (OPTICAL)	as Sisko's fingers run from the Obelisk to an aqueduct 	that empties into a fountain behind the Obelisk. Sisko 	takes a long beat as he studies this carefully. Then:					SISKO			Computer, magnify grid C-four.	The section of the painting where the aqueduct water 	spills into the fountain is outlined, and then "popped" 	forward so that it fills the screen. We see the back 	of one side of the Obelisk crudely reflected in the 	water.					SISKO (O.S.)				(to himself)			A reflection...				(to the computer)			Now magnify D-two.	The computer repeats the process, outlining only the 	wall of water falling into the fountain. The image of 	the markings has been amplified so much that it is 	quite "grainy" and impressionistic -- a sea of shapes 	and shadows.8    CLOSE ON SISKO	as he peers hard at the image on the screen. After a 	long beat considering something, Sisko moves over to 	his console, pushes a button and removes an isolinear rod.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - TEASER        4A.9    INT. HOLOSUITE	Sisko is standing near an open console in an empty 	holosuite. He inserts the isolinear rod into the 	console then addresses the computer:					SISKO			Computer. Process Sisko image 			file three-seven-six. Reduce in 			size seventy-five percent.	Sisko turns to see --         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - TEASER         5.10   ANGLE OVER SISKO'S SHOULDER (OPTICAL)	We watch as the Holosuite completes the replica of the 	Obelisk. The four-sided stone structure has a three 	foot base and extends fifteen feet into the air. The 	two sides facing Sisko have the same "markings" as the painting.11   ON SISKO (OPTICAL)	as he looks at the Obelisk with a deep fascination. 	After a moment of "soaking in" the structure, he 	circles its base to face the two blank sides of the 	Obelisk. He stares at the clean slates for a moment, 	then:					SISKO			Superimpose grid D-Two.	The image reflected in the wall of water is "projected" 	onto one of the two blank faces of the Obelisk. The 	sea of shapes and shadows has a loose fit on the 	structure. If these are "markings" of any kind, they 	remain indecipherable.					SISKO			Reverse image and enhance.	The "markings" come somewhat into sharper focus. Sisko 	has indeed found something. Sisko stares excitedly at 	the mysterious shapes.									DISSOLVE TO:11A  ON SISKO (OPTICAL)	continuing to work. The "markings" on the third face 	of the Obelisk have now come into perfect focus. But 	the fourth side remains blank. The moment is 	interrupted by QUARK, ENTERING.					QUARK				(sheepish)			Sorry to disturb you, Captain,			but...					SISKO				(annoyed)			But what?					QUARK			It's after three in the morning.	Sisko hadn't realized how late it was.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - TEASER         6.11A  CONTINUED:					SISKO			Three, already?					QUARK			Time flies when you're having fun.					SISKO				(rubbing his tired eyes)			Quark -- I want you to save this 			program for me.	Quark looks at the structure curiously.					QUARK			What is it?					SISKO			An ancient puzzle.	Quark continues eyeing the structure, seeing nothing 	special about it.					QUARK			You know, Captain, if you like 			puzzles -- I have a wide 			assortment of pleasure mazes.				(suggestively)			And they all come with a surprise 			in the center.					SISKO			Never mind, Quark. I'll save the 			program myself.12   CLOSE ON SISKO	as he steps up to the console and taps a few keys. As 	he reaches to extract the isolinear rod, something 	shorts in the system -- he is showered with SPARKS and 	thrown to the ground, unconscious.13   QUARK (OPTICAL)	rushes to the captain's side as BLUE ARCS DANCE all 	over Sisko's body.					QUARK			Quark to Infirmary -- medical 			emergency in Holosuite Four.	And on a CLOSE ANGLE of Sisko, we:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - ACT ONE         7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)14   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	ODO is hauling Quark down the corridor, gripping the 	Ferengi by the collarbone.					QUARK			But Odo -- you said yourself the 			Captain's all right.					ODO			Lucky for you.	Quark can't believe the injustice being committed 	against him.					QUARK			Then why am I being arrested? I 			already told you it was an 			accident. A minor technical 			difficulty. You can't arrest 			somebody for a minor technical 			difficulty.					ODO			No, but I can arrest you for 			negligence. Your own records show 			your holosuites are in desperate 			need of maintenance.					QUARK			Which is what I've been telling 			Chief O'Brien for the past week. 			I begged him to have Rom repair 			them. But you know what he said? 			"Rom's too busy upgrading the 			sensor array." Can you believe 			that? Anyone can fix a sensor 			array. But no one can fix the 			holosuites like that idiot brother 			of mine.				(an idea)			So you see, if anyone should be 			arrested for negligence, it's 			Chief O'Brien.					ODO			Tell it to the magistrate.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - ACT ONE         8.14   CONTINUED:	Odo continues hauling the Ferengi towards Security. As 	Odo and Quark pass the Infirmary, WE HOLD on the 	entrance.15   INT. INFIRMARY	DOCTOR BASHIR emerges from the laboratory/dispensary 	area, his attention completely focused on the readings 	off a medical instrument. Sisko is on the bio-bed.					BASHIR			... There are no signs of any 			permanent neural damage, though I 			am reading some odd synaptic 			potentials.				(a beat)			Let me ask you something -- does 			my uniform look a little brighter 			to you?					SISKO			Yes... everything does.	Sisko looks around the room.					SISKO			Colors seem more intense... and 			shapes are more... focused.	Sisko looks at his own hand as if held never seen it 	before.					BASHIR			That's called post-neural shock 			syndrome. Your neural pathways 			were overloaded by the plasma 			burst. All external stimuli are 			going to seem more pronounced.				(a warning)			It'll take a while for things to 			settle down. I'm putting you on 			restricted duty for the next three 			days. If you experience any other 			side effects, headaches, nausea, 			dizziness... let me know 			immediately.	Sisko is relishing his senses -- looking intently at a 	bright green liquid in a vial.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - ACT ONE         9.15   CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(with a smile)			In the meantime, enjoy the show.	Sisko catches himself, putting down the vial.16   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS	Sisko and Jake have just completed a dinner Jake made 	for his father.					JAKE 			So... did dinner get the Sisko 			stamp of approval?	Sisko's attention is focused on a dessert tray of fruit 	and cheeses. He's using a knife to "doodle" with the 	sliced fruit, cutting them into various odd shapes and 	symbols. Jake watches him, trying to gauge his mood.					SISKO			Grandpa would be proud of you.					JAKE			I was a little worried I 			overcooked the Lingta roast. I'm 			glad you liked it.	Sisko nods, still absorbed.					JAKE 			Can I get you anything else?					SISKO			I'm fine.					JAKE			I guess you'll be cooking tomorrow 			night.	Sisko is still not paying much attention to the conversation.					SISKO			Why's that?					JAKE				(hopeful)			To welcome Kasidy back to the 			station. Maybe prepare some of 			that jambalaya she likes so much.					SISKO			We'll see.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - ACT ONE        10.16   CONTINUED:					JAKE			Dad, Kasidy's spent six months in 			prison for helping the Maquis -- 			she's paid for what she did.					SISKO				(neutral)			I suppose so.	Jake gets up and begins clearing the table. His 	father's lack of interest in Kasidy really bothers him, 	though he tries not to show it.					JAKE			I hope you'll give her a chance... 			that's all. You two had 			something...	But Sisko doesn't respond. He's lost in deep 	concentration, staring at the odd shapes formed by the 	pieces of fruit and rind.					JAKE 			Dad?	No answer.					JAKE 			Dad -- what is it?					SISKO			These shapes...17   CLOSE ON THE FRUIT PLATE					SISKO (O.S.)			... I know what they are.								MATCH CUT TO:18   INT. HOLOSUITE	The same shapes now superimposed onto the fourth side 	of the Obelisk. We now understand that the shapes 	Sisko saw in the fruit are the missing "markings." 	Sisko excitedly walks around the Obelisk -- marveling 	that all four sides are now "complete."	Sisko stares at the mysterious markings, his mind 	racing through the possibilities. A COM VOICE 	interrupts:        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - ACT ONE        11.18   CONTINUED:				DAX'S COM VOICE			Ops to Captain Sisko.					SISKO			Go ahead.					DAX'S COM VOICE			Sorry to disturb you, Benjamin. 			But I have Admiral Whatley calling 			from Starfleet Headquarters.	Despite Sisko's preference to keep working, he knows he 	can't keep an Admiral waiting.					SISKO			I'll take it in here.	Sisko puts down his instruments and takes a few steps 	over to the monitor in the Holosuite.19   ANGLE ON THE MONITOR (OPTICAL)	as it comes to life with the image of ADMIRAL CHARLIE 	WHATLEY. The Admiral is "old-Navy" -- a strong-willed 	and seasoned veteran of many campaigns. He has 	intelligent, steel-hard eyes that don't miss much.					WHATLEY			Hello, Ben.					SISKO			Admiral.					WHATLEY			How've you been?					SISKO			Never better.					WHATLEY			Glad to hear it. I know you've 			been waiting for this news a long 			time. I'm glad to be the one who 			tells you.	Sisko waits expectantly.					WHATLEY			Bajor's petition to join the 			Federation has been approved.	Sisko breaks into a wide grin -- this is great news.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - ACT ONE        12.19   CONTINUED:					SISKO			It's about time.					WHATLEY			Congratulations, Ben. You've done 			a helluva job out there.					SISKO			Thank you.					WHATLEY			We're not the only ones who think 			so. The Bajorans requested that 			the signing ceremony take place on 			your station. So make sure you 			spruce up that floating bicycle 			wheel of yours.				(smiling)			Count on me and a lot of other 			brass showing up for this one, 			captain... or should I say 			admiral? That can't be far away			once you have this feather in your 			cap.	Sisko nods, smiling at the compliment.20   INT. QUARK'S BAR	Quark is standing amidst a happy Bajoran throng on the 	first level. He's looking up at TWO DABO GIRLS holding 	a rolled-up banner over the balcony, waiting for his 	cue.					QUARK 			Computer, spotlight.	A single beam of SPOTLIGHT shines on the two Dabo Girls.					QUARK 			Drumroll.	And as the computer PIPES IN the traditional DRUMROLL, 	Quark cues the Dabo Girls to unfurl the banner. Quark 	immediately turns to face WORF and Dax, wanting to see 	their reactions.					WORF				(reading the banner)			Welcome Klingons.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rapture" - REV. 10/23/96 - ACT ONE        13.20   CONTINUED:	The crowd's confused silence confirms Worf's words. 	Quark spins to look at the banner -- the Klingon emblem 	is surrounded with some Klingon writing. Quark winces 	with agony and yells up to the Dabo Girls:					QUARK			Not that one --	Quark rushes behind the bar, pulls out another banner 	and unfurls it over the counter. This one has the 	United Federation of Planets emblem and when the crowd 	sees it, they break out into the traditional Bajoran 	APPLAUSE.					DAX			I see you're prepared for 			anything.					QUARK			Never hurts.	Dax picks up a glass with the U.F.P. emblem emblazoned 	on its side.					DAX				(to Quark)			I take it you think Federation 			membership is going to be good for			business?					QUARK			Of course it is -- this station is 			going to get busier than an 			Alvanian beehive. I'm expecting 			to do five times the volume in 			root beer alone.	Quark smiles... he's got this all worked out.					QUARK			You see, it's all about foot 			traffic. The more people come in, 			the more they drink.
