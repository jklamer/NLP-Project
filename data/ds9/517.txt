SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	An alien transport ship approaches the station.2    INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR	KIRA, DAX, and WORF walk together down the corridor. 	Kira seems excited about something and is giving some 	last minute instructions to Worf and Dax. (We may not 	notice it right away, but she's wearing her Cardassian 	bracelet from "SECOND SKIN.")					KIRA 			I want him treated like a visiting 			head of state. Full 			communications and computer 			access, any kind of assistance he 			might need from the station's 			crew...					DAX				(playful) 			You should've let us know he was 			coming sooner. I think we've got 			a red carpet in storage somewhere.	But Kira's in no mood for jokes.					KIRA 			Dax, this is important. Tekeny 			Ghemor led the dissident movement 			against Cardassia's Central 			Command. And now that Dukat and 			the Dominion have taken over, 			there's no one better qualified to 			lead the opposition.					DAX			Besides... he's practically your 			father.	Worf looks surprised. That's a new one on him.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood... " - REV. 2/14/97 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:					WORF				(to Kira) 			Your father? Isn't Ghemor a 			Cardassian?	They reach the airlock and wait for Ghemor.					KIRA			It's a long story.					DAX			The Cardassians once kidnapped 			Kira and surgically altered her to 			look like Ghemor's missing 			daughter.	Worf looks puzzled.					KIRA			It was part of a plan to expose 			him as the leader of the dissident 			movement.					WORF				(with disapproval) 			Cardassian politics are very... 			complex.					DAX			I think they like it that way.					KIRA			Ghemor may be the only hope left 			for Cardassia. He deserves our 			help.	Just then, Ghemor's Voice can be heard coming from the 	airlock.					GHEMOR'S VOICE 			That's a lot of faith to put in 			one man.	Kira and the others turn to see TEKENY GHEMOR emerging 	from the airlock, carrying a travel bag. Ghemor's an 	older, distinguished-looking Cardassian dressed in 	civilian clothes. He looks a little more frail than 	the last time we saw him (in "SECOND SKIN") but his 	face lights up when he sees Kira.					GHEMOR 			I hope I won't prove too great a 			disappointment.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood... " - REV. 2/14/97 - TEASER     3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			Legate Ghemor. It's good to see 			you.	Ghemor smiles as he puts down his bag. It's weight 	seems to be bothering him.					GHEMOR 			How many times do I have to tell 			you, Nerys? If you won't call me 			"father," Tekeny will do.					KIRA			Welcome to Deep Space Nine... 				(with fondness) 			Tekeny. This is our science 			officer, Lieutenant Commander Dax, 			and our strategic operations 			officer, Lieutenant Commander 			Worf.					GHEMOR 			Quite an impressive reception for 			an old man.	Ghemor notices the bracelet Kira's wearing and smiles.					GHEMOR 			You're wearing the bracelet I gave 			you.	Kira glances at the bracelet, slightly embarrassed.					KIRA 			It's... not exactly permitted 			under the uniform code... but...					GHEMOR 			It looks good on you.	Suddenly Ghemor looks tired, like he's been pushing 	himself a little too hard and has ran out of gas. He 	turns to Dax and Worf.					GHEMOR 			It's been a pleasure meeting both 			of you. But if you'll excuse me, 			I'm afraid the journey here was a 			little... draining.					KIRA			I'll show you to your quarters.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood...

And if he 	leans on her a little as they EXIT, she doesn't really 	notice.3    CLOSE ON WORF AND DAX	Worf watches Kira go, amazed.					WORF 			Major Kira, friends with a 			Cardassian. It seems wrong.					DAX				(agreeing) 			You should've known her five years 			ago. Back then, I never thought 			she'd be friends with anyone.4    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.5    INT. GHEMOR'S QUARTERS	Kira is showing Ghemor around his guest quarters.					KIRA			I've had the replicator programmed 			with a complete Cardassian menu. 			You've got twenty-six-hour-a-day 			computer access and a private 			subspace com channel. And if 			there's anything else you need, 			just let me know.	Ghemor takes a seat. He looks tired.					GHEMOR			I wish I had your energy.	Kira realizes she's been a little hyper.					KIRA			I'm sorry. I wanted you to feel 			at home.					GHEMOR 			You've been very kind.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood... " - REV. 2/14/97 - TEASER     5.5    CONTINUED:	Kira's got some bad news. She's not sure how to break 	it to Ghemor, but she figures she may as well get it 	over with.					KIRA 			I thought you should know... I 			checked with Bajoran Security. 			They still don't have any leads on 			your daughter.					GHEMOR 			She's dead, isn't she?					KIRA			We don't know that. If Iliana's 			still alive, she's been undercover 			on Bajor for over a decade. It's 			not easy to find someone who's 			been hiding that long.	But Ghemor's lost hope. He shakes his head.					GHEMOR 			I know you're trying to keep my 			hopes up, but it's time I faced 			the facts. I'm alone. You're the 			closest thing to family I have 			left.					KIRA			Bajoran Security hasn't given up 			yet. And neither should you. You 			just have to be patient.	A melancholy expression crosses Ghemor's face.					GHEMOR 			I'm afraid patience is for the 			young.	But Ghemor doesn't want to dwell on the negatives. He 	changes the subject.					GHEMOR 			What about you, Nerys? How is 			life treating you?	Kira tries to be up for Ghemor's sake.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood... " - REV. 2/14/97 - TEASER     6.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA 			I've got no complaints.				(tries to give him 				something positive to 				focus on) 			Did you read the proposal I sent 			you?	Ghemor nods.					GHEMOR 			It was very... ambitious. But I'm 			afraid you'll have to find another 			person to lead the effort.					KIRA				(surprised) 			But you're the best person for the 			job. You're still popular on 			Cardassia... people respect 			you... they'll listen to you.	Ghemor can't help but smile.					GHEMOR 			It's not that simple.					KIRA			We can make it work. We'll set up 			a government in exile here on the 			station. You can make regular 			transmissions into Cardassia, 			issue corrections to their 			propaganda, mobilize your old 			friends in the dissident 			movement...					GHEMOR				(stopping her) 			Nerys...	Ghemor looks tired. He has something on his mind, but 	he'd hoped not to have to talk about it so soon.					GHEMOR 			It's a good plan. But I can't 			help you.					KIRA			Why?	Ghemor realizes he has no choice but to tell the truth.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood...

INFIRMARY (OPTICAL)	BASHIR is examining an MRI-like scan of Ghemor's	internal organs while Kira and Ghemor look on.					BASHIR				(wishing he had better 				news) 			I'm afraid the prognosis isn't 			good.				(to Ghemor) 			The disease has already spread 			throughout your digestive tract, 			your circulatory and respiratory 			systems, your cartilaginous 			tissue...	This only confirms what Ghemor already suspected. He 	winces as a sharp stabbing pain shoots through his 	insides.					GHEMOR 			How much time do I have left?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood... " - REV. 2/14/97 - ACT ONE     9. 6   CONTINUED:	Bashir's not about to admit defeat.					BASHIR 			I'm not sure. There're still some 			procedures we can try. Hexadrin 			therapy. Or immunoregeneration 			treatments.					GHEMOR 			I appreciate anything you can do.	Ghemor turns to Kira. The pain's still pretty intense.					GHEMOR			I'm sorry, Nerys. I know this 			isn't going the way you planned.6A   CLOSE ON KIRA 	She's having a hard time adjusting to what's happening, 	but she tries to stay strong for Ghemor.					KIRA 			Don't worry about me. The 			important thing is to get you 			well.	Ghemor nods, but without any enthusiasm. He knows 	there isn't much hope of that.7    EXT.

Finally he speaks out loud, to the air.					SISKO			Begin Captain's log, Stardate...	Just then...					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE 			Ops to Sisko.	Sisko stops.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood...

He's "demanding" 			to speak to you. 9   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Sisko nods. He's been half expecting this.					SISKO 			Put him through.10   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	To include the wall monitor, which activates to reveal 	GUL DUKAT, sitting at a desk, with a Cardassian and a 	Jem'Hadar bodyguard looming ominously behind him.					DUKAT 			Captain Sisko. Always a pleasure.					SISKO			Still calling yourself "Gul" 			Dukat? I'm surprised you haven't 			promoted yourself back to Legate 			by now.					DUKAT 			I prefer the title "gul."  Much 			more hands-on than legate. And 			less pretentious than any of the 			other alternatives... president... 			emperor... first minister... 			emissary...					SISKO			How about "Dominion Puppet?"	The eyes of the Cardassian Guard dart over to his 	Jem'Hadar companion, as if worried about a possible 	reaction, but neither Dukat nor the Jem'Hadar seem 	fazed by Sisko's remark.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood... " - REV. 2/14/97 - ACT ONE    11.10   CONTINUED:					DUKAT			Captain... such comments only 			reveal a deep misunderstanding of 			the intricacies of the Dominion 			political system. Under our new 			administration, Cardassia enjoys 			unparalleled autonomy and...	Sisko's had just about enough of this.					SISKO 			You can justify yourself later, 			Dukat. I'm a busy man.					DUKAT 			Humans. You have no appreciation 			for the fine art of conversation.	Sisko doesn't rise to the bait.					DUKAT 			Very well. We have reason to 			believe one of our citizens is 			aboard your station. A certain 			Tekeny Ghemor, formerly a Legate 			in the Cardassian Central Command.					SISKO 			And if we do?					DUKAT 			We want him back. To put it 			mildly, he has a lot to answer 			for.					SISKO			I'll take your request under 			advisement.				(a beat) 			But, considering the Federation 			doesn't recognize your 			"government" and that Cardassia 			has never agreed to an extradition 			treaty with Bajor or the 			Federation...				(smiles) 			I wouldn't get your hopes up.	Sisko cuts off the transmission, but he knows he hasn't 	heard the last of this.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood...

GHEMOR'S QUARTERS	Ghemor is walking back and forth across the room, 	carrying KIRAYOSHI.					GHEMOR				(baby talk, to 				Kirayoshi) 			What a beautiful baby you are. 			Yes.				(to Kira) 			You must be very proud.					KIRA			He's Miles and Keiko's baby. I 			only carried him to term for them.	Suddenly Ghemor stops in his tracks. He squeezes his 	eyes shut as he's hit by a wave of pain.					GHEMOR				(re: Kirayoshi) 			Maybe you'd better...	Kira carefully takes the baby away from Ghemor and puts 	him back in his bassinet. Ghemor sits down, still 	fighting the pain.					KIRA 			Are you...					GHEMOR 			It'll pass.	Ghemor looks at Kirayoshi with a bittersweet 	expression.					GHEMOR 			It's silly, but I almost feel like 			a grandfather. After all, you're 			the closest thing I have to a 			daughter...					KIRA				(smiles) 			And Yoshi is the closest thing I 			have to a son.				(trying to make him feel				better)			You'd make a terrific grandfather.	Ghemor tries to shake off his melancholy mood.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood...

Maybe with that Shakaar 			fellow of yours?					KIRA			You know about Shakaar and me?					GHEMOR 			I've been keeping an eye on you. 			It made me feel like I still had 			family.					KIRA				(more amused than angry) 			What did you do, hire someone to 			follow me around?					GHEMOR 			Credit an old man with some 			restraint. I just had people let 			me know when they heard anything 			about you. Like it or not, you're 			a public figure... the first 			officer of one of the most 			important military installations 			in the quadrant... Your feud with 			Kai Winn is already something of 			a legend.				(a beat) 			Did you know you have your own 			section in the Cardassian Central 			Archives?					KIRA			I guess I try not to think about 			it.					GHEMOR 			You've made an impression on 			people, Nerys. A good one. You 			should be proud of everything 			you've accomplished. I am.	There's a moment between them where they quietly 	acknowledge their connection. In a strange way, they 	really have become family.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood...

Opposing the Cardassian 			government is a dangerous 			business.					GHEMOR 			I enjoyed it, while it lasted. I 			have a fondness for hopeless 			causes.				(joking) 			It runs in the family.	Kira looks troubled. She has something she needs to 	tell Ghemor, but she doesn't want to upset him. 	Finally, she decides to give it a go.					KIRA 			Dukat called the station. He 			wants you extradited to Cardassia.	Ghemor nods his head. Held been expecting something 	like this, but that doesn't make it any easier. 	Dukat's trying to push him into one final fight, and he 	doesn't have the energy for it.					GHEMOR				(fighting another wave 				of pain) 			I'm not surprised. He knows as 			long as I'm still alive, I'm a 			threat to him.					KIRA 			We're not going to let him get his 			hands on you.	Ghemor nods. Suddenly he gets an idea. He looks up at 	Kira.					GHEMOR 			Nerys, I know more about the 			Cardassian government than anyone 			alive. Names, alliances, plots. 			Things that could do a lot of 			good, in the right hands.	Suddenly Ghemor is re-energized, despite his crippling 	pain.					GHEMOR 			There's a Cardassian tradition, 			called Shri-tal.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood...

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Kira's just finished telling Sisko about Ghemor's 	request.					SISKO 			I hate to sound callous... but 			we've got a tremendous opportunity 			here. Ghemor's basically 			volunteering to give us more 			intelligence on Cardassia than 			we've been able to gather in five 			years.					KIRA			That's exactly what he's doing.	Sisko can tell something's bothering Kira.					SISKO 			It's quite a responsibility he's 			handing you.					KIRA			I know. I can't help but wonder 			if he chose the right person. 			What if I become too involved... 			what if don't ask the right 			questions?				(a beat) 			Maybe I can convince Ghemor to 			talk to a counselor... or 			Constable Odo. He questions 			people every day.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ties of Blood... " - REV. 2/14/97 - ACT ONE   15A.14   CONTINUED:					SISKO 			Maybe. But Ghemor doesn't just 			want to be debriefed.

One of the Bajorans is 	Kira's old friend FUREL ("The Darkness and the Light"), 	looking younger and more robust than the last time we 	saw him.

She grabs the 	button and pushes it as quickly as she can. Ghemor 	relaxes a little.					KIRA			Better?	Ghemor nods, but it's clear he's still concentrating on 	containing the pain.					KIRA			Maybe I can get Doctor Bashir to 			give you something stronger.					GHEMOR 			No. Anything stronger and I'd be 			unconscious...
