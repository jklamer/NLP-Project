QUARK'S	The place is all but empty. The bored looking DABO	GIRLS stand listlessly at the tables, while the FERENGI 	WAITERS stand idle at the bar. The only customer seems 	to be MORN. As KIRA, WORF and DAX ENTER, QUARK rushes 	up to them solicitously.					QUARK			Welcome, welcome, welcome.					DAX				(looking around)			A little quiet in here...					QUARK				(as they're sitting)			You just beat the rush. Let me			get your orders before I get			swamped.	Kira, Worf and Dax exchange a shrug and decide to 	order.					DAX			I'll have a Tilamin Froth.					KIRA			And I'll have a --	A LOUD JACKHAMMER-LIKE NOISE cuts her off. After a 	table-rattling beat, it stops.					WORF			What was that?					QUARK				(all innocent)			What was what?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - TEASER        2.	CONTINUED:	They stare at him for a beat until another EARTH-	SHATTERING SOUND pierces the silence.					QUARK				(gesturing to the wall)			Oh, that? It's just my nephew and			Chief O'Brien repairing some			conduit.  You'll get used to it.	ANOTHER THUNDEROUS RATTLE.					WORF				(to the others)			The Klingon restaurant?					DAX			It would be quieter.	Kira, Worf and Dax get up from their chairs to leave. 	Before Quark can protest... NOG rushes out from the 	back of the room.					QUARK				(angrily at Nog)			When are you two going to be done			in there?					NOG			When the conduit is repaired and			brought back up to safety specs.					QUARK			Well, hurry up.	Quark looks over at Morn, who is shaking a finger in his 	ear as if to rid it of ringing.					QUARK				(continuing)			Before I lose all my customers.					NOG			I need to get something.					QUARK			What?					NOG			Two root beers?	Off Quark's face --        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - TEASER        3.2    INT. CONDUIT	CLOSE ON two empty root beer bottles. PULL BACK TO 	REVEAL O'BRIEN working at an open access panel. Nog is 	positioned behind O'Brien, next to a toolbox.					O'BRIEN 			Hyper spanner.	Like a nurse handing a surgeon a scalpel, Nog slaps the 	needed tool into O'Brien's open hand. O'Brien works 	for a beat, then extends his hand again.					O'BRIEN 			Optronic coupler.	Again, Nog slaps the needed tool into his hand.	O'Brien works for another beat, and extends a hand -- 	but before he can ask for the desired tool, Nog slaps 	it in his hand.					O'BRIEN				(surprised) 			How'd you know I needed a phase 			decompiler?					NOG			I've been paying attention, sir.					O'BRIEN				(smiling)			That you have, cadet.	As O'Brien returns to work:					NOG 			My father told me I could learn a 			lot from you. He says you can fix 			anything.					O'BRIEN			I'm an engineer... that's what we 			do.				(re: the completed work) 			There. Good as new.					NOG 			Amazing.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - TEASER        4.2    CONTINUED:	Suddenly there's a small EXPLOSION followed by a PLUME 	OF NITROGEN that spews from the open panel.					O'BRIEN			Damn.	And as he grabs a tool --3    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	O'Brien is reporting to SISKO as ODO looks on.					O'BRIEN 			We repaired the leak right away, 			but the problem is worse than I 			thought. The entire plasma 			distribution manifold is shot.					SISKO			Can you replicate a new one?					O'BRIEN				(shaking his head) 			No. Cardassian manifolds use a 			beta-matrix compositor which can't 			be replicated.					ODO				(dry) 			I suppose we could contact Gul 			Dukat and ask if he happens to 			have a spare manifold system lying 			around...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - TEASER        5.3    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			I'm sure he'd jump at the chance 			to help us. Any other ideas?					O'BRIEN 			We could send a salvage team to 			the abandoned Cardassian Station 			in the Trivas System.					SISKO			Empok Nor?					O'BRIEN				(nodding) 			It's the same design as this 			station. The Cardassians pulled 			out a year ago, but there's a good 			chance the plasma manifold system 			is still operable.					SISKO 				(to Odo) 			What about Dominion activity in 			the area?					ODO 			There hasn't been any in several 			months. Strategically, they seem 			to have lost interest in that 			sector.	Sisko thinks it over for a beat.					ODO 			But there is one problem. It's 			standard Cardassian procedure 			to booby-trap a facility before 			abandoning it.					O'BRIEN 			And a lot of the "surprises" they 			leave behind are specifically 			keyed to attack non-Cardassians.					SISKO			Sounds like you should take a 			Cardassian along...	And off Sisko's confident look        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - TEASER        6.4    INT. AIRLOCK	CLOSE ON GARAK, as he follows O'Brien toward the 	runabout, where four other crewmembers are loading 	supplies into the rear of the shuttle, preparing for 	departure. (We will later get to know them as 	STOLZOFF, PECHETTI, AMARO and BOQ'TA.)					O'BRIEN			So how did Captain Sisko convince 			you to come?					GARAK 			How do you know I didn't 			volunteer?					O'BRIEN			He threatened you, didn't he?					GARAK 			Nothing so coarse. The captain 			bribed me. He offered to help me 			procure a larger space for my 			workshop. The latest dressmaking 			equipment is surprisingly bulky.	O'Brien nods to his men as they pass and EXIT into --5    INT. RUNABOUT - CONTINUOUS	O'Brien and Garak move towards the cockpit.					O'BRIEN 			Well, whatever the captain did, 			I'm glad you're here.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - TEASER        7.5    CONTINUED:	Garak stiffens and stares at O'Brien for a beat.					O'BRIEN 			What's the matter?					GARAK			It's just that lately, I've 			noticed that everyone seems to... 			trust me. It's quite unnerving. 			I'm still trying to get used to 			it. Next thing I know, people 			will be inviting me to their homes 			for dinner.	Despite his protestations to the contrary, O'Brien can 	tell that Garak is somewhat pleased to be "settling in" 	to life on the station.					O'BRIEN 			If it makes you feel any better, 			I promise I'll never have you 			over.					GARAK, 			I appreciate that, Chief.					O'BRIEN 			Don't mention it. Anything to 			return the favor. Disarming 			Cardassian boobytraps is not my 			favorite kind of engineering.6    NEW ANGLE	At the door to the runabout, Boq'ta, a Bolian engineer, 	looks up from his work and turns to Pechetti, another 	engineer, human, in his mid-thirties.					BOQ'TA 			Booby-traps... I can't believe I 			let you talk me into volunteering 			for this.					PECHETTI 			Beats working on the waste 			extraction system.				(tapping his phaser) 			Besides, how often does an 			engineer get to wear a phaser?	Stolzoff and Amaro, the security officers, both human, 	exchange smiles. Stolzoff is female; Amaro is male. 	The security officers have phaser rifles, while the 	engineers, Boq'ta and Pechetti, have hand phasers.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - TEASER        8.6    CONTINUED:					STOLZOFF			Hate to disappoint you, Pechetti.				(re: phaser) 			But the only thing you'll be using 			that for is shooting voles. Empok 			Nor's been abandoned so long, 			they're going to be hungry.					AMARO 			Don't worry, you play with your 			wrenches, we'll watch your back.	Suddenly Nog ENTERS from the airlock, carrying a fully-	loaded backpack, two bulky canisters, a couple of 	canteen-like bottles strapped around his chest, and a 	phaser rifle.					AMARO 			Can I help you, cadet?	Appreciative CHORTLES from the others cause O'Brien to 	turn and look at them. Nog straightens himself with 	whatever dignity he can muster.					NOG				(to O'Brien) 			I'm reporting for duty...				(a defiant beat)			...sir.	O'Brien stands up to make a point.					O'BRIEN 			Welcome aboard, cadet.	Nog stands at attention.					NOG 			Thank you, sir. And may I say 			it's a privilege to be here, sir.					O'BRIEN				(for the others) 			You've earned it.				(then, only to Nog) 			But one more "sir" and I'm going 			to leave you behind.					NOG			Very well, s... Chief.	Satisfied that he's made his point and that Nog is to 	be respected, O'Brien turns back to the cockpit.					O'BRIEN 			Let's get going. Next stop, Empok 			Nor.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - TEASER        9.7    EXT.

RUNABOUT 	CLOSE ON a Cardassian board game we'll come to know as 	Kotra. It's a cross between chess and Stratego, where 	all the pieces are identical in shape, though each 	player's pieces are of a different color. A hand moves 	one of the pieces back, "retreating."					GARAK (O.S.) 			What are you doing?	WIDEN TO SEE the two players, Garak and Nog. 	O'Brien is nearby, at a side console, doing some recreational 	reading off a PADD. Boq'ta is piloting the runabout.					NOG 			Regrouping.					GARAK 			But you're losing.					NOG 			That's why I have to protect my 			assets.					GARAK 			This isn't a financial 			transaction. Protecting your 			"assets" is what got you into 			trouble in the first place. You 			have to go on the offensive -- you 			have to attack.	But Nog is committed to his own strategy.					NOG 			Your move.					GARAK			This is maddening. Asking a 			Ferengi to play a Cardassian game 			is like asking a Klingon to chew 			with his mouth closed.	Garak, exasperated, takes the octagonal dice and rolls. 	Garak moves a series of pieces brazenly as he speaks:       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - ACT ONE      10A.10   CONTINUED:					GARAK 			Kotra isn't about "regrouping" and 			hoarding "assets" -- it's about 			bold strategy and decisive action.	Garak has "taken" two of Nog's pieces, placing them in 	his "captured" tray.					GARAK 			Chief, care to take on the winner? 			I'd love to play Kotra against the 			hero of Setlik Three.	O'Brien looks over at him, reacting to this unexpected 	remark. Setlik is something that happened a long time 	ago, and it's not something he likes to think about.					O'BRIEN 			What is that supposed to mean?					GARAK 			Everyone knows your distinguished 			war record -- how you led two 			dozen men against the Barrica 			encampment and drove out an entire 			regiment of Cardassians. If you 			play Kotra with half that 			brazenness, I think we'd have 			quite a match.					O'BRIEN			That was a long time ago.					GARAK 			But you're still the same man.					O'BRIEN 			I'm not a soldier anymore. I'm an 			engineer.					GARAK 			I see. So when you and Doctor 			Bashir disappear into the 			holosuites for hours at a time... 			you're just repairing them.       DEEP SPACE NTNE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - ACT ONE       11.10   CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN			What's your point, Garak?					GARAK 			I'm just curious, why do you and 			Doctor Bashir spend hours in the 			holosuites dressed up as fighter 			pilots, reliving ancient battles?					O'BRIEN			We do it for fun -- it's just a 			game.					GARAK			So's Kotra. And I'd love nothing 			more than to play against a man 			like you.					O'BRIEN			Maybe some other time.	Pechetti emerges from the back room and steps up to 	O'Brien, handing him a PADD.					PECHETTI 			Chief, here's the wish list you 			wanted. Three categories: "Must 			Have"... which includes the 			manifolds and the plasma recoilers -- 			"Could Use"... things like EPS 			matrix converters -- and "Would be 			Nice"... bypass displacers, 			polarity maximizers, that sort of 			thing.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Empok Nor" - REV. 04/07/97 - ACT ONE       12.10   CONTINUED:	(3)					O'BRIEN				(reading an item on the				list) 			Cardassian emblems and insignias?					PECHETTI				(backing off) 			A low priority, but if we happen 			to see any...					O'BRIEN			This is a salvage operation, 			Pechetti. Not an opportunity to 			indulge your collecting 			obsessions.					PECHETTI				(contrite) 			Right.	Pechetti heads off to the back, and O'Brien smiles, 	shaking his head at the crewman.11   EXT.

Nog is now piloting the runabout, and although	there is little to do, he is doing it with great	concentration and pride. O'Brien is getting a cup of	coffee from the replicator.

There are probably 			pattern scramblers rigged to go 			off if they detect a non-			Cardassian transporter signal.					O'BRIEN 			That could be messy... we'll have 			to dock. The landing pads are 			sealed. Let's try an Upper Pylon.					NOG 			Won't the airlock have booby-traps?					GARAK			You can count on it.
