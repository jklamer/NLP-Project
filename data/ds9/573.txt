Now, let me see			Kira.	Bashir goes to the door and steps outside. There's	a beat, then KIRA ENTERS.

Maybe I'm being			selfish telling you all the			things I want, but... I don't			want the last thing I see to be a			look of pain in your eyes.					KIRA			You'd be surprised how well I can			hide my feelings when I need to.					ODO			Not from me.

What do they			have to do with this?					O'BRIEN			We believe they're responsible			for infecting Odo in the first			place.					SISKO			What!					BASHIR			We think Odo was infected three			years ago when he was supposedly			undergoing tests at Starfleet			Headquarters.					O'BRIEN			Evidently, Section Thirty-one			hoped that Odo would transmit the			disease to the others when he			linked with them.	Sisko has to take a moment to let that sink in.					SISKO			Genocide.				(beat)			Committed by people who call			themselves Federation citizens...				(beat)			Why didn't you tell me about this			earlier?					O'BRIEN			We felt that if we did --    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Extreme Measures" - REV. 04/05/99 - TEASER     7.3    CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR			The chief wanted to tell you, but			as senior officer, I ordered him			not to. It's my fault.					SISKO			I'm still waiting for an answer			to my question.					BASHIR			We have no proof. Besides... I			knew that if we told you what we			suspected, you'd feel an			obligation to report it to			Starfleet Command. And once you			did, Section Thirty-one would			most likely find out that we were			onto them and go even deeper into			hiding.					SISKO			What difference does that make?					BASHIR			There came a point where I had to			admit that my research was going			nowhere. I wasn't going to find			a cure in the lab. So, the chief			and I decided to look for it in			Section Thirty-one itself. A			few days ago, I sent a false			message to Starfleet Medical			announcing that I had found a			cure.					O'BRIEN			The idea is that when Thirty-one			hears about it, they'll want to			destroy Julian's research to			prevent it from falling into the			Dominion's hands.					SISKO			So you're trying to lure one of			their operatives to the station.			Okay, let's say it works.

I doubt they'll be very			cooperative.	Bashir and O'Brien exchange a look.					BASHIR			I've... managed to get my hands			on a Romulan memory scanner.					SISKO			Since they're illegal in the			Federation, I'll assume that's			another reason why you didn't			come to me.					BASHIR			Yes, sir.	Sisko takes a moment to let this all sink in.					SISKO			Setting aside the legal and			ethical issues involved... this			still seems like a long shot.					BASHIR			It is.
