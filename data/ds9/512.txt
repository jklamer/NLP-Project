SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.2    INT. ODO'S QUARTERS	At the moment, Odo's Quarters are in a state of 	transition. The humanoid style furniture (bed, chairs, 	etc.) have been pushed off to the side, waiting to be 	sent back to storage. Odo's changeling paraphernalia 	(the jungle gym, the sculptures, the various surfaces) 	are in piles in the middle of the room, waiting to be 	reassembled.	Odo surveys the jumbled furniture as KIRA ENTERS from 	the corridor with another armful of Odo's old 	changeling accoutrements.					KIRA			Where do you want me to put this?					ODO			Wherever you can find room.	Kira puts down the box of stuff next to a pile of 	furniture and other junk.					KIRA			I bet you can't wait to get all 			this put together so you can start 			shape-shifting around the room 			again.					ODO			I suppose. Though I did enjoy 			sleeping in a bed.					KIRA			Nothing's stopping you from 			sleeping in a bed if you want to.					ODO			Except that now when I'm asleep I 			have a tendency to revert to my 			gelatinous state and slide onto 			the floor.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's... " - REV. 12/04/96 - TEASER    2.2    CONTINUED:					ODO (Cont'd)				(his decision is final)			The bed goes. I'm a changeling, 			not a solid. No sense in 			pretending otherwise.	Kira looks at the remains of Odo's humanoid lifestyle.					KIRA			Then I guess we can send all this 			to storage.	Kira picks up some PADDS that are lying in the pile.					KIRA			What about these PADDS?	Before Odo can answer, the title of one of the PADDS 	catches Kira's eye.					KIRA				(reading it)			Finding and Winning your Perfect 			Mate by Doctor Jennings Rain?					ODO			I'll take that.	Kira gives Odo the PADD, but they're both clearly a 	little embarrassed and uncomfortable.					ODO				(feels he owes her an 				explanation)			I thought I was going to be a 			humanoid for the rest of my life, 			and... there were things...					KIRA			You don't have to explain, Odo.					ODO			I only read the first three 			chapters.					KIRA			Maybe you should finish it.					ODO			Why waste my time? Romance is for 			solids.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's... " - REV. 12/04/96 - TEASER    3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			You are solid... at least eighteen 			hours a day. I'm sure there're 			plenty of woman on this station 			who'd be interested in you if you 			gave them half a chance.	Odo's growing increasingly uncomfortable with the 	direction of this conversation.					ODO			I'll keep that in mind, major.				(changing the subject)			Right now I'd be satisfied just 			getting this room in order.	But before they can get back to work, the COM line 	activates.					DAX'S COM VOICE			Dax to Kira and Odo.					ODO			Yes, commander.					DAX'S COM VOICE			There's something we'd like you to 			look at in ops.					KIRA			On our way.	She EXITS. Odo looks at the PADD, which is still in	his hands, sighs, like it's a problem he will	eventually have to deal with, and puts it aside with	the things he's keeping. He EXITS.3    INT. OPS	Kira and Odo ENTER to find SISKO and DAX at Dax's 	station, looking at a readout.					SISKO 				(to Kira and Odo)			One of our listening posts in the 			Gamma Quadrant picked this up a 			few minutes ago.	Kira and Odo join them at Dax's station.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's... " - REV. 12/04/96 - TEASER    4.4    NEW ANGLE	To include the display, which shows a random assortment 	of binary code. Running below the binary numbers is a 	string of Cardassian symbols.					DAX			It looks like a Cardassian 			military code, but the computer 			doesn't recognize it.	Kira and Odo both study it for a second.					KIRA			It's Cardassian all right. But I			didn't think there were any 			Cardassians in the Gamma Quadrant.					SISKO			None that we know of.	Odo punches in a few commands. The stream of numbers 	and symbols doesn't change. Odo tries again, without 	success. He looks frustrated.					ODO			It's not Elgol-red. Or Fifth 			Order Military Encryption.					KIRA			Try Courier Code Five-Nine.	Odo punches in the commands. Still nothing.					ODO			Strange. Most Cardassian codes 			use a recursive encryption 			algorithm, but this has a 			completely different coding 			system.					KIRA			Bajoran Intelligence has had 			plenty of experience breaking 			Cardassian codes. Maybe we should 			send it to them.					DAX			We did. As soon as it came in. 			We still haven't heard from them.					ODO			It might take some time.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's... " - REV. 12/04/96 - TEASER   4A.4    CONTINUED:					SISKO			How much time? If someone's 			sending coded Cardassian messages 			from the Gamma Quadrant, I want to 			know what they're saying. Now.	Odo knows there's another option although he's 	reluctant to use it.					ODO			We do have an expert in Cardassian 			codes living on the station.	Sisko nods. He's not excited by his options either.					SISKO			Dax, get me Mister Garak.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's... " - REV. 12/04/96 - TEASER    5.4A EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.5    INT. REPLIMAT	GARAK sits down at a table, joining BASHIR and ZIYAL 	(Gul Dukat's half-Bajoran daughter). He seems very 	pleased with himself.					GARAK			Sorry for the interruption.					ZIYAL			How did it go?					GARAK			I'm afraid I disappointed them. 			I think they were hoping that 			message they picked up would 			contain the key to defeating the 			Dominion. You should've seen the 			looks on their faces when I told 			them it was a five-year old 			planetary survey report.					BASHIR				(surprised)			A planetary survey report.					GARAK			That's the look exactly.					BASHIR			I'd've thought you'd be a little 			disappointed, too.				(off Garak's questioning				look)			It could have been sent by			survivors from the Cardassian			fleet that was lost in the Gamma			Quadrant.					GARAK				(dismissive)			Oh, I've given up hope of ever 			finding any trace of them.					ZIYAL			Really? I never saw you as the 			giving up type.	From Bashir's expression, neither has he. DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's... " - REV. 12/04/96 - TEASER 5A-6.   5    CONTINUED:					GARAK				(to Ziyal)			There comes a time when you have 			to face reality, my dear. Those 			people are gone and they're never 			coming back.				(a beat)			Well, my young friends, I could 			sit here and chat all day, but I 			have dresses to make, pants to 			mend... It's a full life, if a 			trifle... banal.	Garak gets up to take his leave.					GARAK			Tell Captain Sisko I'd be happy to 			decode any Cardassian laundry 			lists that come across his desk.	Ziyal holds out her hand to Garak, who presses his palm 	against hers. It's the Cardassian equivalent of a kiss 	on the cheek.					GARAK			My dear.	He EXITS.6    CLOSE ON BASHIR AND ZIYAL	As they watch him go. Bashir looks thoughtful, as if 	not totally satisfied by his conversation with Garak.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's... " - REV. 12/04/96 - TEASER    7.6    CONTINUED:					ZIYAL			My father would be furious if he 			heard me say this, but there's 			something about Garak that I find 			fascinating.					BASHIR			He has his moments.									CUT TO:7    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR	Garak, carrying a duffel bag and dressed to travel, 	walks briskly toward the airlock, a man on a definite 	mission. Looking both ways to see that the coast is 	clear, he hits the airlock control and ENTERS...8    INT. AIRLOCK	Garak walks quickly to the door of a runabout which is 	docked at the end of the airlock. He takes a device 	out of his coat pocket and places it over the keypad. 	He punches in a code, the device lights up, and there's 	the sound of the runabout door unlocking.	Garak smiles, removes the device and the runabout door 	opens.9    INT. RUNABOUT	Garak comes in and heads for the cockpit, only to find 	Bashir sitting in the pilot's seat, aiming a phaser at 	him.					BASHIR			Going somewhere?	And as Garak reacts to this unexpected development, 	we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                             DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's...

Bashir still has his phaser trained on 	Garak.					GARAK			Doctor, I really must remember to 			stop underestimating you. How did 			you know?					BASHIR			You mean that you were lying about 			the contents of the message?				(smiles)			You said you'd given up on finding 			Cardassian survivors in the Gamma 			Quadrant. But Ziyal's right. 			You're not the giving up sort.	Garak smiles. Bashir has him there.					GARAK			Very good, doctor. You've come a 			long way from the naive young man 			I met five years ago. You've 			become distrustful and suspicious. 			It suits you.					BASHIR			I had a good teacher.				(a beat)			what did the message really say?					GARAK			It was a call for help. From 			Enabran Tain.   DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's... " - REV. 12/04/96 - ACT ONE    9.10   CONTINUED: 	Bashir looks surprised.					BASHIR			Tain? But you told me you saw the 			Dominion blow up his ship.					GARAK			I did. But Enabran Tain was the 			head of the Obsidian order for 			twenty years. If he survived 			that, he can survive anything.				(a beat)			I have to find him, doctor. I owe 			it to him.					BASHIR			You don't owe Tain anything. He 			had you exiled from Cardassia.					GARAK			Yes, but aside from that, we were 			very close. He was... my mentor. 			And I'm not going to turn my back 			on him.				(a beat)			If it'll make you feel better, 			come with me. All you have to do 			is make up some excuse for taking 			the runabout and we could leave 			immediately.	Bashir thinks it over.					BASHIR			Let me get this straight. You're 			asking me to lie to my commanding 			officer, violate Starfleet 			regulations, and go off with you 			on a mission that will probably 			get us both killed?					GARAK				(takes a seat)			I'm ready when you are.					BASHIR			In that case, let's go...				(raises the phaser)			to Captain's Sisko's office.   DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's...

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Sisko's just heard Bashir and Garak's story and is 	thinking it over.					SISKO			How do you know the message isn't 			a fake? That it was really sent 			by Tain?					GARAK			The code sequence was personally 			designed by Tain and myself. No 			one else knows it. Somehow he got 			that message out. Now I have to 			follow it back to its source.					SISKO			Did the message contain any 			coordinates?					GARAK			No. Most of it was identification 			code. The rest was just one			word... "alive," repeated over 			and over again. So it should be 			easy enough to triangulate the source.				(a beat)			Captain, Tain might not be alone. 			There could be others. Troops 			from the Cardassian/Romulan fleet, 			survivors from the Dominion attack 			on New Bajor, even crewmen from 			the Federation ships that've 			disappeared in the Gamma Quadrant.			This is a mission of mercy. You 			can't ignore it.	Sisko thinks this over.					SISKO			I'm still not totally convinced 			the message is genuine.				(comes to decision)			But I suppose there's only one way 			to find out.	Bashir knows what Sisko's thinking and doesn't like it.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "In Purgatory's...

But you're still 			not going alone.	Garak turns to Bashir and smiles.					GARAK			Doctor, I think you've just 			volunteered.					SISKO			Doctor Bashir isn't going 			anywhere.

He barely manages to touch a post to stay in the 	fight when his Jem'Hadar opponent launches into him, 	hitting him with a vicious punch/kick combination. 	Martok is laid out and no matter how hard he tries, he 	can't get back to his feet. The Jem'Hadar starts to go 	for Martok, but Ikat'ika holds up a hand.					IKAT'IKA			Enough. It's over.	The Jem'Hadar combatant nods in acknowledgement and he 	and the other soldiers disperse.

Like much of what we've seen from the 	Dominion, form equals function, and nothing is wasted. 	The walls are riveted steel and the only furniture are 	metal bunks for the prisoners.	There're only four prisoners present; two are Romulans 	and one is a Breen, dressed in his cold-weather gear. 	The fourth lies unconscious on a bunk at the far side 	of the room.	Garak walks over to the far bunk with Worf and Martok 	trailing behind him.
