OPS	O'BRIEN is lying in the pit, flat on his back with a scorch 	mark on his chest.  BASHIR is kneeling over him with medical 	equipment as SISKO looks on.  One of the computer panels in 	the pit has been blown apart and there are still a few wisps 	of smoke coming out of the damaged area.  O'Brien's eyes 	flutter open and he looks up in confusion.					BASHIR			It's all right, Chief... you're going 			to be fine.					O'BRIEN				(unsteady)			What... happened?					SISKO			You were re-routing a phase inducer 			when one of the plasma conduits blew 			out.	O'Brien sits up.					BASHIR			Easy there.  You have a mild case of 			radiation poisoning.  I've given you 			some hyronalin, which should 			counteract the affects.				(looks to Sisko)			But I think he should be restricted 			to light duty for a few days.					SISKO			Agreed.	KIRA comes over to Sisko.					KIRA			Commander, the transport's arrived 			and they're requesting permission to 			dock.             DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - TEASER             2.1    CONTINUED:					SISKO			Route them to Docking Bay Twelve.  			Inform the Romulan delegation that 			we'll meet them there.	Kira nods and moves off.  O'Brien gets to his feet and heads 	climbs up the ladder with Bashir.					SISKO			And Chief...	O'Brien stops.					SISKO				(continuing)			"Light duty" means light.  I don't 			want to see you crawling around the 			Jefferies tubes tonight, chasing 			down power surges.	O'Brien puts a hand to his head.					O'BRIEN			You won't get any arguments today, 			Commander.	Sisko gives him a slight smile as O'Brien and Bashir EXIT.  	He then looks over at Kira, who's finishing her work at the 	console.					SISKO			Ready, Major?	Kira nods.  Sisko heads for the EXIT and Kira follows him.									CUT TO:2    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	The station hangs in space.3    INT. PROMENADE	Sisko and Kira are walking along the Promenade when suddenly 	ODO and TWO SECURITY GUARDS come out of Quark's.  The Guards 	are holding an obviously drunk Klingon named BO'RAK, who is 	struggling as they haul him away.					BO'RAK			Du'cha Kovah!  Estah!  (Leave me 			alone!  Let me go!)	Sisko looks concerned.             DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - TEASER             3.3    CONTINUED:					SISKO				(to Odo)			I wasn't aware there were any Klingons 			on the station, Constable.					ODO			They just arrived a few hours ago.  			It seems the main computer on their 			freighter was damaged and they need 			a complete overhaul before they can 			continue back to the Klingon Empire.					KIRA			How long will this overhaul take?	The Klingon belches loudly.					ODO				(with distaste)			Two days, at least.	Sisko inclines his head at Odo, who steps aside for a private 	meeting.					SISKO				(quietly)			The Romulan delegation has arrived 			and they're going to be here for at 			least two days while they study our 			intelligence reports on the Dominion.  			I want you to keep a close eye on 			the Klingons.  We don't need any 			trouble right now.					ODO			Understood.				(to guards)			Let's go.	Odo and the guards drag off the Klingon.  Sisko and Kira 	head down the corridor...									CUT TO:4    INT. AIRLOCK	As Sisko and Kira arrive.  Two N.D. Security Guards are 	standing outside the airlock.  Kira nods to a guard, who 	hits a control and the airlock doors OPEN.  TWO large, burly 	N.D. Romulan Guards walk out and look around impassively.             DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - TEASER            3A.4    CONTINUED:	After a beat, TWO ROMULAN DIPLOMATS dressed in civilian 	clothes follow them.  One is a man in his forties named RUWON.  	The second is a woman about the same age named KARINA.             DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - TEASER             4.4    CONTINUED:	(2)	Their attitudes are cold and brusque.					SISKO			Welcome to Deep Space Nine.  I'm 			Commander Sisko... this is my first 			officer, Major Kira.					RUWON			I am Ruwon.  This is Karina.  We are 			ready for your report on the Dominion.					SISKO			We have quarters arranged for you.  			I know it's been a long trip... 			perhaps you'd like to --					RUWON			We are not interested in your 			accommodations, commander.  We are 			here for your intelligence briefing.  			Nothing else.	Sisko and Kira exchange a look -- this isn't going to be a 	pleasant meeting, but they try to make the best of it.  Sisko 	leads them down the corridor.					SISKO			Very well.  If you'll come this way.	As they walk off...									CUT TO:5    INT. QUARK'S	where QUARK is hanging O'Brien's dartboard on a bulkhead.  	O'Brien is taking slow, deliberate steps away from the 	bulkhead... pacing off a certain distance.  Finally, he stops 	and turns to Quark.					O'BRIEN			This will be the foul line.  We'll 			need to put some kind of marker here 			on the floor.					QUARK				(grumbling)			I still don't see how this is going 			to help my business, Chief.	Quark steps away from the dartboard, which is crooked.             DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - TEASER             5.5    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(re: board)			No, no, that's not right.  The number 			twenty should be at the top.	Quark sighs and adjusts the dart board.					O'BRIEN			Trust me, Quark.  Darts and bars go 			together like bacon and eggs.					QUARK			At least people order bacon and eggs.  			In all the years I've been here, no 			one has ever come in and asked to 			see the dart board.	Quark joins O'Brien back at the foul line.					O'BRIEN			Trust me.  They will.	Quark reaches over and picks up a handful of darts that are 	sitting on a nearby table.					QUARK			I just don't see the appeal of this 			game.  No lasers... no holograms... 			just steel tips and feathers.					O'BRIEN			It's a game of skill, Quark.  And 			it's not so easy.  Go ahead.  Try to 			get one in the bullseye.	Quark thinks about it for a second, then before O'Brien can 	protest, he throws the entire handful of darts all at once.					O'BRIEN			No -- !	O'Brien and Quark react with shock at something off camera...6    ANGLE ON MORN	sitting at a nearby table.  His uniform is now covered with 	Quark's darts.  He looks a little disturbed and unsure how 	to react to the darts now poking out of his uniform.             DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - TEASER             6.7    RESUME QUARK AND O'BRIEN					QUARK				(outraged, to O'Brien)			Now what if one of those darts had 			gone into his eye?  Do you realize 			I'd be liable for that?  Do you know 			how much money an eye costs?					O'BRIEN			You're not supposed to throw them 			like that, Quark.	He takes another dart off the table.					O'BRIEN			You throw them one at a time... 			gently.  Like this.	He takes careful aim at the board... and as the dart leaves 	his hand, we suddenly...									CUT TO:8    INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	O'Brien is standing on the second level in the exact same 	pose we just left him.  He looks around, confused at this 	sudden change of setting.  Although O'Brien doesn't realize 	it yet, he has just jumped five hours into the future.	Before O'Brien can fully realize what's going on, he hears 	Quark's voice from off camera:					QUARK'S VOICE			Chief O'Brien?	O'Brien turns and reacts in shock to what he sees --9    NEW ANGLE	Across the Promenade, Quark has just stopped another O'Brien.  	Neither this Future O'Brien nor Quark has seen the other 	Past O'Brien standing across the Promenade yet.					QUARK				(to Future O'Brien)			The Klingons have destroyed two of 			my holosuites.  I need a maintenance 			crew immediately.	Future O'Brien looks annoyed... this is a familiar story.             DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - TEASER             7.9    CONTINUED:					FUTURE O'BRIEN			Quark, we go through this every time 			Klingons come aboard the station.  			Why don't you just keep them out of 			the holosuites?					QUARK			Have you ever said no to a Klingon?  			Besides, they're paying me double.	The Future O'Brien rolls his eyes a bit, and in doing so, he 	catches a glimpse of his past self standing across the 	Promenade, o.s.  He reacts in shock...10   ANGLE ON PAST O'BRIEN	who is staring at his future self in bewilderment.  He takes 	a step toward his future self, and as he does so, we...									CUT TO:11   INT. QUARK'S	Where the dart thuds into the wall.  O'Brien has returned to 	the exact same moment he left.  No one around him is aware 	that anything has happened.

INFIRMARY	O'Brien is sitting on a diagnostic table.  Bashir is finishing 	a series of tests.					BASHIR			The pain you experienced appears to 			be a muscle spasm caused by a sudden 			decrease in your serum calcium levels -- 			it's a typical side effect of 			radiation poisoning.	Bashir picks up a hypospray and gives him an injection.					BASHIR				(continuing)			I'm giving you some asinolyathin for 			the pain.					O'BRIEN			But what about... the vision I had?					BASHIR			Mild hallucinations are also a fairly 			common side-effect of this type of 			radiation poisoning.					O'BRIEN			It was anything but mild.  I really 			felt like I was watching myself 			standing on the Promenade, talking 			to Quark.					BASHIR			Hmmm.  What was the conversation 			about?					O'BRIEN			He was... complaining about some 			Klingons... he said they'd damaged 			two of his holosuites.	Bashir looks a little concerned.            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT ONE             9.12   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Well... you do seem to have one 			problem.				(beat)			If all you can hallucinate about is 			Quark's maintenance problems... I'd 			say you have a sadly deficient fantasy 			life.	O'Brien gives him a dirty look, gets up off the table.					O'BRIEN			Thank you for your professional 			opinion.	Bashir smiles.					BASHIR			Any time.  My door is always open to 			you, Chief.	O'Brien heads out the door and Bashir goes back to work.									CUT TO:13   INT. WARDROOM	Sisko and Kira are sitting across the table from Ruwon and 	Karina.  The Romulan Guards are standing outside the room in 	the Corridor.  There are several PADDS on the table.  Ruwon 	puts down one of the PADDS.					RUWON			This is insufficient.					SISKO			That report was compiled from 			intercepted Dominion communications 			in the Gamma Quadrant over the past 			three weeks.  It's the latest 			information we have.					RUWON			It is still insufficient.					KARINA			We want to see the raw data from the 			relay which intercepted these 			communications.					KIRA			I can arrange that.            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT ONE            10.13   CONTINUED:					RUWON				(pushing)			The Dominion represents one of the 			greatest threats to the Alpha Quadrant 			in the last century.  We need more 			information on their military 			capabilities.  How many ships do 			they have?  Where are they deployed?  			What are their plans for the future?  			Are they planning an attack?					SISKO			We don't know any of that yet.					KARINA			You have one of the Founders of the 			Dominion on this very station.  He 			should be able to tell us everything 			we need to know about their 			intentions.					KIRA			Odo is not one of the Founders.					KARINA			Your own reports indicate that a 			group of changelings are the real 			source of power behind the Dominion...					KIRA			Yes...					RUWON			And Odo is a changeling.					KIRA			But he's not a Founder.					RUWON			I fail to see the distinction.					KIRA			Odo made a conscious choice to stay 			here with us.  He has no loyalty to 			the Dominion and he has no information 			about their plans.					RUWON			We find that hard to believe.            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT ONE           10A.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO				(firm)			It's the truth, whether you choose 			to believe it or not.	A tense beat.  Ruwon and Karina exchange a look.  Ruwon gets 	up, clasps his hands behind his back and takes a few steps 	toward the window.  He stares out at the stars for a moment.            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT ONE            11.13   CONTINUED:	(3)					RUWON			Commander... we allowed you to place 			one of our cloaking devices on the 			Defiant in exchange for information 			regarding the Dominion.				(beat)			So now, you have the cloaking device 			and we have... very little.					KARINA			We shouldn't have to remind you of 			the importance both our governments 			place on continuing to carry out 			this agreement.

Stand by weapons 			systems.				(to Dax)			Dax, see if you can pinpoint the 			exact location of the Romulan ship.	Dax and Kira go to work...76   INT. INFIRMARY	As before.  Bashir is finishing a scan of O'Brien.					BASHIR			I don't understand.  Your body should 			be flooded with delta series 			radiation... but there's only a very 			slight amount in your tissues.  Your 			metabolic readings are different... 			what happened?					FUTURE O'BRIEN			There's been a... change.	Future O'Brien frowns to himself for a moment, mulling over 	exactly what has taken place...									CUT TO:77   INT. WARDROOM	Ruwon and Karina are interrogating Quark, who is not happy 	to be sitting in the hot seat.					QUARK			I really don't have anything else to 			say.            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT FIVE          55A.77   CONTINUED:					RUWON			I think you're lying, Quark.					QUARK			About what part?         DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - REV. 01/06/95 - ACT FIVE         56.77   CONTINUED:	(2)					RUWON			All of it.					QUARK				(trying to make a 				little joke)			Well, at least I'm consistent!	The Romulans apparently have no sense of humor.  Quark withers 	slightly under their relentless stares.  Sisko, Kira, Odo, 	and Two N.D. Security Guards ENTER.					SISKO			Quark, you can leave.	Quark jumps at the chance.					QUARK			Thank you!	He EXITS.  Sisko turns to the two Romulans.					SISKO			I know you have a cloaked warbird 			orbiting the station.  And I know 			you're planning an attack.	The Romulans play it cool and betray no reaction.					SISKO				(continuing)			At first, I couldn't understand why.  			Then I remembered what you said about 			the Dominion... how they were the 			"greatest threat to the Alpha Quadrant 			in the last century."  If you really 			believed that, then the only way you 			could ever be truly safe from the 			Dominion would be to collapse the 			Wormhole.					KIRA			But you knew we wouldn't just sit by 			and watch while you did it... so you 			had to destroy the station, as well.  			That way, there would be no witnesses.					ODO			Everyone would assume that Deep Space 			Nine was destroyed by what appeared 			to be "the accidental collapse of 			the Wormhole."            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT FIVE          56A.77   CONTINUED:	(3)	Ruwon and Karina study Sisko for a long moment.					KARINA			An interesting... theory, Commander.  			But that's all it is... a theory.            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT FIVE           57.77   CONTINUED:	(4)					SISKO			That's right.  But I'll tell you 			what's not a theory.  We've tracked 			the tetrion emissions back to your 			warbird... and I have about fifty 			photon torpedoes locked on to it 			right now.	Ruwon and Karina exchange a look.					RUWON			I think it's time we left.					SISKO			I couldn't agree more.				(to Odo)			Constable, please escort our... guests 			to the nearest transporter room.	Odo nods and gestures to the door.					ODO			If you'll come with me...	A beat, then Ruwon and Karina EXIT...									CUT TO:78   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	as before.79   INT. QUARK'S	Bashir and O'Brien are playing darts.					BASHIR			So you're saying you remember playing 			this same game with me in the future?	Bashir throws a dart.					O'BRIEN			Right.	Bashir thinks about this.					BASHIR			So tell me what I'm going to hit.            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT FIVE          57A.79   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Outer ring.  Twenty.	Bashir throws the dart --            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT FIVE           58.80   ANGLE ON DART BOARD	as the dart hits the outer ring -- twenty.81   RESUME O'BRIEN AND BASHIR	Bashir reacts.					BASHIR			That's remarkable.					O'BRIEN			It's also a little disturbing.  I 			have this nagging feeling that I 			don't really belong here... that 			this isn't really my life.				(beat)			Maybe this life belongs to that other 			Miles O'Brien...					BASHIR			Chief... whether you're in the past 			or in the present, you are Miles 			O'Brien.  The only difference is, 			you have a few memories the other 			one didn't have.	O'Brien takes a beat.					O'BRIEN			Well, I think I'm going to go to 			bed.  I'm still kind of tired.					BASHIR			That sounds like a good idea.	As Bashir and O'Brien head for the door, O'Brien pauses by 	Quark, who is leaning on the bar.					O'BRIEN			Quark...				(beat)			Dabo.	Quark gives him a puzzled look.  Suddenly from off camera we 	hear a woman's voice:					WOMAN'S VOICE			Dabo!            DEEP SPACE: "Visionary" - 01/03/95 - ACT FIVE           59.	The crowd cheers as the gambler rakes in his winnings.  	Quark reacts in shock.  But when he turns back O'Brien and 	Bashir have already left.					QUARK			Chief, wait!  Chief...	OFF Quark's stricken look...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
