She's been sitting here a long time and 	her initial emotional reaction has subsided, leaving 	her weary and searching for understanding.					WINN 			I'll do anything you ask... you 			need only give the word.	Silence.					WINN 			Have you nothing to say to me? 			Am I so offensive to your eyes 			that I no longer exist to you?	Silence.					WINN 			There must be something I can do 			to prove that I'm still worthy of 			your love.	Silence.									CUT TO:30   INT.

KAI WINN'S QUARTERS - LIVING ROOM	Solbor ushers Kira -- now in uniform -- into the 	room. Solbor removed his outer vestments some time 	earlier in the night, and his tired expression tells 	us Winn's been keeping him working all hours lately.					SOLBOR 			Colonel Kira to see you, 			eminence.	Winn is sitting on the couch in her vestments and 	cap. She's pulled herself together somewhat, but 	the strain and fatigue are still there just below 	the surface. She gestures that Kira sit --					WINN 			Come in, child. Thank you for 			seeing me at such a late hour.	Solbor bows and EXITS --					KIRA			What can I do for you?	Winn considers how best to proceed.					WINN 			I've often sensed that you don't 			approve of how I've conducted 			myself as Kai -- that you believe 			I've put my own political 			interests ahead of our people's 			spiritual well-being.	Kira has no way of knowing where Winn is going with 	this. Her silence confirms Winn's statement.					WINN 				(pained) 			I wish I could say I disagreed 			with that assessment...	Kira is utterly nonplussed by Winn's admission.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

That it would change you --					WINN 			I want to change -- I'd do 			anything to earn their 			forgiveness.				(anguished) 			But I'm afraid it's too late --					KIRA 			It's never too late. Even the 			worst of us can be redeemed.					WINN 			How?					KIRA 			I'm not a Vedek, but it seems to 			me that you have to set aside the 			things that led you astray --			ambition, jealousy...					WINN				(desperate to				believe)			Yes, I've given in to the			temptations of power.					KIRA 			Then turn away from temptation --      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

She stares at Kira for a 	beat.					WINN 			Step down?	Kira nods, she thought that was understood.					WINN 			I don't understand. Why would I 			do that? Bajor needs me.					KIRA				(I thought we 				agreed) 			Eminence, being in power is what 			led you down the wrong path.					WINN 			But I'm resolved to change.	Winn stands and moves to the window.					WINN				(rationalizing) 			Don't you see? Once I've 			regained the Prophets' trust, 			I'll be better able to serve them 			if I remain Kai.	Kira sits back as the realization dawns that Winn 	isn't willing to do what it takes -- she's still the 	same political animal she's always been.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange... " - REV. 03/19/99 - ACT FOUR     38A.31A  CONTINUED:	(3)					WINN 			If the Prophets wanted me to step 			down, surely they would have told 			me so.	Kira stands and turns to her. When she speaks it's 	without judgment -- she's holding out hope that the 	Kai might still come around.					KIRA 			They don't always use words to 			make their wishes known. 			Sometimes they speak to us by 			touching our hearts. And only 			you would know if they've done 			that.	Winn knows full well that Kira's asking her to be 	honest with herself. She does her best to 	rationalize staying in office, but it comes out wan 	and unconvincing.					WINN			Bajor needs me...					KIRA			Good night, eminence.	And with that, Kira turns and EXITS. Off Winn as 	she wrestles with the thought of giving up her 	office and making things right with the Prophets...									CUT TO:      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

Weyoun lets the 	laughter die in his throat at the sight of Damar, 	shooting Thot Gor a sidelong glance. Damar gets the	feeling that they were just laughing about him.					WEYOUN 			Damar. There you are. I want 			you to hear this. Thot Gor had 			an interesting observation 			regarding our forces along the 			Romulan border. In his view, we 			have failed to take advantage of 			several weaknesses in their 			defenses.					DAMAR 			Is that so.					WEYOUN 			For instance, their colony in the 			Unroth System is ripe for attack. 			Their long-range sensor array is 			being repaired and...	Damar suddenly sees something on his monitor that 	deeply shocks him.					DAMAR 			Septimus Three has fallen!					WEYOUN 			Excuse me?					DAMAR 			Septimus Three -- an entire 			Cardassian Order has been wiped 			out! Five hundred thousand men!					WEYOUN 			Oh, yes. A great tragedy.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

I said 			the situation would be dealt with 			and it was.					DAMAR 			By leaving them to be slaughtered 			by the Klingons?					WEYOUN 			If you will calm down and listen, 			I'll explain. 				(beat) 			The sacrifice made by the 			Eleventh Order was not in vain. 			They forced the Klingons to 			commit valuable troops and 			resources to capture a 			strategically worthless planet.	Thot Gor issues a burst of STATIC.					WEYOUN 			I'm glad you agree.					DAMAR 			Well, I don't! You condemned a 			half million loyal Cardassians --					WEYOUN			If they were truly loyal, then 			they died willingly for the 			Dominion. There can be no 			greater sacrifice.					DAMAR 			And how many more of these			sacrifices will my people be 			asked to make?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

Vorta, Cardassian, 			Jem'Hadar, now Breen -- we all 			serve the Founders and we'll all 			make whatever sacrifices they 			deem necessary.	Weyoun holds Damar's seething gaze for a moment, 	then turns back to Thot Gor.					WEYOUN				(pleasantly) 			Thot Gor, would you mind 			reiterating your plans for the 			Unroth System? I seem to have 			lost my train of thought.	Damar stalks out of the room. Thot Gor issues 	STATIC once he's gone.					WEYOUN				(to Thot Gor) 			Yes, I know. It's become 			increasingly difficult to get a 			full day's work out of him.									CUT TO:33   INT. DAMAR'S QUARTERS	Damar ENTERS, still enraged over what just happened, 	and goes directly to the bottle of kanar on the 	table. He uncorks it, pours himself a glass, throws 	back the drink, then quickly pours himself another.	But before he can down this second glass, he catches 	sight of himself in the mirror on the wall and 	stops. Damar stands there for a long beat, looking 	at himself holding the glass and the bottle... and 	doesn't like what he sees.	He puts down the glass... and corks the bottle.									CUT TO:      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

Ezri is leaning against	the wall.					EZRI 			The Dax symbiont has lived for 			over three hundred years. 			Experienced eight lifetimes. 			And now it's all going to end... with 			an execution on Cardassia. Ezri 			Tigan's contribution to the Dax 			legacy... will be to end it.					WORF 			There is no honor in self-pity.					EZRI 			You know Worf, I've had just 			about enough of your little 			Klingon aphorisms. The only reason 			I came on this mission was 			to save your miserable life, so 			the least you can do is stop 			acting like a self-righteous 			targ.					WORF 			Your motives for finding me were 			not honorable.					EZRI 			Do you really think I disobeyed 			orders, and risked my life so I 			could seduce you? I hate to 			burst your bubble Worf, but it 			wasn't that good.					WORF 			Always the barb, always the joke.					EZRI 			There was a time when you thought 			my sense of humor was one of my 			more endearing qualities.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

Not you!					EZRI 			Are you angry at me because of 			something I've done or because 			I'm not Jadzia?	Worf fumes, but refuses to answer. Ezri tries 	another tack.					EZRI 			Let's cut right to the heart of 			the matter. Do you really love 			me -- me? Ezri?					WORF 			You are trying to turn this 			around and make it about me...					EZRI 			Answer the question. Do you love 			me?					WORF 			I made my feelings clear back on 			Goralis Three.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

That 			you don't have the same feelings 			for me that you had for Jadzia? 			If that's true, maybe we both			made a mistake back on Goralis. 			So maybe we both should be 			forgiven.	Fury flashes in Worf's eyes, but he pulls back.					WORF 			This night would be better spent 			preparing ourselves for the next 			life, rather than rehashing the 			mistakes of this one.	He turns away from her and bows his head in prayer. 	Ezri watches him in silence and realizes that she 	may never resolve anything before they're executed.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Strange...

I... do 			not love you as I loved Jadzia.	Ezri is now fully awake and she moves to look at 	him.					EZRI 			There's no crime in that.					WORF 			I... dishonored myself. 				(beat) 			I know how often I use that 			word... perhaps too often. But 			in this case, it is... 			appropriate. From the moment I 			first saw you on the station, I 			knew that you were not Jadzia. 			And yet I also knew that a part 			of her was still alive within 			you. On Goralis, I allowed 			myself to see her... instead of 			you.					EZRI 			I felt the same way. A part of 			me -- the part that was your wife			-- wanted very much to be close 			to you.					WORF 			I realize that Jadzia saw... 			physical love very differently 			than I do. To her it could have 			many meanings... but to me it is 			a... deeply spiritual act. 				(beat) 			When I made love to you, my 			motives were not... spiritual. 			It was... an unworthy impulse.					EZRI 			Worf, we're not gods or prophets. 			We're people.

The two Guards slump to the floor dead, 	revealing Damar standing there with a phaser in his 	hand. Worf and Ezri are dumbfounded.
