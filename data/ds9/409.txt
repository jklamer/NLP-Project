SPACE - RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)	The Runabout Rio Grande cruises through empty space.2    INT. RUNABOUT	KIRA is at the controls.  BASHIR is working on a PADD... 	preparing a medical report... after a beat, Kira pushes 	herself into saying with admiration...					KIRA			I've never seen anything like that.					BASHIR				(working)			Hmm?					KIRA				(repeating)			I've never seen anything like that.					BASHIR			The woman?					KIRA			She was dead... the tricorder clearly 			showed...					BASHIR			Ah yes, well tricorders... very 			accurate with live people, not so 			accurate with dead ones... we learn 			that in the first year of medical 			school...	Trying very hard to give him a compliment...					KIRA			Well, I was impressed, Doctor.					BASHIR				(working)			Hmmm.  And well you should be.           DEEP SPACE: "The Passenger" - 12/09/92 - TEASER           2.2    CONTINUED:	That leaves her mouth open... and now he gets quite expansive 	about himself... given the opportunity...					BASHIR			I impressed myself on this one 			actually.  I can't imagine what other 			Doctor would even consider examining 			the scapular nodes for parasitic 			infection.  I just seem to have a 			talent.  A vision that sees past the 			obvious, around the mundane... right 			to the target.  Fate has granted me 			a special gift, Major.  A gift to be 			a healer.	And now her mouth is dragging on the floor...					KIRA				(what an ass)			I feel privileged to be in your 			presence.					BASHIR				(the sport)			Glad to have you along.	Luckily for him, a warning light flashes on the console.					COMPUTER VOICE			Detecting a priority one broad band 			distress signal.	Kira and Bashir are instantly all business.  She presses 	some panels... the audio message comes through a little 	distorted, but intelligible.  The voice on the message is 	female and belongs to TY KAJADA, whom we will meet soon.					KAJADA (O.S)			Kobliad transport Reyab to any 			ship.  Our central power linkage 			has exploded.  We're losing life 			support.  Please respond...	Bashir consults a console.					BASHIR			Just picking it up on long range 			sensors.

KOBLIAD TRANSPORT - CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	A smoke-filled hallway... a Kobliad woman (KAJADA) dressed 	in a military type uniform is unconscious on the floor... 	she's burned slightly... Bashir and Kira BEAM IN.  They 	immediately feel the effect of falling life support... hard 	to breathe... They take tricorder readings.					BASHIR			O-2 pressure dropping rapidly... 			toxic gas levels rising... we have 			no more than ten minutes breathing 			time left in here...					KIRA			Automatic fire suppression must be 			off-line.  I'll check the central 			power linkage...	She moves through the corridor and EXITS... Bashir moves to 	Kajada... examines her with his tricorder... she moves with 	a start at his touch...					BASHIR			Relax.  I'm a doctor...	He shoots Kajada with a hypospray from his medkit.  Kajada 	slowly comes around.					KAJADA				(groggy)			What happened?					BASHIR			You lost consciousness.				(a beat)			We've got to evacuate your ship.  			How many others are on board?           DEEP SPACE: "The Passenger" - 12/09/92 - TEASER          3A.4    CONTINUED:					KAJADA				(struggling to maintain 				consciousness)			The pilot... is dead...	Bashir is already looking at his tricorder which leads him 	to a door near Kajada...					BASHIR			I'm reading another lifeform...					KAJADA			No... don't open that...           DEEP SPACE: "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - TEASER           4.4    CONTINUED:	Bashir ignores her warning, presses the panel... it doesn't 	open the door...					BASHIR			It's sealed...					KAJADA			Prisoner... I'm transporting... he 			started the fire... to escape...					BASHIR			He's dying.  Where's the manual 			override...					KAJADA			No...	Bashir scans the hallway... moves down the hallway to a 	panel... opens it and hits a padd... the door slides open... 	flames shoot out into the corridor... Bashir braves them to 	go inside... Kajada driven by her own determination gets to 	her feet and follows...					KAJADA			Don't...5    INT. KOBLIAD TRANSPORT - HOLDING CELL	A small room, full of fire and smoke.  A Kobliad male (RAO 	VANTIKA) is collapsed on the floor.  He is badly burned, 	barely alive.  Bashir opens his medkit and goes to work.					KAJADA			He's... dangerous.					BASHIR			I assure you, in this condition, 			he's no threat to anyone.	Kira runs in from the corridor with a 24th century fire 	extinguisher...           DEEP SPACE: "The Passenger" - 12/09/92 - TEASER           5.5    CONTINUED:					KIRA			Power linkages are completely shot... 			maneuvering subsystems are out... 			I've managed to stabilize the 			structural integrity field, but I 			don't know how long that will last... 			we'll have to tow it in...	As she shoots nitrogen on the fire, Bashir injects Vantika 	with the hypospray, but the criminal remains comatose.					BASHIR			His synaptic fields are dissipating... 			I can't get a neural reading... I 			have to get him to the emergency 			unit in the Runabout.					KIRA				(nods, hits combadge)			Computer, four to transport...	Suddenly, Vantika reaches out with one hand and grabs Bashir 	by the throat.  He pulls Bashir down until the two men are 	eye to eye.  Bashir struggles, trying to pull back from 	Vantika's badly burned face.					VANTIKA				(harsh, gravelly voice)			...make... me... live...	Bashir wrestles to free himself from Vantika's vice-like 	grip.  Kira rushes to the doctor's rescue, but, before they 	can do anything, Vantika releases Bashir and slumps to the 	ground.  Bashir scans Vantika with his tricorder.  Touches 	his neck.  Almost immediately, Kajada slumps and Kira supports 	her...					BASHIR				(shakes his head)			This one I can't bring back.	As they exchange a glance...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - ACT ONE           6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)6    EXT.

STASIS ROOM - A BODY CABINET (OPTICAL)	Vantika has been laid out on the shelf... Bashir hits a 	button... the shelf slides out of the wall and a stasis 	forcefield ZAPS off.					BASHIR			The preliminary examination indicated 			that the subject died of a massive 			respiratory failure, brought on by 			the pulmonary trauma suffered in the 			fire.					KAJADA			Are you sure it's the same body?					BASHIR				(a little surprised 				at the question)			Quite certain.

The last 			time someone thought he was dead, 			they didn't live to regret the 			mistake.	She looks around the workstation and casually picks up a 	long, narrow-tipped tool.					BASHIR			He was a murderer... ?					KAJADA			That description doesn't do justice 			to the horrors he is responsible for 			on my world.				(beat, studying him)			He is quite brilliant in his way.  A 			man of science.  Who killed others 			to prolong his own life.  I've tracked 			him for twenty years.	A beat.  Then, Kajada takes the tool and plunges it down in 	Vantika's chest.  Bashir reacts with shock.					KAJADA				(calmly)			Please perform an autopsy.

Day or night.	Dax smiles slightly and walks away with her coffee.  Quark 	watches her go with a lascivious eye.					QUARK				(an aside)			Poor woman.  She's obviously 			infatuated with me.	ODO snorts in derision from his usual seat at the end of the 	bar.  A few yards away, within earshot is LIEUTENANT PRIMMIN, 	a Starfleet security officer in his mid-thirties.  He has a 	friendly face, an easygoing smile and a passing resemblance 	to a teddy bear.					ODO			You're deluding yourself.					QUARK			There's nothing wrong with a good 			delusion.  I sell them upstairs to 			dozens of people every day.				(beat)			Besides, there's something in her 			eyes when she looks at me.          DEEP SPACE: "The Passenger" - 11/25/92 - ACT ONE          10.11   CONTINUED:					ODO			An allergic reaction, no doubt.					QUARK			I think she's lonely.					ODO			Dax?  She has ten lifetimes of friends 			to call on before she calls you.  			And every man on the station would 			like to be buying her a Raktajino.					QUARK			Ah, but I'm the one with the Raktajino 			machine.					ODO			She seems to prefer to spend most of 			her time alone... which I understand 			perfectly.					QUARK			Well, then that must make her the 			perfect woman for you.					ODO			I wouldn't intrude on her privacy as 			some would.					QUARK			You're pathetic.  You think everyone 			in the galaxy should be as lonely 			and miserable as you are.	Quark looks longingly at Dax, who has taken a seat at one of 	the tables and is reading from a PADD and sipping her coffee.					QUARK			As hard as it may be for you to 			understand, some of us like company.  			The sound of a friendly voice.

OPS	SISKO, Kira, Dax and Bashir are conferring.					BASHIR			The autopsy revealed nothing out of 			the ordinary.  Fingerprints, cerebral 			cortex scan, and retinal patterns 			all match up perfectly with the 			records Kajada provided.  Vantika 			may have faked his death before, but 			I don't think he's faking this time.					SISKO			Why was he coming here?					BASHIR				(self-evident)			They're Kobliad.					DAX				(understands 				immediately)			The deuridium.					KIRA			I'm sorry... ?					SISKO			The Kobliad is a dying race.  They 			need deuridium to stabilize their 			cell structure.  It prolongs their 			lifespan...					DAX			The Federation's been working to 			supply them with deuridium, but even 			the new deposits from the Gamma 			Quadrant won't be enough to service 			the whole population.  It's so scarce, 			some of the Kobliad have gone 			underground to get it.					KIRA			So he was coming here to hijack the 			shipment.					SISKO			Is Kajada satisfied with your autopsy?					BASHIR			I don't think anything's going to 			convince her he's dead, Commander.         DEEP SPACE: "The Passenger" REV. 12/01/92 - ACT ONE        14.16   CONTINUED:					DAX			Vantika has been the focus of Kajada's 			attention for most of her adult life.  			In a way, they were as intimately 			connected as any two people could 			be.					SISKO				(a thoughtful beat)			Let's do her the courtesy of granting 			her requests as long as they're not 			too far out of line.  A quick sweep 			of her ship isn't too much to ask.	Dax nods and Sisko rises signaling the meeting is ending...					SISKO			I'm more concerned that he might 			have had help waiting here to hijack 			the shipment.	Over the last line, Primmin is arriving on the Turbolift... 	as Sisko sees him...					SISKO			Mister Primmin, good.  In my office.  			I need to brief you on an unusual 			security issue that's been raised...					KIRA				(protecting her own)			I'll get Odo up here...					PRIMMIN				(reacts)			Ah... that's okay, Major.  I'll fill 			him in later on anything he needs to 			know.	He moves toward Sisko's office.
