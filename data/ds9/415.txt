A tall, craggy-	faced and raw-boned farmer (also of Bajoran origin), his 	considerable age has not bowed him in the slightest.  He's 	an impressive figure.					KIRA			Neither do I, but it comes with the 			job.					MULLIBOK			Which is?					KIRA			Do we talk, or do they attack?	Mullibok nods slightly to Baltrim and Keena.  They lower 	their weapons.  But there's no invitation to Kira.					MULLIBOK			You're halfway pretty.					KIRA			Does that mean I can come in?					MULLIBOK			Problem is, I don't like uniforms, 			either.

COTTAGE - DAY	BASHIR labors over Mullibok -- who's just regaining 	consciousness -- but is obviously in poor shape.  Kira stands 	in b.g., still visibly affected, as:					BASHIR				(to Mullibok)			Just rest easy.  You took a phaser 			blast which punctured your peritoneum.  			It's serious, and if you try moving 			around, you're going to make it worse.					MULLIBOK			Another uniform.					BASHIR			Doctor Julian Bashir, Starfleet.  			Major Kira sent for me.					MULLIBOK			She did, uh?...				(louder; at Kira)			... You're backwards, Nerys... I told 			you...	Kira, unsure of what to say and uncomfortable as hell, heads 	for the door; will EXIT, as:					MULLIBOK				(back to Bashir)			With me unconscious, she could've 			just had us swept off of here with 			no trouble at all.				(suddenly recalls)			My friends... Baltrim and Keena...					BASHIR			They've been evacuated to Bajor.  			I'll be taking you back to our 			station, so I can...					MULLIBOK			No.  I stay here.56   EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE - DAY	Kira stands, lost in brooding thought, just outside the 	cottage door -- as it's opened from within.  Bashir emerges.					BASHIR			He refuses to leave.             DEEP SPACE: "Progress" - 2/16/93 - ACT FOUR            39.56   CONTINUED:					KIRA				(small smile)			Really.					BASHIR			He's got to be cared for.  I'm going 			to take him without his permission.					KIRA			No you're not.					BASHIR			He needs close attention.  There's 			no medical facility here.					KIRA			I'll be here.	Kira now moves away -- toward the kiln in b.g.  As she goes, 	she's stripping off her tunic, with:					KIRA				(without turning back)			Leave me instructions and whatever 			medication you think he'll need.57   KIRA AT KILN	In her shirt now, and focused only on the task at hand, she 	begins preparing to lay bricks on the prospective kiln wall.58   ON BASHIR	From his just standing there -- without a clue -- watching 	her, we go to:59   INT. SISKO'S OFFICE - ON BASHIR	as he reports:					BASHIR			She didn't offer a word of 			explanation, Sir.  She simply removed 			her uniform tunic and started... 			building.             DEEP SPACE: "Progress" - 2/16/93 - ACT FOUR            40.60   INCLUDING SISKO	at his desk; not thrilled.					SISKO			Well Doctor, right now she stands a 			pretty good chance of being out of 			uniform permanently.				(thoughtful beat)			I'm going to tell Minister Toran 			that she's remained temporarily on 			Jeraddo at your request.					BASHIR			But sir, that... isn't true.					SISKO				(not just a request)			Make it true, Doctor.  Now, please.					BASHIR				(beat)			Commander, I'd advise that Major 			Kira remain on Jeraddo for 			humanitarian reasons, uh...				(aside)			... How long?					SISKO			The next day or two.					BASHIR			For the next day or two, sir.					SISKO			Thank you, Doctor; I'll consider 			that request.  Dismissed.	At first, Bashir thinks there's something else to say -- but 	there isn't.  So, after a beat, he just turns; heads out.  	HOLD on a thoughtful Sisko for a beat.  He finally rises; 	moves out of his office.61   EXT. SPACE - ON MOON JERADDO (OPTICAL)	Re-Establishing.62   INT.

I was starting to 			think you'd sleep all day.					KIRA			That's because I was up all night 			taking care of you.					MULLIBOK			I don't recall asking you to.	And they go back to work on the kiln -- together.					MULLIBOK			Look, I can handle this.

As it catches -- and he regards it with satisfaction -- 	Kira RE-EMERGES, carrying two large satchels filled with his 	belongings.  She sets them down a few yards from the cottage.  	He moves away from the kiln, toward Kira, with:					MULLIBOK			What's all this?					KIRA			You finished your work; I have to 			finish mine.					MULLIBOK			But you don't want to.          DEEP SPACE: "Progress" - REV. 2/19/93 - ACT FIVE          53.					KIRA			No...

But before he can do so, 	she whips out her phaser, and FIRES at the kiln, which 	explodes into a fiery mass.					MULLIBOK			What the hell are you doing!					KIRA			Saving your life.	She strides to the kiln; lights a wooden brick-framing tool -- 	then moves to the cottage.81   FOLLOWING KIRA	She lights the roof eave, first on the left side of the place, 	and then on the right.  She then tosses the burning wood 	through an open window.81A  ANOTHER ANGLE	As the cottage begins burning intensely, she comes back to 	Mullibok.					MULLIBOK			So you chose your uniform over me 			after all.					KIRA			That's not true.
