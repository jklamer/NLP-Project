DEEP SPACE NINE - ORE PROCESSING UNIT	The room is two-level factory-like setting.  The second level 	has several ore chutes coming out from the wall and the first 	level is dominated by a large ore reactor and a narrow conduit 	leading from the reactor into the floor.  O'BRIEN is using a 	hand-held tech device to adjustments to an open panel in the 	reactor.  JAKE is at a small computer console off to the 	side of the room.					O'BRIEN			How's it going, Jake?					JAKE			Fine.  I've deleted about half the 			Cardassian files from the computer.  			I can't believe how many subroutines 			it took just to run this ore 			processor.					O'BRIEN			Well, it used to be a pretty large 			operation.  When the Cardassians 			were in charge, I understand they 			were processing twenty thousand tons 			a day.				(looks around)			It must've been hell in here... I've 			heard stories that the temperature 			used to reach fifty-five degrees 			Celsius.	Jake reacts with surprise.					JAKE			How could the Bajoran workers survive 			that?					O'BRIEN			A lot of them didn't.        DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - REV. 09/16/94 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED:	Jake takes that in... keeps working at the console.  	O'Brien moves away from the reactor and picks up a tricorder.					O'BRIEN			As soon as you've deleted all those 			files, I'll show you how to download 			the new operating system.					JAKE			You really think we can convert this 			place into a deuterium refinery?					O'BRIEN			Absolutely.  It'll take us three, 			maybe four weeks at the most.	SISKO ENTERS as O'Brien says this.					SISKO			I hope you're planning on eating 			sometime during those four weeks.					O'BRIEN				(a little abashed)			Commander... I guess I lost track of 			the time.        DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - REV. 09/16/94 - TEASER         3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					JAKE			We're almost finished, Dad.				(beat)			Chief, I'm having a problem deleting 			one of these files.	O'Brien moves to look at the computer screen.					O'BRIEN			Did you try reformatting the data 			cluster?					JAKE			Yeah, but the file's still here...	O'Brien takes over the console.					O'BRIEN			Let me see...				(beat)			Well, that's odd.  The file has no 			name... no indication of what it 			is... I better set this aside for 			now.  I can transfer it to the central 			database in Ops and analyze it in 			the morning.	He works for a moment... then reacts with surprise to 	something on the screen.					O'BRIEN			Wait a minute...					COMPUTER VOICE			Unauthorized computer entry detected 			in Ore Processing Unit Five.  Enter 			access code.	O'Brien looks a little puzzled but enters his code anyway.					COMPUTER VOICE			Incorrect code.  You have five seconds 			to enter correct access code.					JAKE				(alarmed)			Or what?           DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - 09/12/94 - TEASER           4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					O'BRIEN			I don't know.  But I'm going to shut 			this thing down.	O'Brien works, but then the computer console goes DARK.  	Suddenly the doors to the room slam SHUT.  They react in 	surprise.					COMPUTER VOICE			Warning...2    INT. OPS	KIRA, DAX and BASHIR are in Ops, along with a handful of 	N.D. Crewmembers.  The monitors in Ops are all displaying a 	CARDASSIAN SYMBOL.  Everyone is listening to the computer 	voice with surprise.					COMPUTER VOICE				(continuing)			... worker revolt in progress in Ore 			Processing Unit Five... Security 			countermeasures initiated.					KIRA			What the hell... ?3    INT. ORE PROCESSING UNIT	Sisko and O'Brien are trying to open the doors, but they 	won't move.					RECORDED GUL DUKAT (O.S.)			Bajoran workers... your attention 			please.	Sisko, Jake, and O'Brien react in surprise to the sound of 	Dukat's voice.  They turn and see...4    MONITOR (VPB)	Which now displays a recorded image of GUL DUKAT, sitting in 	the Commander's Office on the station.					RECORDED GUL DUKAT				(on monitor)			Your attempt to seize control of 			this facility is going to fail.

Consider your options 			carefully... your lives depend on 			it.				(beat)			You have eight minutes to make your 			decision.	The image of Dukat disappears and is replaced with the 	Cardassian symbol.  Off the reactions of Sisko, O'Brien and 	Jake...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - 09/12/94 - ACT ONE           6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5    INT. ORE PROCESSING UNIT	O'Brien has opened the control panel near the door and is 	trying to open the door as Sisko and Jake look on.  O'Brien 	shakes his head in frustration.					O'BRIEN			The computer's engaged the magnetic 			seal.  I can't override it.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Ops to Sisko.					SISKO			Go ahead.	INTERCUT AS NEEDED:6    INT. OPS	Kira, Dax, and Bashir are studying the consoles... all the 	monitors still display the Cardassian symbol.					KIRA			Commander, what's going on down there?  			We just got a recorded message from 			Gul Dukat regarding some worker revolt 			in the ore processing facility.					SISKO			We saw the same message.  It seems 			we've tripped some kind of automated 			security program left by the 			Cardassians.  We're locked in.					KIRA			We'll beam you out of there.	Kira looks to Dax, who crosses over to O'Brien's station.  	Dax tries to work the console, but...					COMPUTER VOICE			Enter access code.					DAX			What?        DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - REV. 09/15/94 - ACT ONE        7.6    CONTINUED:	Dax looks up at Kira in frustration.					BASHIR			If this security program thinks 			there's been some kind of worker 			revolt... then it must also think 			the station is still under Cardassian 			rule... so it's probably waiting for 			us to enter some kind of emergency 			code.					KIRA				(frustrated)			One that the Cardassians never 			bothered to tell us when they left.	They look at each other in frustration.6A   INT. ORE PROCESSING UNIT					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Commander, we're not going to be 			able to transport you out of there 			just yet.	He glances to Jake and O'Brien with frustration...					SISKO			Understood.6B   INT.

I'm busy.					QUARK			Well... is there anything I can do 			to help?					ODO			Not unless you have a level nine 			Cardassian security clearance.					QUARK			Let's see... I think I have everything 			from levels one through seven.	Odo looks surprised.					ODO			I only have levels one through six.					QUARK			Well if you'd like level seven, I'm 			sure we could come to some kind of 			an arrangement.					ODO			Leave me alone, Quark.					QUARK			Oh, no.  Something very wrong's going 			on... and this is the safest place 			on the whole station.  So I'll just 			stay right here.					ODO				(irritated)			Whatever you want, Quark... but do 			it quietly.	Quark shuts up.									CUT TO:          DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - 09/12/94 - ACT ONE           9.8    INT. ORE PROCESSING UNIT	Sisko has climbed up the ladder and is trying to open the 	maintenance hatch on one of the ore chutes.  O'Brien is at 	the computer console.					O'BRIEN				(to Sisko)			Any luck?					SISKO			Nothing.  It's probably magnetically 			sealed like the door.  We'd need a 			phaser to blast it open.	Sisko climbs down the ladder.					O'BRIEN				(re: console)			There's just no way I can disable 			the program from here.	The monitor comes alive again with the recorded image of 	Dukat.					RECORDED GUL DUKAT			Bajoran workers.  Your time is running 			out.  But it's not too late... you 			can still surrender and save your 			lives.	The Dukat image is replaced by the symbol.  Sisko and O'Brien 	exchange a look -- there's an idea.					SISKO				(to com)			Computer.  This is... the leader of 			the Bajoran workers.  We surrender.	Gul Dukat now reappears on the screen with a smile.					RECORDED GUL DUKAT			I'm glad to see that you've come to 			your senses.  Stay where you are.  			When Cardassian security arrives, 			they will place you into custody -- 			but you will not be harmed.  You 			have my word.					O'BRIEN			For whatever that's worth.	The image of Dukat disappears again.        DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - REV. 09/16/94 - ACT ONE       10.8    CONTINUED:					JAKE			Now what?					SISKO			It sounds like the program is going 			to wait for "Cardassian Security" to 			enter the all-clear protocol.  That'll 			give us a few minutes, anyway...	They look around the room for some other exit.  Sisko goes 	to the large conduit leading from the floor to the reactor.					SISKO			What's in here?					O'BRIEN			Nothing at the moment.  Processed 			uridium used to flow down that pipe 			to a secondary refining facility on 			level thirty-three where it was 			purified.	Jake reaches for a hatch on the side of the pipe... it just 	swings OPEN.					JAKE			It's not locked.        DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - REV. 09/16/94 - ACT ONE       11.8    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			That's because that pipe would've 			been filled with molten uridium... 			there was no need for any security 			measures.					O'BRIEN			It's too narrow for anyone to try 			and escape through.					JAKE			I can get in there.					SISKO				(to O'Brien)			If he crawls up this pipe into the 			machine... is there some way he can 			get to the ore chute and open...				(pointing to overhead 				hatch)			... that hatch from the inside?	O'Brien considers this for a moment.  The image of Gul Dukat 	reappears on the monitor.        DEEP SPACE: "Civil Defense" - REV. 09/16/94 - ACT ONE       12.8    CONTINUED:	(3)					RECORDED GUL DUKAT			Bajoran workers.  You have not 			surrendered to Cardassian security.  			If you do not do so in the next four 			minutes, I will be forced to release 			neurocine gas into the ore processing 			facility.	The image disappears.					JAKE			I can do it.	Sisko nods.  Jake starts to crawl inside the pipe.  With 	great effort, Jake squeezes into the pipe and disappears 	from sight.					SISKO				(taps combadge)			Jake... can you hear me?					JAKE'S COM VOICE			Loud and clear.  But I can't see a 			thing...	O'Brien taps his combadge.					O'BRIEN			There should be a large circular 			opening to your right.					JAKE'S COM VOICE			Okay... let me see if I can find 			it...	We hear a loud BANG inside the wall.					JAKE'S COM VOICE			Ow!					SISKO			Are you all right?					JAKE'S COM VOICE			Yeah...
