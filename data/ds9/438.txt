OPS (OPTICAL)	KIRA and DAX are at their stations, both zeroed in on their 	instruments.  SISKO is looking up at the viewscreen, which 	displays a close view of a small Cardassian ship, moving 	erratically, shimmering with plasma discharge, obviously in 	trouble.					KIRA			Definitely Cardassian.					DAX				(checking panel)			And in trouble.  Its engines are 			completely disabled.					SISKO			Open a hailing frequency.				(to screen)			This is Commander Sisko of Deep Space 			Nine.  Do you need assistance?	Nothing but STATIC from the screen.					DAX			They're not answering.				(checking monitor)			Their life-support systems are 			operating on reserve power.					SISKO			Better lock on a tractor beam and 			pull them into Docking Bay Seven.  			Notify Chief O'Brien to meet me there.	Sisko EXITS.          DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/13/94 - TEASER          2.3    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	The stations tractor beams pull in the damaged Cardassian 	ship.4    INT. CARGO BAY SEVEN	Sisko and O'BRIEN wait as the airlock door rolls back.  	Two young Cardassians step out.  They're dressed in civilian 	clothes and look nervous and a little scared.  The male, 	HOGUE, is wide-eyed and innocent.  The female, REKELEN, is 	edgy and hyperactive.	After they survey the scene, a statuesque, striking (for a 	Cardassian) female steps out.  This is NATIMA LANG.  She is 	older and much more composed than her two compatriots.  She 	measures Sisko and O'Brien with a long look.					SISKO			I'm Benjamin Sisko, commander of 			Deep Space Nine.				(indicating O'Brien)			My chief of operations, Miles O'Brien.				(concerned)			Do any of you need medical assistance?					NATIMA			I think we're all in good shape, 			considering.  I'm Professor Natima 			Lang.				(indicates the other 				Cardassians)			These are two of my students, Rekelen 			and Hogue.					O'BRIEN			What happened to your ship?					NATIMA			We were caught in a meteor swarm.  			I'm a decent teacher, but I'm afraid 			I'm not much of a shuttle pilot.				(to O'Brien)			Do you think you'll be able to repair 			our ship?					O'BRIEN			I'll have to take a look.  Excuse 			me.	He enters the airlock and disappears.       DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - REV. 01/24/94 - TEASER        3.4    CONTINUED:					NATIMA			We'd like to be on our way as soon 			as possible.  We know having 			Cardassians on a Bajoran station may 			cause trouble.  That's the last thing 			we want.					SISKO			If anyone can fix your ship, it's 			Mister O'Brien.  In the meantime, 			you're welcome to stay here.  If you 			stick to the Promenade, I'm sure 			there won't be any trouble.5    INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL	GARAK and BASHIR sit at a table, in mid-conversation.					BASHIR			Are you saying you agree with General 			Yiri's decision to execute his 			brother?	Garak rolls his eyes.  He senses an argument coming.					GARAK			Of course I agree.  Yiri's brother 			was a traitor to the Trelonian 			government.          DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/24/94 - TEASER          4.5    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			But the evidence is all 			circumstantial.					GARAK			My dear Doctor... it all comes down 			to a question of loyalty.  Yiri had 			to choose between protecting his 			brother or protecting the state.  He 			chose the state... as would I, every 			time.					BASHIR			I suppose that's one way of looking 			at it.  Then again, "Before you can 			be loyal to another, you must be 			loyal to yourself."					GARAK			And who can we thank for those 			misguided words of wisdom?  Sarek of 			Vulcan?					BASHIR			Actually, it was Julian Bashir of 			Earth.  And it's not too bad 			considering I just made it up on the 			spot.					GARAK				(smiles)			With sentiments like those, you 			wouldn't last five seconds on 			Cardassia.	Bashir pounces.  This is the opening he's been waiting for.					BASHIR			Would you?       DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - REV. 01/24/94 - TEASER        5.5    CONTINUED:	(2)	Garak is a little taken aback.  Bashir's question cuts 	right to the heart of the cat-and-mouse game that the two of 	them have been playing for months.					GARAK			Fishing again, Doctor?					BASHIR			Well, assuming you're not a spy...					GARAK			Assuming.					BASHIR			Then maybe you're an outcast?					GARAK			Or maybe I'm an outcast spy?					BASHIR			How could you be both?					GARAK			I never said I was either.	Bashir grins and shakes his head.  He gives up.5    INT. QUARK'S (MAIN FLOOR)	Following ODO as he ENTERS the bar.  He scans the room and 	sees QUARK making drinks.					ODO				(approaching Quark)			I heard an interesting rumor.          DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/13/94 - TEASER          6.6    CONTINUED:					QUARK			Only one?  I started at least twelve.	Odo slides onto a stool, glaring at Quark with that accusing 	look he's mastered so well.					ODO			Rumor has it you've managed to get 			your hands on a small cloaking device.					QUARK			And you believe everything you hear?	Quark busies himself making drinks.					ODO			When it's about you, yes.				(beat)			According to Bajoran law, such a 			device would be highly illegal.					QUARK			If I had one.  Which I don't.					ODO			I didn't expect you to admit it.  			I'm simply serving notice:  You try 			to sell it and I'll see to it that 			you spend the next fifty years digging 			trenches in a penal colony.	Quark turns away from Odo to get something off his backbar 	(under the window to the Promenade).					QUARK				(winces at the 				prospect, but:)			I told you... you have nothing to 			worry about, because...	Quark's voice trails off as he sees Natima and her students 	on the Promenade.  His face goes slack.					QUARK			Excuse me.	Quark leaves the Bar.          DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/13/94 - TEASER          7.7    INT. PROMENADE	Quark steps out onto the Promenade and stares at the 	Cardassians.  He's visibly shaken, but finally finds his 	voice.					QUARK			Natima?	It's barely a whisper, but Natima turns and spots Quark.  	She stops in her tracks.  They stand there for a long moment, 	eyes locked and loaded with history.					NATIMA			Quark.	Natima steps up to Quark, still not quite believing her eyes.					QUARK			I knew you'd come b...	But before Quark can finish his sentence, Natima hauls back 	and slaps Quark.  Hard.					NATIMA			I told you never to speak to me again.	Natima storms off as Quark shakes off the blow.8    NEW ANGLE	As Odo approaches Quark.					ODO			Are you all right?	Quark holds his jaw as he watches Natima stalk away.					QUARK			All right?				(really means it)			This is the happiest day of my life.	Quark's eyes are still locked on Natima.  HOLD on Odo as he 	ponders Quark's connection to the Cardassian woman, then:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/13/94 - ACT ONE          8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)9    INT.

At least let me buy 			you and your friends a drink.  I 			could make you a Samarian Sunset.					NATIMA			I don't drink Samarian Sunsets 			anymore.					QUARK			Why not?					NATIMA			Because they remind me of you.					HOGUE				(to Natima)			Is this...				(says it like an insult)			Ferengi bothering you?					QUARK			This Ferengi happens to be Natima's 			old and cherished friend.

I'd love to sit in on one 			of your classes.  What do you teach?					HOGUE			Political Ethics.					REKELEN				(with fervor)			Her teachings will change the future 			of Cardassia.					NATIMA			That's enough, Rekelen.					QUARK			Not at all.  I want to hear more.	Taking Rekelen and Hogue by the arms, he leads them back 	toward his bar.					QUARK			I always knew that Natima was destined 			for greatness.					NATIMA				(exasperated)			Quark...					QUARK			Just one drink.  It'll be like old 			times.					NATIMA			It'll never be like old times.					QUARK			You're right.				(to himself)			It'll be better.	Quark leads Rekelen and Hogue into the bar and Natima has no 	choice but to follow.         DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/13/94 - ACT ONE         10.10   INT. QUARK'S	Quark ushers Natima and her students to a table.  They sit.					QUARK			I'll be right back with 			refreshments.	Quark leaves Natima alone with her students.11   FOLLOW QUARK	As he moves back to the door and starts to mix a drink.  Odo 	gives him a bemused look.					ODO			Your hands are shaking.	Indeed they are.  Quark steels himself, does his best to 	ignore Odo as he continues mixing.  But Odo isn't so easily 	dissuaded.					ODO			So how well does this woman know 			you?  Just enough to dislike you, or 			well enough to really hate you.					QUARK			She used to work here at the station.  			She was a correspondent for the 			Cardassian information service.  It 			was before your time.					ODO				(not giving up)			So which is it... dislike or hate?					QUARK			It's none of your business, but if 			you have to know... I was the love 			of her life.	And with that he sets a single drink on the tray and moves 	off, leaving Odo to contemplate someone actually loving Quark.					ODO				(harumphing)			Must have been some life.         DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/13/94 - ACT ONE         11.12   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As Quark returns with the drink.  He sets it down gingerly 	in front of Natima.					HOGUE			What about our drinks?					QUARK				(dismissive)			If you want a drink, the bar's right 			over there.	Hogue and Rekelen look angry, but Natima nods, dismissing 	them.  They head for the bar, leaving Quark and Natima alone.					QUARK				(indicating the drink)			Your Samarian Sunset.	Quark reaches over and gently PINGS the glass with his finger.  	The clear liquid suddenly erupts with a bright orange color.					NATIMA				(there's no force 				behind her anger)			I said I didn't drink these anymore.					QUARK			Because they remind you of me.  But 			since I'm here anyway, you may as 			well enjoy yourself.  Besides, it's 			on the house.	She picks up the drink and holds it up to the light.					QUARK				(continuing)			You know, you're as beautiful as 			ever.	Natima sets the drink back down.					NATIMA			And you're as big a liar as ever.					QUARK				(exuberant)			You see... just like old times.				(a beat)			I've missed you, Natima.  And that's 			no lie.         DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/13/94 - ACT ONE         12.12   CONTINUED:					NATIMA				(looking around the 				bar)			You seem to have kept busy.					QUARK			Oh, yes.

Garak betrays no 	emotion beyond a cold assessment of the situation.         DEEP SPACE: "Profit and Loss" - 01/13/94 - ACT ONE         13.13   CONTINUED:	Garak nods politely and EXITS.14   ANGLE ON NATIMA	Noticeably apprehensive.  Hogue and Rekelen also spot Garak 	and immediately rejoin Natima.					NATIMA			I didn't think there'd be any 			Cardassians left on the station.					QUARK			He's the only one.					HOGUE				(concerned)			What do we do now?					QUARK				(confused)			Why?

Why would 			Cardassians fire on other Cardassians?					DAX				(looking beyond Kira)			Maybe you should ask her.	Kira and Sisko turn to see Natima, Hogue and Rekelen step 	out of the Turbolift.
