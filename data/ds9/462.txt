Quark quivers 	and sighs.  He's in heaven.					EMI			Tell me again.					QUARK			Tell you about what?					EMI			About the stem bolts.					QUARK			I have one hundred gross of self-			sealing stem bolts sitting in Cargo 			Bay Eleven.					EMI			And they're all mine?					QUARK			For only ten bars of gold-pressed 			latinum.	She starts rubbing his ears quicker.					EMI			You don't know how much this means 			to me.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - TEASER           2.1    CONTINUED:					QUARK				(close to ecstasy)			You don't know how much this means 			to me.					EMI			With those stem bolts, my family 			will be able to triple production of 			our reverse-ratcheting routing 			planers.					QUARK			Glad to be of help.	Emi continues oo-moxing as she leans over and breathlessly 	whispers into Quark's ear.					EMI				(seductive)			Quark, I can't wait any longer.  Why 			don't you and I... go down to Cargo 			Bay Nine and... sign the contract?	Quark is tempted, but he wants to prolong his pleasure.					QUARK			No need to rush.  Your family's ship 			won't be here for a week.  We'll 			have plenty of time to finalize the 			deal before then.					EMI			That's an unusual attitude for a 			Ferengi.					QUARK			I'm a very unusual Ferengi.	Quark settles back for more oo-mox, but the door CHIMES.					QUARK				(continuing, re: the 				door)			Ah... that must be the Saurian brandy 			I ordered.				(to the door)			Enter.	But instead of the expected Ferengi waiter, ROM ENTERS, 	looking a little panicky.					QUARK			Rom?

She's 			willing, she's wealthy... and she's 			wants to buy our stem bolts.					ROM			It's going to have to wait.  Something 			important has come up.					QUARK			Right now, nothing is more important 			than this.	But just then...2    NEW ANGLE	A small, hooded figure ENTERS the room, supporting himself 	on a familiar-looking cane.  It's the GRAND NAGUS ZEK, though 	we never see his face.  He's followed almost immediately by 	his towering Hupyrian servant MAIHAR'DU.					QUARK				(shocked, to Rom)			Grand Nagus Zek.					ROM			As big as life.	Maihar'du takes one look at Emi and points sternly at the 	door.  Emi looks at Quark for guidance.					QUARK				(panicky, waving her 				away with his hands)			Go.  Go!          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - TEASER           4.2    CONTINUED:	Emi flees.  Without a word, the Nagus walks into Quark's 	bedroom and Maihar'du follows, glaring at Quark as he walks 	by, as if daring him to protest.					QUARK				(whispers)			What does Zek want with me?					ROM			Looks like he's moving in with you, 			brother.	And as Quark reacts to this news, we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT ONE          5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)3    INT.

Everyone cheers.					BASHIR			What's this?	Dax approaches with two glasses of champagne and hands one 	to Bashir.					DAX				(playful)			Champagne.	She leads Julian over to the others.       DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - REV. 12/12/94 - ACT ONE        6.5    CONTINUED:					SISKO			Congratulations, Doctor.					BASHIR			Thank you.				(smiles)			Now will someone please tell me what's 			going on here?					SISKO			The Federation Medical Council has 			announced the nominees for this year's 			Carrington Award.

As far 			as I know, my name wasn't even up 			for consideration.					DAX			Oh, it was up for consideration.  I 			submitted it myself... through an 			old friend of Curzon's.					KIRA			You deserve the nomination, Doctor.  			Your work on biomolecular replication 			was "both audacious and  			groundbreaking."				(smiles)			According to Dax anyway.  She's the 			only one who understands it.					O'BRIEN			So how does it feel to be the youngest 			nominee in the history of the 			Carrington award?          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT ONE          7.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR				(embarrassed)			It feels... good.	He drains his glass in a single gulp.					BASHIR			Now if you'll excuse me, I should 			get back to work.	And with that, he turns and EXITS.

Bashir and Dax are walking and 	talking on the second level of the Promenade.					BASHIR			Jadzia, what exactly is it that you 			want me to say?					DAX			I want you to say that you're thrilled 			beyond belief to be nominated for 			the Federation's most prestigious 			medical award.					BASHIR			Believe me, I'm honored to be 			nominated.					DAX			You're not acting like it.					BASHIR			I just don't want everyone making a 			big deal out of it.					DAX			But it is a big deal.  We're all 			proud of you.					BASHIR			I'm glad, but before you suffer 			through the next few days waiting 			for the board's decision, let me 			assure you that I'm not going to 			win.       DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - REV. 12/12/94 - ACT ONE        8.7    CONTINUED:					DAX			You don't know that.  The work you've 			been doing deserves to be recognized.					BASHIR			This isn't about my work.  Do you 			know what the life expectancy of a 			Carrington Award winner is?				(before she can answer)			Five years.  Ten at the very best.  			And do you know why?				(answering his own 				question)			Because the Carrington Award is 			intended to be the crowning 			achievement for a lifetime in 			medicine.  April Wade is a hundred 			and six.  The last time she was 			nominated, three years ago, people 			said it was premature.					DAX			Julian, you're exaggerating.					BASHIR			Maybe a little.  But the undeniable 			truth is I am far too young to be a 			serious candidate for the Carrington.  			Now, put my name up for nomination 			in seventy years, and I promise you, 			I will get extremely excited.  But 			until then, I don't plan on giving 			it much thought.					DAX			That's a very mature attitude.					BASHIR			You sound surprised.					DAX			Actually, I'm astounded.  But 			impressed.					BASHIR			So then we don't have to dwell on 			this for the next three days.					DAX			I won't mention it again.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT ONE          9.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR			I appreciate that, Jadzia.					DAX				(after a beat)			So who do you think is going to win?  			Wade or P'Trell?	And as Bashir sighs...8    INT. ROM'S QUARTERS	A tired Quark steps out of the bedroom, having just gotten 	dressed.  He looks around at the disaster area that passes 	for Rom's Quarters.  There are clothes and unwashed dishes 	everywhere.  Quark goes to the replicator.					QUARK				(to replicator)			A cup of millipede juice, hold the 			shells.	We hear the sound of the replicator working (off screen) and 	Quark reaches in and pulls out a steaming hot cup of bright 	yellow liquid.	He takes a sip.  It's good, but not enough to elevate his 	mood.  He sits down on a clothes-strewn couch, grimaces, 	reaches around and pulls an empty bottle out from under his 	butt.					QUARK				(annoyed)			Rom.	Rom sticks his head out of his bedroom.  He's using a Ferengi 	tool vaguely reminiscent of an electric toothbrush to clean 	his ears.					ROM			Did you call me, brother?					QUARK			Would it be too much trouble for you 			to put these empty bottles in the 			replicator?					ROM			Keeping my quarters clean is Nog's 			job.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT ONE         10.8    CONTINUED:					QUARK			Except Nog is on the Homeworld 			visiting his grandmother.					ROM				(looks around)			Then cleaning will just have to wait 			until he gets back.					QUARK			No it won't.

It's just a big empty room.	Maihar'du is sitting on the floor in a corner, reading a 	large handwritten book.  He looks puzzled and a little upset.					QUARK			What happened to my furniture?					ZEK			I got rid of it.

He is not happy.					ZEK			You're about to read the shining 			triumph of my life.  The one thing 			I'll always be remembered for.	Zek hands Quark the book.  Quark and Rom exchange a look.					QUARK				(re: the book)			May I?       DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - REV. 12/12/94 - ACT ONE       15.					ZEK			By all means.	Quark tentatively opens the book.

Quark is pacing 	back and forth, trying to make sense of the Nagus's Rules.					ROM			Rule Number Twenty-One, "Never place 			profit before friendship."				(turning pages)			Rule Number Twenty-Four "Latinum 			tarnishes, but family is forever."				(turning pages)			Rule Twenty-Eight, "Money can never 			replace dignity."					QUARK				(losing patience)			Skip to the end.	Rom flips ahead until he gets to the last page, then reads 	it silently.					QUARK			Well, what is it?					ROM			You're not going to like it, Brother.					QUARK			I can take it.  Tell me.					ROM			Rule number Two Hundred and Eighty-			Five, "A good deed is its own 			reward."	Suddenly Quark reals as if about to pass out.  Rom leaps to 	his feet and goes to support Quark.					ROM			Brother, are you all right?					QUARK				(wobbly)			I... just need to sit down.	Rom helps his brother take a seat against the wall.  Quark 	still doesn't look so good.  Rom starts fanning him with the 	book of Rules.  It's like waving garlic in front of a vampire.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         18.13   CONTINUED:					QUARK			No... Take it away.	Rom realizes what he's doing isn't helping.					ROM			Sorry.	He puts the book aside.					QUARK				(to himself)			Got to think.  Got to think.  There 			has to be an explanation... a reason 			for why he's doing this.					ROM			Maybe we should ask him.	Rom stands up and starts to head toward the bedroom.  But 	Quark grabs his arm and pulls him back down.					QUARK			No.  Don't you see?  He's testing 			us.				(grasping at straws)			Yes.  That must be it.  It's some 			kind of test.				(urgent)			Get the book.					ROM				(doesn't understand)			You want to hear more?					QUARK			No.  It must be some kind of code.  			Read me the first word of every Rule.					ROM				(complying)			If... never... keep... profit... 			a... good... smile... honesty.					QUARK				(likeit means something)			If never keep profit a good smile 			honesty.					ROM			What does it mean, Brother?          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         19.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK				(with conviction)			It means... absolutely nothing.				(still grasping)			Maybe if we hold the pages up to the 			light.	Quark takes the book from Rom and holds it at different angles 	up to the light.					QUARK			No... that's not it.	He examines the binding, the ink, the fabric of the paper.  	He smells it, taps on it and listens to it, and licks it, 	but still can't find an answer.					QUARK			The answer must be right in front of 			us.					ROM			I know.  Maybe the Nagus has gone 			insane.					QUARK			Nonsense.  The Nagus is the most 			brilliant Ferengi alive.  I've 			modeled my life after him.  Don't 			ever let me hear you speak that way 			about him again.					ROM			But what if he really believes all 			this?					QUARK			How could he believe this insanity?  			No.  It has to be part of some 			brilliant, twisted, devious plan.  			The Nagus isn't like you and me, 			Rom.  He thinks ten, sometimes twenty, 			steps ahead.  These Rules are probably 			the key component in some vast plot 			to seize financial control of the 			entire quadrant.					ROM			So what do we do?					QUARK			The only thing we can do.  We put 			down this book and we walk away.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         20.13   CONTINUED:	(3)	Quark sets the book on the floor.					QUARK			When the Nagus feels ready, he'll 			inform us of his plans.  But until 			then, we have to act as if we know 			nothing.					ROM				(happy)			I can do that.					QUARK			Don't worry,  Rom.  In time, all 			will be revealed.	And as Rom looks at his brother with admiration...									CUT TO:14   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Re-establishing.15   INT.

Quark is behind the bar, working absentmindedly and 	muttering to himself.					QUARK				(still trying to make 				sense of it)			"If never keep profit a good smile 			honesty."				(shakes his head)			Nah.	He tries to concentrate on his work.  Just then, the Nagus 	ENTERS, followed by a morose Maihar'du.					ZEK			Quark, my boy.  What do you say we 			buy everyone a drink?  Put it on my 			tab.	Rom overhears this and moves closer.					QUARK			But... why?          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         21.15   CONTINUED:					ZEK			Because it will make everyone happy.  			And that will make me happy.					ROM				(aside to Quark)			It must all be part of his plan.  			Wheels within wheels, Brother.	Quark nods, but he's not convinced.					QUARK				(to the waiters)			Drinks for everyone.  Compliments of 			the Grand Nagus.				(to Zek)			Is there anything else I can do for 			you, Nagus?				(tempting)			We just got in a shipment of quality 			Hupyrian beetle snuff.					ZEK			Actually, I've lost my taste for 			beetle snuff.  It might be fun for 			you and me, but it's no fun for the 			beetles.				(a beat)			By the way, Quark, I just met the 			most lovely young female.  She stopped 			by your quarters, looking for you.					QUARK			Was her name Emi, by any chance?					ZEK			Now that you mention it, I believe 			it was.  She wanted me to tell you 			that her family's ship has arrived 			with the latinum.					QUARK				(excited)			It's about time.				(to Rom)			Rom, watch the bar.  We're finally 			going to get rid of those stem bolts.					ZEK			I don't think so.	Quark looks at Zek in surprise.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         22.15   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			But we have a contract.					ZEK			Which was never signed.  And frankly 			Quark, you were charging an outrageous 			price for those stem bolts.					QUARK			She didn't seem to think so.					ZEK			She did once I explained it to her.					QUARK			You what?					ZEK			I couldn't let you take advantage of 			an innocent young woman like that, 			Quark.  So I told her where she could 			get all the stem bolts she needed... 			at wholesale.					QUARK				(crushed)			Wholesale?				(to Rom)			He told her where to get them at 			wholesale.	Quark wanders off in a daze.					QUARK			What am I going to do with a hundred 			gross of stem bolts?	Rom and the Nagus watch him go.					ROM			My poor brother.					ZEK			Don't worry about him.  Eventually, 			he'll sell those stem bolts... at a 			fair price.					ROM				(bewildered)			A fair price?  I'm very confused.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         23.15   CONTINUED:	(3)					ZEK			That's understandable.  It will take 			some time to get used to the new 			ways.					ROM			New ways?					ZEK				(friendly)			Walk with me, Rom.	They walk off, leaving Maihar'du alone at the bar.  He reaches 	out and takes a bottle, then pours himself a big drink.16   INT. CARGO BAY	Close on a dart board, maybe with a few BLINKIES around the 	edges, but basically a recognizable regulation English-style 	dart board.  Three darts land in succession.  They're good 	throws, but not anything spectacular.17   NEW ANGLE	As O'Brien goes and pulls out the darts.  The techy dartboard 	keeps score automatically.					O'BRIEN			Your turn.	Bashir waits at an impromptu throwing line which has been 	painted on the floor.  He's got three darts in his hand, but 	he looks dubious.					BASHIR			I don't know about this.					O'BRIEN			Would you rather play racquetball?					BASHIR			Chief, since Keiko's been on Bajor 			we've played one hundred and six 			games of racquetball.					O'BRIEN			Right.  So throw a dart.	Bashir tosses a dart.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         24.17   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			I'm a little rusty.					O'BRIEN			So am I.	Bashir throws another dart.					O'BRIEN			I suppose the smart money's on Wade 			or P'Trell.	Bashir throws his third dart and misses the board entirely.  	The dart CLANGS off the metal bulkhead.					BASHIR				(retrieves his darts)			That seems to be the general 			consensus.					O'BRIEN			I mean, Doctor Wade is very popular.  			But P'Trell is doing some amazing 			work in gerontological research.				(a beat)			Which one do you think will win?					BASHIR			Either of them would be a worthy 			recipient of the Carrington.					O'BRIEN				(makes his tosses)			Of course, if I had my druthers, the 			award would go to you.					BASHIR			Thank you.					O'BRIEN			But let's face it.  You don't stand 			a chance.	Even though this is absolutely true, O'Brien's still getting 	some small enjoyment out of needling Bashir.					BASHIR				(agreeing, as he takes 				his turn)			You don't say.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         25.17   CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN			I mean, I know how talented you are, 			but I bet there're doctors all over 			the Federation saying, "Julian Bashir, 			who the hell is he?"	O'Brien smiles as Bashir clangs another dart off the bulkhead.					BASHIR			Chief, you are absolutely right.	Bashir retrieves his darts and O'Brien gets ready to throw.					O'BRIEN			I'm glad you agree.					BASHIR				(mischievous)			So... how much longer is Keiko going 			to be on Bajor?	O'Brien's throw goes awry.

MORN is waiting expectantly outside Quark's, 	which is still closed.	A sleepy Quark approaches, and as Morn looks at him with 	reproachful eyes, Quark realizes that the bar's still not 	open.					QUARK			Hey, Rom...	Quark bangs on the door.					QUARK			Open up.	There's no response.  Morn shrugs.					KIRA (O.S.)			Something wrong, Quark?	Quark turns and sees Kira approaching.       DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - REV. 12/16/94 - ACT TWO       26.19   CONTINUED:					QUARK			My brother should've had this place 			open an hour ago.					KIRA			Last time I saw him was last night... 			walking with the Nagus on the 			Promenade.					QUARK			Come to think of it, I don't remember 			him coming back to his quarters last 			night.				(worried)			I'd better go find him.	Quark starts to leave, but Kira grabs his shoulder and stops 	him.					KIRA			Not so fast.				(a beat)			Do you have anything to do with this?	Kira hands Quark a PADD.  Quark looks at it, puzzled.					QUARK			The Ferengi Benevolent Association?					KIRA			This message has been going out over 			subspace all morning.					QUARK			This looks like some kind of offer 			of charitable assistance to those in 			need.					KIRA			The operative words being "looks 			like."  I don't know what you and 			the Nagus are up to, Quark, but I'm 			not going to let you exploit people 			in need.					QUARK			You think this is some kind of scam?					KIRA			Yes.          DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT TWO         27.19   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			I hope you're right.	Quark rushes off.  Kira gives him a questioning look.  Then 	she hears a THUNK and turns to find Morn, leaning his head 	against the door to the bar, utterly defeated.20   INT. QUARK'S QUARTERS	Quark storms into his quarters, which have been transformed 	into an office with multiple subspace communications hook-	ups being manned by Quark's staff of Ferengi waiters.  Rom 	is right in the middle of everything, coordinating their 	activity.  Zek is nowhere in sight, but Maihar'du is sitting 	at a desk, dispiritedly working alongside the waiters.					ROM				(to a waiter)			Make sure the relief shipment is 			sent by high warp courier.  And don't 			worry about the cost.	Quark looks at the changes to his quarters in wide-eyed 	horror.					QUARK			Rom, what's all this?					ROM				(with pride)			You're looking at the sector 			headquarters of the Ferengi Benevolent 			Association.	And as Quark reacts to Rom's announcement...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT TWO                                   DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT THREE        28.                           ACT THREE                            	FADE IN:21   INT.

In the bar.  			And it's time you got started.  And 			make sure the rest of my employees 			go with you.					ROM			That's impossible.  You saw how busy 			they are.  I'm afraid you might have 			to hire some new waiters.					QUARK			Look, whatever the Nagus is paying, 			I'll match it.					ROM			He's not paying us anything.  We're 			donating our time to help launch the 			Benevolent Association.				(proudly)			I'm the association's senior 			administrator.  You know brother, I 			never realized how many people there 			are who could use a little help.					QUARK			If you don't get down to the bar 			right now, you're going to be the 			one who needs help.					ROM			The Nagus said you'd react like this.					QUARK			The Nagus is a very smart man.					ROM			He's more than that.  He's a 			visionary.  He has plans, brother.  			And I'm going to be part of them.         DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT THREE        29.21   CONTINUED:					QUARK			What could the Nagus possibly want 			with you?					ROM				(with pride)			He says I'm "malleable."  And that 			he's going to mold me into a new 			kind of Ferengi.  An evolved Ferengi.					QUARK				(dubious)			Evolved into what?					ROM			I'm not sure, exactly.  The Nagus 			says that the answers lie in his new 			Rules of Acquisition.  He told me, 			"Rom, it's time for the Ferengi to 			move beyond greed."					QUARK			Beyond greed?  There's nothing beyond 			greed.  It's the purest, most noble 			of emotions.					ROM			"Greed is Dead."  That's the tenth 			Rule of Acquisition.					QUARK			No it's not.  The tenth Rule of 			Acquisition is "Greed is Eternal."					ROM			Not anymore.				(a beat)			The Nagus is going to shake the very 			foundation of Ferengi society, and 			we're going to be at his side every 			step of the way.					QUARK			What do you mean, "we?"					ROM			The Nagus has made you the co-chairman 			of the Benevolent Association.

As soon as we get the 			Benevolent Association established 			here, the Nagus plans on returning 			to the homeworld.  And we'll go with 			him.  Think of it.  You and I will 			be there when Zek personally announces 			the "New Rules of Acquisition" on 			the Grand Steps of the Sacred 			Marketplace.					QUARK			We'll be there all right.  And we'll 			probably be right alongside him when 			they throw him off the spire of the 			Temple of Commerce.					ROM			The Temple of Commerce?  But that's 			the tallest building in the Ferengi 			Alliance.  A fall from that height 			could... could...	Rom trails off, finally seeing what Quark is getting at.					QUARK			Exactly.				(a beat)			Don't you see, Rom.  Something's 			terribly wrong with the Nagus.  And 			we have to help him... before he 			gets us all killed.	Quark looks determined.  He knows what he must do and nothing 	will stop him.22   INT. INFIRMARY	Quark and Maihar'du watch with concern while Bashir finishes 	an examination of Zek.  He's performing his last test, which 	involves scanning the inside of the Nagus's ear.					ZEK				(laughs)			That tickles.         DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT THREE        31.22   CONTINUED:	Bashir completes his scan.					BASHIR			Well, I must say, for a Ferengi of 			your age, you're in excellent health.  			That is, aside from some vascular 			damage to your mucus membranes.  You 			really should stop using beetle snuff.					ZEK			As a matter of fact, I already have.					BASHIR			Glad to hear it.	Bashir begins to put away his instruments.					QUARK			Does this mean you're going to have 			to go in for some exploratory surgery?					BASHIR			Why would I do that?					QUARK			To find out what's wrong with him.					BASHIR			There's nothing wrong with him, Quark.					QUARK			That's not true.  There's something 			deeply wrong with him, and you have 			to find out what it is.					BASHIR			I performed every test I can think 			of.  There's no sign of trauma, brain 			damage, mental illness.  His central 			nervous system's operating within 			normal parameters, and his endocrine 			system's in terrific shape.         DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT THREE        32.22   CONTINUED:	(2)					ZEK				(to Quark and Maihar'du)			You see, I told you.				(to Bashir)			They're like a couple of nervous 			investors... always looking for 			trouble.				(a beat)			Oh, well.

Everyone in the Wardroom catches 	this and looks at Bashir.					MEDICAL BIG SHOT				(very surprised)			And the winner is Doctor Henri Roget.	The staff immediately deflates.					SISKO			Roget?					O'BRIEN			How could they give it to Roget?	Everyone gathers around Bashir to offer their condolences, 	but he seems unfazed.					KIRA			Better luck next time.					BASHIR			Maybe in forty or fifty years.	Dax comes up and puts her hand on his shoulder.					DAX				(whispers)			You seem to be handling this very 			well.         DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT FIVE         58.80   CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(aside to her, still 				smiling to the others)			Believe me, I'm not.					DAX			I didn't think so.	Dax gives Bashir a sympathetic pat on the back.81   INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR	Quark and Rom escort Maihar'du and the Grand Nagus Zek back 	to his ship.  The Nagus is back to his sour, nasty ways.  He 	lets off a big juicy sneeze and stuffs some more snuff up 	his nose.					ZEK			Remember what I said, Quark.  If 			anyone asks, you have no idea what 			happened to the charity money.					QUARK			You can count on me.	They reach the steps to the airlock.					ZEK			And you're sure every copy of the 			revised Rules of Acquisition has 			been destroyed?					ROM			The only place the new Rules exist 			is inside my head.	Zek stops dead in his tracks and looks at Rom appraisingly.  	Even Rom realizes that was not the right thing to say.  	Maihar'du takes a step toward Rom.					QUARK				(saving Rom's butt)			Don't worry.  Within a week, he'll 			have forgotten them all.	Zek glares at Rom.					ZEK			He'd better.	Zek EXITS into the airlock without so much as a good-bye.  	Maihar'du follows him, pausing only long enough to give Quark 	a gentle pat on the head to show his gratitude.         DEEP SPACE: "Prophet Motive" - 12/07/94 - ACT FIVE         59.81   CONTINUED:					ROM			I don't believe it, Brother.  After 			all you did for the Nagus, he never 			even thanked you.					QUARK				(with admiration)			He doesn't have to thank me.  He's 			the Nagus.	They turn and walk off down the corridor.					QUARK			There's only one thing that bothers 			me.  Don't get me wrong, I was honored 			to help the Nagus, but it would've 			been nice if I'd been able to make a 			little profit for my troubles.	Rom grins from ear to ear.					ROM			That's all right.  I made enough 			profit for the both of us.					QUARK			What are you talking about?					ROM			I'm talking about the Ferengi 			Benevolent Association.  Did you 			know it was funded with Zek's personal 			fortune?				(smiles)			I was the senior administrator, 			brother.					QUARK				(outraged)			You embezzled money from the Nagus.					ROM			Surprise.	Quark shakes his head.					QUARK				(with pride)			Father would be proud.	Rom smiles.  Nothing more needs to be said.  Quark throws an 	arm around Rom and the two of them walk off together, one 	big happy family.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
