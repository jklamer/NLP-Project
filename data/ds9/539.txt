FARIUS PRIME - DAY (MATTE SHOT/OPTICAL)	A gritty, industrial city set against a polluted grey 	sky. Modern skyscrapers abut older, brick structures	Despite the contrast in building materials, certain 	architectural elements peculiar to Farius remain 	consistent -- the shape of the windows, perhaps. The 	exception to this is a shantytown that can be seen at 	the edge of the city.2    INT. A TAVERN - DAY (VPB)	Housed in one of the city's older, rundown buildings. 	It's dark and dingy, with a bartop running along one 	wall, a few tables and chairs, and a public COM-UNIT on 	another wall, complete with a MONITOR. Alien graffiti 	is scrawled near the unit, presumably from patrons 	jotting down "phone numbers."	The bartender, a taciturn BOLIAN called Graife, is 	serving a sad-looking YRIDIAN. At one of the tables, 	a FARIAN man and a HUMAN are playing an alien CARD 	GAME. The Farian has some sort of TUBE running into 	one of his nostrils -- as he deals the cards, he takes 	a whiff of whatever substance the apparatus is feeding 	him.	We take in this scene for a moment, then MOVE TO REVEAL 	an unlikely customer sitting alone at the bar -- MILES 	O'BRIEN. He is UNSHAVEN and is wearing CIVILIAN CLOTHES 	suitable for a man used to working with his hands. 	He's fiddling with a small piece of broken HARDWARE, 	using non-Starfleet TOOLS from a beaten-up TOOLKIT at 	his side.	We'll come to learn that O'Brien has been on an 	undercover mission for several weeks, trying to 	infiltrate the Orion Syndicate. He's posing as a 	traveling handyman for hire -- just a guy trying to 	scrape together enough work to book passage off-world. 	He's been hanging out at this bar because he's learned 	that it's a haunt for certain low-ranking Syndicate 	members.	Three of them are sitting at a nearby table. LIAM 	BILBY, a human in his late forties, is the leader of 	the trio.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor... " - REV. 12/17/97 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED:	He has a glint of mischief in his eye and is capable of 	great charm, but his years of working in the Syndicate 	have toughened him and taught him to be wary.	FLITH, a Farian with a nervous energy, and KROLE, a 	dangerous-looking Alien with a brooding look, are his	right-hand men. They're talking quietly about some 	situation that has them concerned, and O'Brien 	surreptitiously tries to listen in on their 	conversation.					FLITH 				(worried) 			Raimus isn't going to be happy 			about this.					KROLE 				(to Bilby) 			What are you going to do?					BILBY 			I don't know. 				(beat) 			And don't you mean what are we			going to do?					KROLE 				(shrugs) 			Raimus told you to get the 			merchandise.	Despite the fact that Krole and Flith work for Bilby, 	they have an uneasy relationship built on a lack of 	trust -- Krole almost enjoys seeing Bilby on the ropes.					BILBY			I'll figure something out.					FLITH			You'd better.					BILBY				(sharp)			I said I'd figure it out.				(changing the subject)			I'm hungry.					FLITH			Let's have Krellan food.					BILBY			Last time it gave me heartburn.					FLITH			That's because you eat too fast.					BILBY			I eat when I'm hungry. And when			I'm hungry, I eat fast.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor... " - REV. 12/17/97 - TEASER         3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Behind them, the Yridian starts to get up to head for 	the com-booth.					FLITH 			If you're not careful, that 			appetite of yours will kill you 			someday.					BILBY			Don't get your hopes up.	Bilby tosses this off, but we can see that underneath 	the veneer of friendship between these men, there's 	always that element of tension and mistrust. Just as 	the Yridian approaches the com-booth, Bilby turns to 	him.					BILBY			We're using that.	Though they're obviously not, the Yridian backs away 	without argument -- clearly he knows these men are on 	their home turf.					BILBY				(to Krole)			Order some Nozala wraps.	Krole nods and moves to the com-booth.3    KROLE (VPB)	as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a DATAPORT 	like the one seen in "A Simple Investigation." He 	separates the unit into two pieces, places one on the 	com-unit, and inserts the other in a port at the base 	of his skull. The two pieces start to BLINK 	simultaneously -- Krole's eyes flutter shut as he 	interfaces with the machine, and the Farian INSIGNIA on 	the monitor gives way to a series of data-filled 	SCREENS.					KROLE			I've accessed the system...					BILBY 				(to Krole) 			Tell them to deliver extra Vilm 			sauce.					KROLE 			Who should I bill this to?					BILBY 			I don't care who pays, as long as 			it isn't us.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor... " - REV-12/17/97 - TEASER         4.3    CONTINUED:					FLITH			How about...				(smiling)			-- the police?					KROLE			No, we billed them for dinner last			night.					FLITH			Municipal Sanitation? Do you have			their account code?					KROLE				(smiles)			I will in a minute.4    O'BRIEN	makes a decision, surreptitiously aims a small DEVICE 	at the com-booth -- a BLINKIE flashes once, and we...									CUT TO:5    KROLE (OPTICAL)	Suddenly the com-unit overloads and an ENERGY TENDRIL 	arcs from the dataport on the console to the one on 	Krole's head. The monitor goes to STATIC, and Krole 	stands there, frozen in place, as if he can't pull away 	from the current.					BILBY			Krole.	Bilby and Flith leap up to help him, but before they 	can pull him away O'Brien intervenes --					O'BRIEN			Don't --				(pushing past them)			He's being spiked.	O'Brien works the controls quickly and the energy 	tendril DISSIPATES -- Krole's body immediately relaxes 	and he staggers back into Bilby and Flith.					BILBY			Are you all right?	They help him back into a chair --        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor... " - REV. 12/17/97 - TEASER         5.5    CONTINUED:					KROLE				(removing his dataport) 			That hurt.					BILBY				(to O'Brien; appalled) 			They spiked him. Somebody spiked 			him over a free lunch. What is 			this city coming to?	Krole looks at the burned-out dataport in his hand --					KROLE 			Look at this. Fused.	He slaps it on the table in dismay. They all look at 	it for a beat as if they can't believe their bad luck, 	then notice O'Brien still standing there.					O'BRIEN				(shrugs) 			Too bad. That's an expensive 			piece of hardware.					FLITH				(to Bilby, nervous) 			What are we going to do?					BILBY				(getting back at him) 			Don't you mean what is Krole going 			to do?					KROLE				(worried) 			I can't go to Raimus and ask him 			to pay for a replacement.	O'Brien can see that these men have a lot at stake in 	this piece of equipment --					O'BRIEN 			Mind if I have look?	The three men eye O'Brien for a beat, then Bilby nods.					O'BRIEN 			It might not be as bad as it 			seems...					BILBY 			Are you saying you can fix it?					O'BRIEN 			That depends.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor... " - REV. 12/17/97 - TEASER        5A.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					BILBY			On what?					O'BRIEN			How much are you willing to pay?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor... " - REV. 12/17/97 - TEASER         6.5    CONTINUED:	(3)	A moment as the men react to his moxie --					BILBY 				(amused) 			Do you know who I am?					O'BRIEN 			No.					BILBY 			If you did, you wouldn't be asking 			that.					O'BRIEN 			All right, then. Who are you?	Bilby's smile fades a bit --					BILBY 			Listen, Mister... ?					O'BRIEN 			Connelly.					BILBY 			I've seen you around the last few 			weeks. You're always in here 			tinkering with one piece of junk 			or another, which tells me that 			things aren't exactly going too 			well for you. So here's my advice --				(handing him the 				dataport) 			Take this and bring it back here 			tomorrow morning fixed and 			polished.	O'Brien looks at the dataport in his hand, then at 	Bilby.					O'BRIEN 				(shrugs) 			Tomorrow morning it is.	And with that, O'Brien moves to the bar to get his 	things. Bilby turns to the others, his genial self 	again.					BILBY 			Come on. Let's get some lunch...	Off this moment...6    INT. ALLEY - NIGHT	O'Brien is here to meet his contact in Starfleet 	Intelligence, CHADWICK.        DEEP SPACE NINE: " Honor... " - REV. 12/17/97 - TEASER        7.6    CONTINUED:	It's dark and narrow, and we can hear CITY SOUNDS from 	the nearby street. Chadwick is an ambitious fellow, 	eager to make his mark within Intelligence.					O'BRIEN				(showing the dataport) 			Bilby wants me to fix this for 			him.	Chadwick smiles, surprised to hear that O'Brien made 	contact with the Syndicate so quickly.					CHADWICK			I'm impressed. I don't think 			anyone's ever managed to make 			contact with the Orion Syndicate 			so quickly. How'd you do it?					O'BRIEN			I spiked one of Bilby's men while 			he was interfacing.	Chadwick is surprised to hear this, and a bit 	concerned.					CHADWICK			That was a risky thing to do.					O'BRIEN 			Maybe. But it got me noticed. I 			want to get this mission over with 			so I can go home.	Chadwick knows how O'Brien feels, and wants him to know 	he appreciates his work.					CHADWICK 			I realize you didn't exactly 			volunteer for this. Believe me, 			I wish we hadn't been forced to 			turn to someone outside Starfleet 			Intelligence for help.					O'BRIEN				(wry) 			Me, too.	Chadwick wants O'Brien to know something --					CHADWICK 			The Syndicate killed another one 			of our undercover operatives last 			week.        DEEP SPACE NINE: " Honor... " - REV. 12/17/97 - TEASER        8.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN 				(grim) 			That makes five in the past year.					CHADWICK 			We need you to find out who their 			informant in Starfleet is. Once 			you give me the name, I'll put you 			on the next transport home.	O'Brien nods -- he's counting on this.					O'BRIEN 			What do you want me to do now?					CHADWICK 			Bilby will check into your 			background. Everything he finds 			will confirm that you're a fix-it 			man down on your luck. Stick to 			that cover. The Syndicate is 			always looking for people with 			your skills. If Bilby offers you 			more work, take it. Get as close 			to him as possible.					O'BRIEN 			Right.					CHADWICK 			If you need anything, you know how 			to contact me.	O'Brien nods, turns to go.					CHADWICK 			O'Brien.	O'Brien turns back, and despite their contentious 	relationship, we get a glimpse of Chadwick's genuine 	concern for him.					CHADWICK 			Don't take anymore unnecessary 			risks. These are dangerous men. 			If they find out who you are, 			they'll kill you.	And off O'Brien's face as he takes in this warning, 	we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor...

A Farian WOMAN is at the public 	com-unit, engaged in an intense but hushed conversation.					BILBY			Did you fix it?	O'Brien nods, hands Krole the dataport, who studies it 	for a beat.					KROLE			Any feedback?					BILBY				(explaining)			Feedback gives him a headache.					O'BRIEN			There's no feedback.					KROLE			We'll see.	Krole separates the dataport into its two pieces, 	places one in the plug in his skull, and activates them 	so that the BLINKIES come on. After a tense beat, 	Krole nods approvingly.					O'BRIEN			I told you.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor... " - REV. 12/17/97 - ACT ONE       14.10   CONTINUED:					BILBY 			Very impressive.

Off his face as 	he stands to join Bilby...11   INT. BILBY'S APARTMENT - DAY 	as the door OPENS to admit Bilby and O'Brien. Like the 	tavern, the apartment is in one of the old-style 	buildings. What's more, the place is a wreck -- boxes 	stacked everywhere, discarded knickknacks, etc.					BILBY 			Have a seat.	O'Brien has no idea why he's been brought here, and we 	can see he's trying not to act nervous about it. He 	moves to sit on a nearby armchair --					BILBY 			Not there.	As O'Brien watches, a cat trots up and hops into the 	chair.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Honor...
