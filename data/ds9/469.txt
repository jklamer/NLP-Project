SISKO'S QUARTERS	SISKO is cooking dinner, humming quietly to himself, when 	JAKE ENTERS.					SISKO			Have a seat, Jake.  Dinner's almost 			ready.	Jake sniffs the air and smiles to himself.					JAKE			Let me guess, you convinced the 			Peljenites to exchange ambassadors 			with the Federation.					SISKO			How did you know that?					JAKE			You're cooking chicken paprikash.				(off Sisko's reaction)			You only cook Hungarian food when 			you're in a really good mood.	As Jake's talking, Sisko puts the food on two plates and 	brings it over to the table.					SISKO			I always said you were a smart kid.					JAKE				(smiles)			Runs in the family.	The two of them sit down to dinner.					JAKE			You know, I've got some good news, 			too.				(a beat)			Captain Yates is back on the station.	Sisko looks at Jake like he's not sure whom he's talking 	about.          DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - 03/08/95 - TEASER          2.1    CONTINUED:					JAKE			Kasidy Yates.  The freighter captain 			I told you about.					SISKO			The one you want me to meet?					JAKE			I really think you'd like her.					SISKO			Maybe I'll run into her.					JAKE			I could invite her over for dinner.  			How about tomorrow night?	Sisko can't help but smile at Jake's insistence.					SISKO				(laughs)			You're not going to give up on this, 			are you?					JAKE			Is nineteen hundred hours okay?					SISKO			I think we're getting a little ahead 			of ourselves here.				(before Jake can 				protest)			Look, Jake I know you want me to 			meet her, and I will.  Just let me 			handle it my way.	Jake sees that his dad doesn't want to argue about this 	anymore, and eases up.					JAKE			You're going to like her, Dad.					SISKO				(not entirely convinced)			You never know.	And as they dig into their food...2    INT. QUARK'S	The bar is busy.  ROM is behind the bar, mixing some drinks 	as a harried QUARK hurries over.          DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - 03/08/95 - TEASER          3.2    CONTINUED:					QUARK			The place is packed.  Where's Nog?					ROM			I gave him the night off.					QUARK			You what?					ROM			He's studying.  For his Starfleet 			exams.				(proudly)			He's a very dedicated student.					QUARK			He's a disgrace to his family... and 			to Ferengi everywhere.  He should be 			here, helping us earn profit, not in 			his room, learning how to be more 			like a...				(with disgust)			Human.					ROM			He doesn't want to be Human, Brother.  			He just wants to join Starfleet.					QUARK			It's the same thing.	By now, Quark has worked himself into a righteous anger.					QUARK			Don't you see?  This is how it begins.  			All it takes is for one impressionable 			youngster to join Starfleet, and the 			next thing you know, a whole 			generation of Ferengi will be quoting 			the Prime Directive and abandoning 			the pursuit of latinum.				(a beat)			It's the end of Ferengi civilization 			as we know it and it's all your fault.          DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - 03/08/95 - TEASER          4.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Rom reaches out and pats his brother on the shoulder.					ROM			Relax, brother.  Nog isn't going to 			destroy the Ferengi way of life.  He 			just wants a job with better hours.	Rom smiles at his own joke.  And as Quark makes a sour face 	at his brother's blithe disregard for the crisis at hand...3    NEW ANGLE	As a well-dressed officious-looking Ferengi ENTERS the bar.  	This is BRUNT, and as we are about to learn, he is a 	Liquidator (financial, of course) for the Ferengi Commerce 	Authority (essentially an IRS agent).	He glances at a PADD, then looks around the room, spots Quark, 	and immediately walks over to him.					BRUNT			You must be Quark.					QUARK			That's me.  What can I do for you?          DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - 03/08/95 - TEASER          5.	Brunt holds out the PADD so Quark can read it.					BRUNT			Brunt.  F.C.A.	Rom looks over Quark's shoulder at the PADD.					ROM				(scared)			The Ferengi Commerce Authority.	Brunt puts the PADD away, and walks around to the other side 	of the bar.  There he takes out an ominous black scroll, 	which he unfurls against the wall.					QUARK				(shocked)			A Writ of Accountability.					ROM			We're in trouble.	Rom is instantly in action, clearing the bar.					ROM				(to crowd)			All right, everyone.  The bar is 			closed.  Everybody out.  Go, go, go.  			Now, now, now.	And as Rom ushers everyone out of the bar, we hold on Quark, 	looking blankly at the writ, like it's the end of the world 	staring him right in the face.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - REV. 03/15/95 - ACT ONE       6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)4    INT. QUARK'S	The bar is now empty except for Quark, Rom and Brunt, who 	are all seated at a table.  Brunt is going over readouts 	from several PADDS, comparing figures and punching in notes.  	Quark and Rom watch him with concern from the other side of 	the table.					ROM			So, how do you get to be an F.C.A. 			liquidator anyway?	Quark glares at Rom.					BRUNT				(concentrating on his 				work)			Hard work, bribes, and sucking up to 			the boss.  Just like any other job.	Brunt inputs a few more figures into a PADD.					BRUNT			You've had a very profitable year, 			haven't you?				QUARK					ROM			(simultaneous			(simultaneous 			with Rom)				with Quark)		No.					Yes.	The two brothers realize they've contradicted each other and 	instantly change their tunes.				QUARK					ROM			(simultaneous			(simultaneous 			with Rom)				with Quark)		Yes.					No.	Quark pokes Rom in the ribs and then smiles at Brunt.					QUARK 			What we mean is, it's been a 			profitable year, but not as 			profitable as others.  You know 			how it is...       DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - REV. 03/15/95 - ACT ONE       7.4    CONTINUED:					QUARK (Cont'd)			... with the Dominion and the Maquis, 			people just don't like to travel 			anymore.	Brunt grunts his agreement, then does a few more calculations.					BRUNT			Are these all your assets?					QUARK			Down to the last slip of latinum.					BRUNT			You realize that concealing financial 			information from the F.C.A. can result 			in severe fines?					QUARK			I would never dream of trying to 			hide anything from the F.C.A.					BRUNT			We'll see.	Brunt continues his work.					QUARK			Could I look over those figures again?	Brunt shows him the PADD.  Quark makes a great show of 	studying it in detail, then frowns.					QUARK			Wait a minute.  That can't be right.	Quark thinks for a beat, then turns angrily on his brother.					QUARK			Rom, you forgot to include the profit 			figures for the tulaberry wine 			franchise.					ROM			But you told me...					QUARK				(cutting him off)			Go get them.  Now.         DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - 03/08/95 - ACT ONE          8.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					ROM			Yes, Brother.	Rom hurries off to do his brother's bidding.					QUARK			You'll have to excuse Rom.  He means 			well, but he can be a lobeless idiot 			sometimes.	Brunt grunts his agreement and holds out a PADD.					BRUNT			Please provide a dermal imprint for 			F.C.A. records.					QUARK			You haven't even told me what I'm 			being charged with.					BRUNT			No.  I haven't.	Brunt stares at Quark for a long beat.  Quark finally realizes 	what he's waiting for.					QUARK			Oh... How rude of me.	Quark reaches into his coat and produces a slip of latinum 	(this is a coin about a third of the size of the regular 	strips).					QUARK			For your trouble.	He hands it to Brunt, who accepts it without a second thought.					BRUNT			You're charged with violating the 			Ferengi Trade Bylaws... subsection 			one thousand twenty-seven, paragraph 			three.					QUARK			Subsection one thousand twenty-seven, 			paragraph three?  I'm not sure I'm 			familiar with that one.					BRUNT			In that case what you need is a copy 			of the Bylaws.       DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - REV. 03/15/95 - ACT ONE       9.4    CONTINUED:	(3)					QUARK			Which you just happen to have.	Brunt holds up a PADD.  Quark places several more slips on 	the table and Brunt hands it to him.  Quark quickly looks up 	the relevant section.					QUARK			Subsection one thousand twenty-seven, 			paragraph three.  Improper supervision 			of a family member?					BRUNT			That's correct.					QUARK			I knew it.  This is about Nog, isn't 			it?	Just then, Rom returns, carrying another PADD.					ROM			Nog?  Nog hasn't done anything wrong.					QUARK				(to Brunt)			You see what I'm up against?  I know 			that as the eldest male I'm 			responsible for the actions taken by 			members of my family.  But what am I 			supposed to do?  I told Rom not to 			let the boy apply to Starfleet 			Academy, but he wouldn't lift a finger 			to stop him.					BRUNT				(shocked)			Your nephew is going to Starfleet 			Academy?	Quark does a double-take.  He realizes he may have just gotten 	himself into even more trouble.					QUARK			Did I say that?					BRUNT			You're clearly incapable of 			controlling your family.					QUARK			If this isn't about Nog, then why 			have I been served with a Writ?       DEEP SPACE: "Family Business" - REV. 03/15/95 - ACT ONE      10.4    CONTINUED:	(4)	Brunt says nothing until Quark hurriedly gives him another 	strip of latinum.					BRUNT				(consults a PADD)			You are being held accountable for 			the criminal activities of one Ishka, 			daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar.					QUARK			Ishka?

All I have to 			do is get my mother to confess to 			her crimes and I'll be on the next 			transport back to the station.					ODO			Your mother?  What's she done?					QUARK			It doesn't matter.  The important 			thing is I'm required by law to get 			her to admit her wrongdoing, make 			reparations and reveal her 			accomplices.  And that's what I'm 			going to do.					ODO			Assuming she cooperates.					QUARK			She'd better.  I have no intention 			of spending my latinum to make 			restitution for her crimes.

FERENGINAR - MATTE SHOT (OPTICAL)	Ferenginar, the homeworld of the Ferengi, is a fetid dismal 	swamp, subject to a near-endless downpour.  The capital city 	of the homeworld rises out of the swamp, a series of dome-	like structures piled almost haphazardly one atop another.	One particularly tall structure rises out of a marketplace 	in the center of the city.  It's a series of domes, one 	stacked on the other, reaching to the sky like a high-tech 	Angkor Wat.  It's topped with a long, needle-like spire.  	This is the Tower of Commerce in the Sacred Marketplace, the 	center of all Ferengi civilization.9    INT. ISHKA'S HOUSE - MAIN ROOM	The main room of Quark's family home is a rounded dome, in 	keeping with normal Ferengi architecture.  The room is lined 	with display cases, bookshelves and holding racks, stacked 	with an endless assortment of pretty and valuable looking 	objects... jewelry, sculptures, scrolls, archaeological 	artifacts, you name it.	There are no windows, but there are a few doors leading to 	other parts of the building.  The doors are low and tunnel-	like and even Ferengi have to stoop to get through them.  	Rain from Ferenginar's relentless downpour can be heard 	beating against the roof.	Quark and Rom ENTER, followed by Brunt.  Each Ferengi deposits 	a coin in a collection box by the door, then removes a towel 	from a rack, and begins blotting off the rain.					QUARK				(a traditional 				welcoming ceremony)			Welcome to our home.  Please place 			your imprint on the legal waivers 			and deposit your admission fee in 			the basket by the door.
