OPS	KIRA and DAX are at their posts when the TURBOLIFT 	rises into view carrying two human men dressed in the 	twenty-fourth century equivalent of business attire. 	They are stern-faced and somewhat similar looking, 	although one is carrying a briefcase. They are Agents 	DULMUR and LUCSLY, of the Federation Department of 	Temporal Investigations.	Kira moves as they step off the turbolift and greets 	them with a smile.					KIRA			Welcome to Deep Space Nine. I'm			Major Kira.					DULMUR			I'm Dulmur.					LUCSLY			Lucsly.  Department of Temporal			Investigations.					KIRA			We've been expecting you.					DAX 				(sly)			I guess you boys from Temporal			Investigations are always on time.	They exchange a look -- these two guys don't crack 	smiles, even for pretty women.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and... " - REV. 08/30/96 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:					DULMUR 				(to Kira)			Where's Captain Sisko?	Kira and Dax exchange a look -- Sisko's in for a treat 	with these two.3    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	SISKO is carrying a mug of coffee as he moves to his 	desk. Lucsly is taking PADDS out of the briefcase, 	Dulmur is studying Sisko's personal effects with a keen 	eye.					SISKO			Are you sure you don't want			anything?					DULMUR			Just the truth, Captain.					SISKO			You'll get it. Where do you want			to start?					DULMUR			The beginning.					LUCSLY 				(somber)			If there is such a thing.					DULMUR			Captain, why did you take the			Defiant back in time?					SISKO			It was an accident.	Lucsly checks this off on his PADD.					LUCSLY 			So you're not contending it was a 			Predestination Paradox?					DULMUR				(explaining for the				laymen)			A time loop -- that you were meant			to go back into the past.					SISKO			Uh, no.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and... " - REV. 08/30/96 - TEASER      3.3    CONTINUED:					DULMUR 			Good.					LUCSLY 			We hate those.					LUCSLY 			So. What happened?	Sisko draws a breath, launches in.					SISKO 			This may take some time.					DULMUR 			Is that a joke?					SISKO 			No.					LUCSLY 			Good.					DULMUR 			We hate those too.	Sisko clears his throat uncomfortably, starts in.					SISKO 			Two weeks ago the Cardassian 			Government contacted me and said 			they wanted to return an Orb to 			the Bajorans.					DULMUR 				(to Lucsly) 			Orb?					LUCSLY 			They're devices of alien origin 			that are considered sacred objects 			by the Bajoran people.					SISKO 			Each has a unique property, like 			the Orb of Prophecy, or the Orb of 			Wisdom. The one we received from 			the Cardassians was the Orb of 			Time, although we didn't know it 			at first.4    EXT.

DEFIANT CORRIDOR	The Orb, in its protective tabernacle, is being carried 	down the corridor by two N.D. Bajoran Security Guards. 	Kira and ODO lead the way into one of the Defiant's 	quarters.					SISKO (V.O.) 			I had it secured in one of the 			crew quarters so we could bring it 			back to Bajor for authentication.6    INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL	as WORF brings in a harmless-looking elderly man in 	somewhat worn looking clothes. In reality, he is ARNE 	DARVIN, a Klingon surgically altered to appear human. 	He is posing as a human merchant, and calls himself 	BARRY WADDLE.						SISKO (V.O.) 			But before we left Cardassia, we 			took on a passenger.	As soon as the old man sees BASHIR and O'BRIEN seated 	at one of the tables, he rushes to them with joy on his 	face.					DARVIN/WADDLE 			Humans! I never thought I'd see 			another normal face again.	Bashir and O'Brien look up, a bit confused.					WORF			This is Mister Waddle.					DARVIN/WADDLE 			Barry, call me Barry.					WORF 			We are taking him back to the 			Federation. He was trapped on 			Cardassia when the Klingons 			attacked.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and... " - REV. 08/30/96 - TEASER      5.6    CONTINUED:					DARVIN/WADDLE 			I'm a merchant. I deal in 			gemstones, kivas and trillium 			mostly.				(indicates replicator) 			May I?					O'BRIEN 			Help yourself.	Waddle goes to the replicator.					DARVIN/WADDLE 			Do you know what Cardassians drink 			in the morning? Fish juice. Hot 			fish juice.				(to replicator) 			Raktajino.	We HEAR the sound of the replicator working. He takes 	the mug out and inhales the aroma.					DARVIN/WADDLE 			After six months, I was hoping the 			Klingons would invade. At least 			they know how to make...				(re: raktajino)			... coffee, even if they are foul-			smelling barbarians.	Worf glares at him.					DARVIN/WADDLE 			Sorry.	Darvin decides it would be best to move off and take a 	seat by himself.					O'BRIEN 			Don't take it personally, Worf.					BASHIR 			I rather like the way you smell.					O'BRIEN 			Kind of a... peaty, earthy aroma.					BASHIR 			With just a touch of lilac.	Worf won't respond. With a last glance at Darvin, he 	EXITS, much to Bashir and O'Brien's amusement.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and... " - REV. 08/30/96 - TEASER      6.6A EXT. SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL)	As the ship CLOAKS.					SISKO (V.O.) 			With the Defiant under cloak we 			left Cardassian space and managed 			to avoid being detected by the 			Klingons.7    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Dax is at the helm, Sisko is in the Command Chair, 	O'Brien is at the Engineering station. On the 	VIEWSCREEN, the stars streak by at warp. The LIGHTS 	indicate we are cloaked.					SISKO (V.O.) 			We were halfway home, and I was 			just starting to breath easy.					O'BRIEN				(to Dax)			-- trust me, the next time you see 			him, just sniff the air and say 			"is that lilac?"					DAX			Find somebody else. I have my own 			ways of torturing Worf.					SISKO			Don't look at me.	Suddenly an ALARM goes off on O'Brien's console.					O'BRIEN				(off console)			I'm picking up a massive surge in			chronoton radiation around --	Before he can finish, the Bridge suddenly DISTORTS and 	we see a strange MULTIPLE IMAGING EFFECT which then 	WHITES OUT the frame...									FADE IN:	The Bridge is quiet and everyone is sitting in the same 	positions seen a moment ago with dazed expressions. It 	takes them a few seconds to "come back" and get their 	bearings. The viewscreen has gone to STATIC and the 	consoles are flickering as if systems were only slowly 	coming back on.					SISKO				(dazed) 			What happened?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and... " - REV. 08/30/96 - TEASER      7.7    CONTINUED:	The crew struggles to focus and make sense of what's 	going on.					DAX 			I don't know, but we've dropped 			out of warp.					O'BRIEN			Sensors are coming back on-line.					DAX				(off console) 			Something's very wrong, Benjamin. 			According to the navigational 			computer... we're over two 			hundred light years from our last 			position.	The LIGHTS come UP as the ship DECLOAKS.					O'BRIEN 			We're decloaking!					DAX 			Someone's activated the 			transporter.					SISKO				(to Dax)			Deactivate it and get us back 			under cloak.					O'BRIEN			I'm picking up another ship dead 			ahead.					SISKO 			Can you identify it?	The LIGHTS go DOWN as the ship CLOAKS again.					DAX 			Not yet. But it's close... very 			close.					SISKO 			Chief, I need that viewscreen.					O'BRIEN				(working)			I think I've got it...8    ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	as the STATIC CLEARS to reveal an astonishing sight... 	the original Starship Enterprise, so close it almost 	fills the screen.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and...

SPACE - ENTERPRISE & STATION K-7 (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise is orbiting an old-style space station, 	as seen in "The Trouble with Tribbles."					SISKO (V.O.) 			She was orbiting one of the old 			Deep Space stations -- K-Seven. 			Near the Klingon border.13   INT. DEFIANT - ORB CABIN	One of the Bajoran deputies we saw carrying the orb is 	sprawled on the floor outside the door, Bashir is 	reviving him. Odo is scanning the room with a 	TRICORDER, Kira is examining the Orb tabernacle, which 	is closed.					SISKO (V.O.) 			Security reported that just before 			we were thrown back in time, 			someone stunned the deputy who was 			guarding the orb and broke into 			the cabin.14   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL - ON A MONITOR (OPTICAL)	where we see Darvin's face displayed.					SISKO (V.O.)			It didn't take long for us to 			realize who it was.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and... " - REV. 08/30/96 - ACT ONE     11.NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	to reveal Odo and Worf standing next to a wall monitor, 	briefing Sisko, Dax, Bashir and O'Brien on what they've 	learned.	Sisko stands at the back, his mind working, trying to 	piece together the fragmented information his team has 	unearthed.					WORF			His real name is Arne Darvin. He 			is a Klingon altered to look 			human.	Everyone exchanges looks, things just got more 	complicated.					DAX 			His surgeon does nice work.					ODO			We're assuming that he came aboard 			the Defiant for the express 			purpose of gaining access to the 			Orb.					O'BRIEN			Any idea why he brought us back to 			this point in time?	Worf works the controls and a picture of a much younger 	Darvin appears on the monitor.					WORF			We have a theory. This is Darvin 			as he appeared during this time 			period. At this moment he is 			aboard space station K-7, posing 			as a Federation official.					BASHIR			You're saying he's a spy?					ODO 				(nods) 			The younger Darvin's mission was 			to derail Federation colonization 			efforts by poisoning a shipment of 			grain which was -- which is being 			stored aboard the station.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and... " - REV. 08/30/96 - ACT ONE     12.15   CONTINUED:					ODO				(continuing) 			However, eighteen hours from now, 			James Kirk will expose him and 			he'll be arrested.					WORF 			That arrest will end Darvin's 			career. Klingon Intelligence will 			turn its back on him. He will 			become an outcast.					ODO			From what we've been able to piece 			together, he spent the next 			hundred years eking out a meager 			living posing as a human merchant. 			Then in a final indignity -- he 			was trapped in Cardassian space by 			the Klingon invasion.	A moment of silence as all consider what they've heard, 	then Sisko steps forward, starts to put it together.					SISKO				(a realization)			Until he heard rumors about an Orb 			capable of taking him back in			time...					BASHIR			So what's he planning to do?			Contact his younger self and warn			him about Kirk?					DAX			He could be planning to kill Kirk.					SISKO			The bottom line is we have to find 			Darvin and stop him before he 			changes history.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and...

The last 			thing I want is a visit from 			Temporal Investigations when we 			get home.					BASHIR			I guess we'll have to find a way 			to blend in.									CUT TO:16   A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS	showing glimpses of our people getting dressed, but 	never quite revealing what they're going to look like.	-- O'Brien pulling off his normal uniform...	-- a pair of hands pulling a black boot on...	-- Dax putting on makeup to cover her spots...     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Trials and...

Worf is wearing 	a turban-like wrap around his head to cover his Klingon 	forehead ridges.	O'Brien is working the transporter console with an N.D. 	Crewmember as the others look on.					O'BRIEN 			The original Enterprise used an 			old-style duotronic sensor array. 			If we wait for just the right 			point in the scan cycle, we can 			decloak the Defiant for almost 			three seconds without being 			detected.					SISKO			Is that enough time to transport 			us aboard?					O'BRIEN 			Barely.	Dax crosses over to them with a PADD.					DAX 			Here are the coordinates.
