SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)2    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR - MORNING	The door opens, out steps a Ferengi, KRAX.  Tough, 	authoritative, arrogant.  He checks the corridor.  Satisfied 	that no danger lurks, he gestures back into the airlock.  	Out steps ZEK, an ancient hunched-over Ferengi, features 	mysteriously obscured by a hooded cloak.  In one hand he 	clutches the supporting arm of Maihar'du, a tall bald humanoid 	alien.  In his other hand, he carries a staff, the handle of 	which is a smiling Ferengi head made of gold-press latinum.  	Together Krax and Maihar'du help maneuver the old fellow 	slowly down the corridor.3    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS - JAKE'S ROOM	JAKE is hurrying to get ready for school.  He's sitting on 	his bed, putting on his shoes, when SISKO ENTERS from the 	living room grinning with anticipation.					SISKO			Hey Jake, I've got a terrific surprise 			for you.					JAKE				(smiling)			Oh yeah, what is it?					SISKO			The two of us are going to Bajor... 			for the start of the Gratitude 			Festival.					JAKE			What's the Gratitude Festival?					SISKO			It's the biggest Bajoran holiday of 			the year.  Major Kira says it's pretty 			spectacular.           DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - TEASER           2.3    CONTINUED:					SISKO				(the icing on the 				cake)			And, I figured while we were on the 			surface, we could visit those fire 			caverns you've been wanting to see.	Jake crosses to his desk.  Begins stuffing a school bag with 	PADDS.					JAKE			Sounds great.  When do we leave?					SISKO			This afternoon.  Right after school.					JAKE				(smile disappearing)			For how long?					SISKO			Three days.					JAKE			Three days!	He grabs his bag and EXITS into...3A   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS - THE LIVING ROOM	Sisko follows.  Jake stops off at the replicator.					JAKE			Orange juice.	We do not see the juice actually materialize.  Jake removes 	the glass from the replicator, takes a sip.					JAKE				(to Sisko)			Do I have to go?	Sisko's caught off-guard by the question.  He had assumed 	Jake would leap at the chance.					SISKO			Well... no... not if you don't want 			to.           DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - TEASER           3.3A   CONTINUED:					JAKE				(relieved)			Thanks, Dad.	Jake finishes gulping down his juice, while Sisko struggles 	to hide his disappointment.					JAKE			Nog and I kinda have plans for 			tomorrow.	Jake starts toward the door.					SISKO			What kind of plans?					JAKE			There's an Andorian freighter due in 			for a maintenance check tomorrow 			night.					SISKO			So?					JAKE			It's supposed to be carrying a 			shipment of those new anti-grav 			tractors and we're hoping we'll get 			a chance to see one.					SISKO			Let me get this straight.  You'd 			rather hang around a cargo bay with 			Nog than visit the Bajoran fire 			caverns with your old man?					JAKE				(simply)			Nog's my friend.	And he's off to school.4    HOLD ON SISKO	Trying to figure out his son.           DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - TEASER          3A.5    INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR	Krax, Zek and Maihar'du continue along at their snails pace.6    INT. QUARK'S	The usual crowd.  By the bar, QUARK is glad-handing an 	attractive Bajoran woman.					QUARK				(all smiles)			No need to thank me, Madam.  Here at 			Quark's customer satisfaction is our 			primary concern.				(pointing the way)			Now you run along back to the dabo 			table.	She heads off towards the table.  Quark's smile disappears 	as...7    NEW ANGLE	He spots ROM trying to sneak past.  Quark grabs him by the 	arm.					QUARK				(gesturing towards 				the Bajoran woman)			Rom, that lady tells me she misplaced 			a fat currency pouch.					ROM				(abashed)			Yes, brother.           DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - TEASER           4.7    CONTINUED:					QUARK				(a slow burn)			And that you found it.					ROM			Yes, brother.					QUARK			And that you returned it to her 			intact.					ROM				(apologetic)			I was dazzled by her beauty.					QUARK				(exploding)			You worthless, tiny eared fool!  			Don't you know the First Rule of 			Acquisition?					ROM			Yes, brother.					QUARK			Then say it.					ROM				(reciting)			"Once you have their money... you 			never give it back."					QUARK			Exactly.  You can ponder its meaning 			this evening while polishing every 			rail in the place.  Now get out of 			my sight before I toss you out the 			nearest airlock.	Rom doesn't have to be told twice.8    NEW ANGLE	on NOG seated at a back table, building a tower out of small 	bar glasses and his school PADDS.					ROM (V.O.)			Nog!	A startled Nog knocks over the structure, sending glasses and 	PADDS crashing to the floor.           DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - TEASER           5.8    CONTINUED:					ROM			Is this what they teach you at that 			human school of yours?  Sloth and 			indolence...					NOG			No, father.					ROM			We'll see about that.  Tonight you'll 			polish every rail in the place until 			they sparkle.  Is that clear?					NOG			Yes, father.  Tonight, every rail.	Nog picks up his school PADD and heads for the hills.9    INT. PROMENADE	Krax, Zek and Maihar'du continue their inexorable journey.10   INT. QUARK'S	Quark is at the bar with Morn and some human and Bajoran 	customers.					QUARK			... And so the Andorian says... "your 			brother?  I thought it was your 			wife"...				(no response)			Get it... "wife!"	Now the laughter comes.  Morn will continue to shake with 	mirth throughout the scene.					QUARK			Had to think about that one, didn't 			you?11   ANGLE KRAX, ZEK AND MAIHAR'DU	as they make their way over to the bar.					KRAX			I'm looking for Quark.           DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - TEASER           6.11   CONTINUED:					QUARK			You found him.					KRAX			I am Krax... and this is my father... 			Grand Nagus Zek.	Maihar'du steps forward and removes the elderly Ferengi's 	cowl, revealing a shrewd, wizened face surrounded by the 	most enormous pair of ears this side of Dumbo.	Both Quark and Rom stare in awe.					ROM				(a whisper)			It really is him.	Quark elbows Morn in the stomach to silence his laughter.  	Then moves forward and kisses the handle of Zek's cane.					QUARK				(to Krax)			Tell me, is the Grand Nagus here on 			business or pleasure?					KRAX			Is there a difference?					QUARK			No, of course not.					KRAX			My father will reveal the purpose of 			his visit when he sees fit.  As for 			now, he desires the use of a 			Holosuite.  He's heard that some of 			your programs are quite... alluring.           DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - TEASER           7.11   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			Oh, they are.				(concerned)			But they may prove a touch... 			energetic... for his advanced years.	Off Zek's frown.					KRAX			Are you refusing his request?					QUARK				(nervously)			Not at all.  Not at all.  Is there a 			particular... activity... he'd like 			to sample?	Zek's frown deepens.					KRAX			The Nagus dislikes having to choose 			between so many delightful 			possibilities.	Quark reaches behind the bar for a PADD.					QUARK			In that case, here's a list of five 			programs that rank among my personal 			favorites.  I'd be happy to select 			one for him.	Krax looks at Zek who nods enigmatically.					KRAX			That won't be necessary.  The Nagus 			has decided to try all five.	Quark looks over at Zek, who breaks into a lecherous grin.	AND AS QUARK AND ROM REACT WE:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - ACT ONE           8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)12   INT. SCHOOLROOM	Jake, Nog and the other students (six Bajorans, three humans, 	one alien, ranging in ages from six to fourteen) chatter 	away at one another.  Hold for a beat... then O'BRIEN hurries 	into the room, holding a couple of school PADDS.					O'BRIEN			Sorry I'm late.  But the Transporter 			in Ops needed a minor adjustment in 			its upper molecular imaging scanner...	Realizes no one's paying attention.					O'BRIEN			... but never mind that.				(a beat)			Alright, let's settle down.	Nog continues to whisper to Jake.					O'BRIEN			Jake... Nog...	Jake looks up.  Nog continues talking.					O'BRIEN			Nog!	Jake gestures to Nog to be quiet.  Nog shuts up.					O'BRIEN			Thank you.	He stares around at the students.  They stare back.  He's 	definitely uncomfortable in his new role as teacher.					O'BRIEN			Now, we only have to get through 			another two weeks before Mrs. O'Brien 			returns from Earth.  That shouldn't 			be too difficult, right?	The students look slightly dubious.  So is O'Brien.          DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - ACT ONE           9.12   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Right.  Let's take out our homework 			padds.  We'll begin with the older 			students.				(checking his PADD)			Your last assignment was to write an 			essay defining the term "ethics."			We'll begin with...	He spots Nog slumping down in his seat.					O'BRIEN			Nog.	Reluctantly pulling himself back up in his chair.					NOG			I don't have my essay.					O'BRIEN				(not surprised)			Why not?					NOG				(without missing a 				beat)			My padd was stolen.					O'BRIEN			Is that a fact?  Any idea who did 			it?					NOG			It happened in Quark's.  I left it 			on a table... and there were some 			Vulcans nearby...					O'BRIEN			Hold on... are you claiming Vulcans 			stole your homework?!					NOG			Yes, sir.					O'BRIEN			And why would they do that?	Good question.  Nog takes a shot at it.					NOG			Because they have no ethics?	The class breaks into giggles.					O'BRIEN			All right, that's enough.          DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - ACT ONE          10.12   CONTINUED:	(2)					NOG			It's the truth.  Ask Jake... he was 			with me.	O'Brien looks over at Jake.  Jake isn't sure how to answer.  	He doesn't want to get his friend into trouble, but he doesn't 	want to lie to O'Brien either.					NOG				(to Jake)			Go on.  Tell him.					JAKE				(to O'Brien)			I guess so.					O'BRIEN			You guess so?	Jake looks at Nog who silently urges him to confirm his story.					JAKE			Yeah... they took it.  I was there.	O'Brien is surprised by Jake's response but decides not to 	press the issue.					O'BRIEN				(to Nog)			All right, but I want that essay turned 			in tomorrow.  Is that understood?					NOG			Yes.					O'BRIEN			I hope so.13   ANGLE JAKE	Feeling guilty as Nog grins his thanks.          DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - ACT ONE         10A.14   INT. QUARK'S - THREE HOURS LATER	Krax and Quark look up at the Holosuites.  Maihar'du stands 	guard before one of the doors.					QUARK				(uneasy)			Did the Nagus happen to mention how 			long he'd be using the holosuite?					KRAX			The Nagus will be done when he is 			done.					QUARK			But what if he injured himself?					KRAX			My father left specific instructions 			not to be disturbed.  Are you 			suggesting we disobey him?					QUARK			Forget I ever said anything.15   ANGLE ON QUARK	as he moves down the bar toward Rom.          DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - ACT ONE          11.15   CONTINUED:					ROM				(marveling)			The Grand Nagus, here under our roof.  			I've never been so proud.					QUARK			I hope you can live on pride because 			that's all we'll have left once he's 			through with us.					ROM				(the light dawns)			You think he's here to take over the 			bar?					QUARK			Why else would he come all this way.  			He's going to buy me out... and for 			a fraction of what the place is worth.					ROM			You can always refuse to sell.					QUARK			Why didn't I think of that.				(angrily)			Idiot, the Nagus doesn't take no for 			an answer.          DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - ACT ONE          12.15   CONTINUED:	(2)					KRAX (V.O.)			Quark!	Quark looks up to see.16   ANGLE ON ZEK	looking exhausted but happy as he makes his way down the 	stairs.  Maihar'du offers him a glass of orange liqueur.  	Zek waves away the glass, picks up the bottle instead.  Drinks 	thirstily.  Then wiping his mouth with the back of a bony 	wrist, he pats Quark on the shoulder.					ZEK			Good program.	Quark manages a weak smile.					KRAX			My father requires rest.					QUARK			I would imagine.				(to Zek)			Please feel free to use my own... 			brother's quarters for as long as 			you're with us.	Rom knows better than to protest.					KRAX			That should be satisfactory.					QUARK				(hoping for a "no")			Now is there anything else I can do 			to make your stay a pleasant one?					ZEK			Invite me to dinner.					QUARK			I would be honored.	Rom leads Zek and the others away.	HOLD on Quark, one miserable Ferengi.          DEEP SPACE: "The Nagus" - REV. 1/07/93 - ACT ONE          13.16A  INT. OPS - ENGINEERING - THE TURBOLIFT	O'Brien is working inside the Turbolift, which is stuck between 	levels.
