It's not so easy 			when it comes down to our level.  			Lieutenant Bilecki here is engaged 			to a young man from Bajor...				(she acknowledges 				sadly)			Ensign Kelly's daughter and a Bajoran 			girl worked together on a prize-			winning science fair project...				(Ensign Kelly nods)			All of us who've served on this 			station for the past year have made 			Bajoran friends; we've come to care 			about what happens to these people.          DEEP SPACE: "The Siege" - REV. 07/20/93 - TEASER           2.2    CONTINUED:					SISKO			I know I do.

I'm 			staying... I'll be here... You can 			count on me, sir...					SISKO			Before you volunteer too quickly, 			understand what you're in for.  We'll 			be trying to delay the takeover of 			the station as long as possible... 			hopefully as long as it takes to 			expose the Cardassian involvement in 			all this.  It won't be easy.  These 			Bajoran assault forces have been 			told the Federation is their blood 			enemy.  Jaro and The Circle would 			love nothing better than to present 			my head... and yours... to the Chamber 			of Ministers.  This is the last chance 			to leave here in one piece.  Some of 			you have families.  Some of you are 			on temporary assignment.  I wouldn't 			blame anyone for getting out now 			while you can.  I mean that.          DEEP SPACE: "The Siege" - REV. 07/20/93 - TEASER           3.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO				(beat)			Anyone who wants to evacuate is 			dismissed.	He looks them over and waits... none of them move toward the 	door... after several beats and an inspiring music cue, Sisko 	nods thank-you.					SISKO				(more softly)			Non-Bajorans won't be safe here... 			our families, children have to be 			evacuated... I'm sure many of the 			Bajorans who have worked with us 			will want to leave too.  There's a 			lot to get done.  The assault vessels 			will be here in less than five hours.				(beat)			Dismissed.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                      DEEP SPACE: "The Siege" - 07/15/93 - ACT ONE             4.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)3    INT.
