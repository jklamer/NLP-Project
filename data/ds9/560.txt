SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	There are numerous ships moving about the station.2A   INT. CORRIDOR	EZRI, ROM, and LEETA are walking down the Corridor,	heading for the Cargo Bay.					ROM			What if I say something dumb?			Something that makes him			uncomfortable?					EZRI			Like what?					ROM			Like... "How's your new leg?"					EZRI			I think he's probably expecting a			few questions.					ROM			I just don't want to say the			wrong thing.	They stop just outside the door to the cargo bay.					LEETA			You'll be fine. But maybe I			shouldn't be there when he			arrives.					EZRI			Why?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - TEASER       3.2A   CONTINUED:					LEETA			Well... when he was in the			hospital, he didn't answer any of			my letters -- that's okay. I			mean, I'm only his stepmother.			He's going through something so			personal... maybe he only wants			his real family around.					ROM			You are real family.					EZRI			That's right. And you should			both just relax. Yes, Nog has			lost a leg and that's a traumatic			experience. But you're not going			to say or do anything that'll be			worse than what he's already gone			through. Just be happy to see			him and tell him you love him.			For today, that'll be enough.	Leeta's still worried, but she finally nods her	assent. Ezri hits the wall control and the door	OPENS. They EXIT to...3    INT. CARGO BAY/AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS	JAKE, SISKO, WORF, O'BRIEN, KIRA, ODO, BASHIR and	QUARK are waiting outside the airlock. As Rom,	Leeta and Ezri ENTER, there's a BEEP from the	airlock door.					KIRA				(off wall panel)			They've docked.	Everyone crowds around the airlock, eager to see	Nog. After a beat, the door rolls OPEN and several	N.D. Starfleet Officers stream out from the	transport. Once they've all EXITED the cargo bay,	there's a long quiet moment. No one else is coming	out of the transport.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - TEASER       4.3    CONTINUED:					SISKO				(to Kira)			You sure this is the right			transport, colonel?					KIRA			I checked the passenger list this			morning. He definitely boarded			at --					LEETA			Nog!	They all turn to see...4    NOG	slowly making his way through the airlock. He's in	uniform, with a bag slung over his shoulder and	carrying a PADD. He's also walking with a cane and	limping noticeably.5    RESUME	As our people react with surprise. It takes a	moment, but Ezri recovers first. She begins	CLAPPING and the others quickly join in. By the	time Nog makes it out of the airlock, everyone is	clapping and CHEERING him on. Rom and Leeta give	him hugs and the others all crowd around, clapping	him on the back, shaking his hand, etc.					ALL			Welcome home! We love you! You			look great! It's so good to have			you back! Welcome back! The			station wasn't the same without			you! Etc.	The congratulations and back-slapping recede after a	few minutes and everyone takes a step back to hear	what Nog has to say. He's clearly uncomfortable	with all the attention.					NOG			Uh... thank you. It's good to be			back.				(hands Sisko the PADD)			My orders, captain.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - TEASER       5.5    CONTINUED:	Sisko glances at them, tries to lighten the mood.					SISKO				(joking)			Medical leave? How can that be?					O'BRIEN			Sounds like an excuse to loaf			around while the rest of us are			working.					BASHIR			Work and lots of it, that's my			prescription.					WORF			The Defiant plasma conduits could			use an overhaul.					QUARK			My drink replicator could use			some work.					ODO			Captain, maybe he forged those			orders.					SISKO			I'm afraid they're genuine.			Ensign Nog has no duties until			further notice. Except... to			attend a welcome home party in			the wardroom!	A CHEER goes up, but Nog settles things down.					NOG			If it's all the same to you,			sir... I'm pretty tired. I'd			rather just... go to my quarters.			Is that all right?	There's a beat before Ezri steps in.					EZRI			Absolutely. We'll celebrate			after you've settled in.					NOG			Great.	Beat.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - TEASER       6.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					JAKE				(re: bag)			I can carry that.					NOG			I've got it.	He manages a weak smile for their benefit, then	effectively ends the conversation.					NOG			Well. If you'll excuse me...	He heads for the EXIT. Leeta moves to go with him,	but Ezri motions her to stay. As our people watch	the young Ferengi officer limp away, we can see the	pain and concern written all over their faces.6    OMITTED6A   ROM & LEETA	watch him go.					ROM			Did I do something wrong?	Leeta's tearing up, but she hugs Rom and shakes her	head.7    WIDER	as Nog's friends watch him make his way slowly	across the huge bay...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only...

JAKE & NOG'S QUARTERS	Nog is sitting in a chair in his living room, now in	civilian clothes. The cane is nearby and Ezri is	sitting across from him.					EZRI			... and Julian and Miles have			become even more obsessed with			their Alamo program if you can			believe it. I half expect Miles			to start wearing a coonskin cap			to work.	She chuckles, but Nog barely reacts.					EZRI			You see... Davy Crockett wore			this cap made of... a raccoonskin			and...					NOG			I know the program.					EZRI			Oh.				(beat)			Well, I think we've covered just			about everything you missed while			you were away.	Nog nods.					EZRI			Is there anything you want to			talk about?					NOG			Not particularly.	Ezri nods, then her eyes fall on the cane for a	moment. Nog notes her look and lets out a long	breath.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE      8.8    CONTINUED:					NOG			Here it comes...					EZRI			What?					NOG			The "cane problem." You're about			to ask me why I need to walk with			the cane since Doctor Benbasset			told you my biosynthetic leg is			working perfectly. He also told			you the problem's all in my head.			That I'm crazy.					EZRI			He didn't say that.					NOG			It's what he thinks.					EZRI			Forget what he thinks. What do			you think? Why do you need the			cane?					NOG			My leg hurts. And if I put my			full weight on it, it hurts more.			So I have to limp. And that			means I need to walk with a cane.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE      9.8    CONTINUED:	(2)					EZRI				(nervous laugh)			Sounds reasonable to me.					NOG			Good.				(beat)			Look -- can I be perfectly honest			with you?				(off her nod)			I've spent the last three weeks			talking about my feelings with			the counselors on Starbase Two-			Three-Five... and to tell you the			truth, I'm a little sick of it.			I just want to be left alone for			a while.	She looks at him with sympathy for a moment.					EZRI			I understand. I think we've done			enough for today.				(stands)			I'll see you tomorrow.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE     10.8    CONTINUED:	(3)	She EXITS. Once she's gone, Nog relaxes noticeably.	He grabs the cane and carefully gets to his feet.	He stands there for a moment, unsure what to do.					NOG				(to com)			Computer -- what time is it?					COMPUTER VOICE			The time is eleven thirty-two			hours.	Nog thinks about for a beat then EXITS to...9    INT. NOG'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS	Nog limps in and sits on the bed. He looks down at	his artificial leg for a moment... puts a hand on it	briefly... then lies down and pulls the covers over	him. He reaches out and touches the control panel,	and the LIGHTS go OUT.	He lies there for another beat, then pulls a small	ISOLINEAR ROD out of his pocket and looks at it. He	puts it in a computer slot near the bed and hits a	button. Suddenly, the room is filled with the sound	of MUSIC and we hear the opening bars of "I'll Be	Seeing You" fill the room. As Nog closes his eyes	and listens to the music...10   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Re-establishing the station.11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Ezri is talking with Sisko.					SISKO			Jake says he's sleeping over			eighteen hours a day and Julian			says he's missed his last two			physical therapy appointments.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE     11.11   CONTINUED:					EZRI			And his counseling sessions are			going nowhere -- in his words,			he's "sick of talking about his			feelings." Can't say I blame			him. He's been under constant			psychiatric care for almost two			months now.					SISKO			So what do we do?					EZRI			I'm not sure. For now, our best			option may be to simply watch and			wait.					SISKO			Not my first choice.					EZRI			I know. But sometimes a patient			can help guide his own treatment.			Let's see what Nog does next.									CUT TO:12   INT. JAKE'S BEDROOM	It's the middle of the night but Jake isn't	sleeping. He's lying in bed, gritting his teeth as	the final bars of "I'll Be Seeing You" float through	the room. The song finally ends and Jake waits with	bated breath for a long moment. When nothing	happens, he smiles in relief and tries to go to	sleep. A few seconds pass, and then the song starts	up again. Jake groans and pulls his pillow over his	head trying to block out the music. But he's had	enough -- he flings off the covers and storms out of	the room.13   INT. NOG'S BEDROOM	Nog is lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling and	listening to the music when Jake ENTERS and hits the	control panel. The music STOPS.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE     12.13   CONTINUED:					JAKE			Nog, I want to be understanding			and I want to be your friend, but			enough is enough. You've been			playing that same stupid song for			three days. I can't take it			anymore.	Nog just looks at him.					JAKE			Aren't you going to say anything?			You've barely said three words to			me since you came home.					NOG			Maybe I don't have anything to			say.					JAKE			I'm trying to help you here, Nog,			but you're not making it easy.					NOG				(simply)			You want to help me? Fine.			Leave me alone.	Jake looks at him for a beat.					JAKE			All right. But if you want to			hear that song again, go rent a			holosuite.	Jake EXITS. Nog looks after him for a moment, then	sits up in bed and reaches for his cane...									CUT TO:14   INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT	Nog limps up to the turbolift and presses the	control panel on the wall. As he stands there	waiting, his mind reaches back in time...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only...

CORRIDOR	Where Nog starts a little -- but it's only the sound	of the turbolift doors OPENING. Nog glances around,	grateful that no one saw him... then steps inside	and presses the control panel. The doors CLOSE.17   INT. TURBOLIFT	Which is MOVING. Nog waits.18   EXT. AR-558 - NIGHT (STOCK)	Nog and his squad moving through the passageway.19   INT.

PROMENADE	The Turbolift doors OPEN. Nog hesitates for a beat,	brought back to the here and now, then steps out.	It's late at night on the station, and the Promenade	is empty. Nog heads for Quark's.22   EXT. AR-558 - NIGHT (STOCK)	Nog retreats back the way they came... then takes a	PHASER BOLT in the leg. He writhes on the ground in	agony...23   INT. PROMENADE	Nog is working the lock to Quark's with one hand,	and absently rubbing his artificial leg with the	other. The doors to Quark's finally OPEN and he	heads inside.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE     14.24   INT. CAVERN - AR-558 - NIGHT	Nog lying on the operating table, listening to	Bashir give him the bad news about his leg. Quark	stands nearby and puts a hand on his nephew.					BASHIR			... so in order to salvage the			femoral motor nerves... I'm			afraid I have to amputate your			leg just above the knee. I'm			sorry, but there's no other			choice.	Nog reacts to the grim news...25   INT. QUARK'S	Nog making his way slowly up the stairs.26   INT. CAVERN - AR-558 - NIGHT	Nog wakes up on the table. He sits up and looks	down at his legs -- one is clearly missing. He	hesitates for a beat, then flings the bedclothes	aside --27   INT. HOLOSUITE CORRIDOR	Nog's FIST slams into the bulkhead next to the	holosuite door as he tries to banish the images from	his mind. He takes a deep breath, settles himself	and begins to work the wall panel next to the door.					COMPUTER VOICE			Program is running. You may			enter when ready.	Nog EXITS to...28   INT. VEGAS LOUNGE	Nog ENTERS the lounge, where VIC FONTAINE and his	band are waiting in the otherwise empty room. Vic	comes over to greet him with a smile and a	handshake.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE     15.28   CONTINUED:					VIC			Hi there, pallie. Vic Fontaine.	They shake hands.					NOG			I know. I'm Nog.					VIC			You're Rom's kid, right?					NOG			Right.					VIC			He's really proud of you -- he's			always in here bragging about his			son, the soldier boy.					NOG				(awkward)			Yeah.					VIC			What can I do for you?					NOG			I want to hear, "I'll Be Seeing			You."					VIC			Sure thing, kiddo. Any other			requests?					NOG			No. Just "I'll Be Seeing You."					VIC			Sounds like it's a special tune.					NOG			It is. It helped me out once			when I was... unhappy.					VIC			What more can you ask from a			song?	Nog grabs a chair and Vic heads for the stage. PUSH	IN on Nog, who closes his eyes.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE     16.29   INT. CAVERN - AR-558 - NIGHT	Nog is lying there on the table, vacant-eyed and	lost in his own world. In the b.g., "I'll Be Seeing	You" is playing throughout the base. Quark isn't	sure what to make of it. But as Nog listens to the	song, he seems to relax... starts to get caught up	in the music. Bashir is checking over a PHASER	RIFLE and preparing to leave.					NOG			Doctor?	Bashir comes over to him.					BASHIR			Yes?					NOG			What is that?					BASHIR			It's a song I had Vic Fontaine			record for me.					NOG			Vic... ?					BASHIR			He's a character in a holosuite			program of mine. I thought it			might take our minds off our			troubles.				(beat)			Is it bothering you?					NOG			No. It's kind of nice...	Bashir moves off. PUSH IN on Nog as he listens to	the music...30   INT. VEGAS LOUNGE	Vic is singing away and this is the first time Nog's	seemed happy since his return to the station. As	Vic sings to his single audience member...									DISSOLVE TO:      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE    16A.31   OMITTED31A  INT. VEGAS LOUNGE	Later. Vic is still on stage, and he's finishing a	more swinging rendition of "I'll be Seeing You." He	wraps up the song with a flourish and Nog claps	politely.					VIC			Thank you.				(to band)			Take five, fellas.	The band heads offstage and Vic comes down to talk	to Nog.					VIC			That's it, kid. I know fifteen			different arrangements of that			tune and you've heard 'em all.			So, which one's your favorite?					NOG			The first.					VIC			Somehow, I knew you were going to			say that.	Nog smiles and looks a little embarrassed.					VIC			So let me guess -- Julian played			it for you, right?					NOG			Right.					VIC			If I had him as a publicist I'd			be bigger than Elvis.					NOG			Who?					VIC			Never mind.				(beat)			So how's the new leg?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only... " - REV. 10/26/98 - ACT ONE     17.31A  CONTINUED:					NOG				(surprised)			You know about that?					VIC			People talk.	Nog flexes the leg carefully for a moment.					NOG			If you really want to know...			it hurts.					VIC			Can they give you something for			that?					NOG			No, they say it's all in my head.			"According to my tricorder, the			pain receptors in your leg aren't			being stimulated, Nog. You must			be imagining it." But I don't			care what they say, it hurts all			the time.					VIC			I believe you.					NOG			You're the only one.	Beat.					VIC			So what else can I do for you?			Sing it again?	Nog shakes his head.					VIC			Good. To tell you the truth, I			was starting to get a little sick			of it myself. How 'bout			something else?					NOG			No... all I want to do is go to			bed.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "It's Only...
