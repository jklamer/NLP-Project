KIRA'S QUARTERS	Early morning. KIRA is hanging one of Ziyal's framed 	ink brush paintings on her wall. PULL BACK TO REVEAL 	two more of Ziyal's paintings already hanging on the 	same wall. The door CHIMES.					KIRA			Come in.2    DAX ENTERS	as Kira finishes hanging the picture and steps back to 	see the effect. Dax YAWNS, not yet fully awake.					DAX 			Is it my imagination or does oh-			six-hundred seem to come earlier 			and earlier?					KIRA			Either that, or you've been going 			to bed later and later.					DAX			I'd forgotten how... strenuous 			married life can be.	Kira and Dax exchange wry grins as Kira finishes 	hanging the paintings.					KIRA				(re: the paintings) 			What do you think?	Dax takes a moment to take in the Ziyal memorial wall.					DAX 			I think Ziyal was talented... but 			not that talented.	Kira tries to study the wall with a more objective eye.					KIRA			Too much?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:	In answer, Dax walks over to the wall and takes down 	two of the paintings, leaving a single picture. Dax 	steps back and stands next to Kira.					DAX 			There, that's better.	Kira has to agree.					KIRA			How did you know that was my 			favorite one?					DAX			I guessed. Come on, we're going 			to be late.	Kira nods and they head for the door.					DAX 			You really miss her, don't you?3    INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS	Dax and Kira emerge from her quarters and walk down the 	hallway.					KIRA			I'll get over it. Death and I are 			old friends.					DAX				(joking) 			Maybe he can be your date tomorrow 			night.					KIRA				(an old argument) 			I told you, I'm not bringing 			anyone.					DAX			I know what you told me, but 			people change their minds.					KIRA			Not me. Not about this.	Dax isn't about to let Kira off so easy.					DAX			What about Captain Boday?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - TEASER       3.3    CONTINUED:					KIRA				(surprised) 			You want me to bring Captain Boday 			to your quarters for dinner?					DAX			It's just a suggestion...					KIRA			A bad suggestion. One, you used			to go out with Captain Boday.			Two, Worf hates him. And			three -- as we have discussed many			times -- Captain Boday has a			transparent skull.	They enter a turbolift.					DAX				(oh, yeah) 			And you don't like to see a man's 			brains...					KIRA				(nods "that's right," 				then to com) 			Ops.	The turbolift doors close.4    INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS					DAX				(unfazed) 			What about Doctor Trag'tok? He's 			intelligent, a good physique, and 			he has a very opaque cranium.					KIRA			True. But his eye bothers me.					DAX			Which one?					KIRA			The middle one.					DAX			You really are obsessed with 			appearances, aren't you?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - TEASER      3A.4    CONTINUED:					KIRA			And your taste in men... frightens			me.	The two women step out of the Turbolift as they've	arrived at --      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - TEASER       4.5    INT. OPS - CONTINUOUS	As Kira and Dax head for the replicator. WORF and	O'BRIEN are manning their consoles as are the needed	SUPERNUMERARIES.					DAX			I'll tell Worf you said so.					WORF			Tell me what?					DAX				(to Worf)			Don't be so nosy.6    CLOSE ON KIRA AND DAX	at the replicator.					KIRA			Two raktajinos.  Extra strong.			And a Kava roll.					DAX				(sotto)			You could always invite Odo...	Kira gives Dax a reprimanding look.					DAX			... as a friend.					KIRA				(quietly, but firmly)			I'm not ready for that. Odo's not			ready for that. Let's just forget			you ever brought it up. I'm			coming to dinner -- alone.			Got it?					DAX			I got it. Three place settings.					KIRA				(handing Dax her cup)			I'll bring the wine.	Kira moves off to her station.7    AT ENGINEERING	O'Brien reacts to a console display, works his panel.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - TEASER       5.7  CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 				(to com) 			Captain, you'd better get out here.	Dax's attention snaps to her console... she quickly 	manipulates the controls. SISKO emerges from his 	office.					SISKO 			What is it?					O'BRIEN 			I'm showing a power buildup in the 			transporter buffer.					DAX			Someone's attempting to beam 			aboard.					SISKO 			From where?					DAX 			I don't know. There are no ships 			within transporter range.	Kira starts towards the transporter.8    THE TRANSPORTER (OPTICAL)	A kneeling humanoid figure (BAREIL) MATERIALIZES within 	the unit. His clothes are disheveled. A battered 	pouch dangles from one shoulder. He's hunched over, 	as if clutching a bad belly wound, concealing his face. 	He moans softly.					SISKO			Sisko to Bashir. We have a 			medical emergency in Ops.					BASHIR'S COM VOICE			I'll be right there.	Kira kneels next to the injured man.					KIRA 			Are you hurt?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - TEASER       6.9    THE MYSTERY VISITOR	As if in response to Kira's question, he puts the 	muzzle of a disruptor against her stomach.					BAREIL 			No, but you will be, unless you 			do exactly what I say.	Their eyes lock. His face is streaked with dirt, but 	there's no mistaking that face... it's the face of 	Vedek Bareil, Kira's long-dead Bajoran lover.10   KIRA	stares, stunned.					KIRA 			It can't be... 	And off her expression, we:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE      7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)11   INT. OPS - CONTINUOUS	Bareil gets to his feet, forcing Kira up with him 	placing the weapon at her back and using her body as 	a shield.					SISKO				(to Bareil) 			What do you want?					BAREIL 			A fast ship would be nice.					SISKO				(tapping his combadge) 			Security, we have a hostage 			situation. Clear a path to 			Landing Pad A. Authorization 			Sisko seven-one-green.					ODO'S COM VOICE 			Seven-one-green acknowledged, 			captain.					SISKO				(to Bareil) 			Your runabout's waiting.					BAREIL				(to Kira) 			Let's go.	Bareil and Kira step off the transporter pad. Bareil's 	careful to keep his back to the bulkhead.					SISKO 			Hurt her and you'll never get off 			this station, I promise you that.					BAREIL 			Follow me and she dies -- I 			promise you that.12   BAREIL AND KIRA	move toward the doors leading to the corridor. As they 	pass Kira's desk --      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE      8.12   CONTINUED:					BAREIL			Hold it.	Kira stops in her tracks. Everyone tenses, waiting to 	see what he's going to do. Keeping the gun on her, 	Bareil reaches over and picks up the Kava roll and 	takes a ravenous bite. As they continue toward the 	doors, they pass the turbolift. Kira takes a step 	towards it, but he stops her.					BAREIL			Not the turbolift. Someone cuts			the power and we're trapped inside.					KIRA			I guess we walk.	They exit into --13   INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS	Kira leads Bareil down the empty corridor. Bareil's 	eyes dart around, sensing an ambush at every turn.					BAREIL			Your uniform... I've never seen			one like it. You're not with the			Alliance, are you?					KIRA			There is no Alliance here.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE      9.13   CONTINUED:					BAREIL				(smiling) 			Then it's true. I've crossed to 			the alternate universe.				(finishing off the Kava 				roll) 			Tell you one thing... I like your 			food better.					KIRA 			I take it you're running from the 			Alliance.					BAREIL 			Now you know the story of my life.					KIRA			And once you get your ship, what 			then?					BAREIL 			I find a place where I can stop 			running.					KIRA			Where's that?					BAREIL 			I don't know -- I'm making this 			up as I go along. Believe me, no 			matter where I end up, it's going 			to be a lot better than where I've 			been.					KIRA			I can believe that. I've spent 			time in your universe.					BAREIL 			I bet you were glad to leave it.	They come to a fork in the corridor.					BAREIL 			Which way?					KIRA				(pointing) 			That way.					BAREIL 			How many levels until we reach the 			landing pads?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE     10.13 CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			Fifty-seven.					BAREIL				(resigned)			Lead the way.				(an afterthought)			You don't happen to have another			one of those Kava rolls, do you?				(off her look)			I didn't think so.	They move down the corridor.14   INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR	CLOSE ON Kira and Bareil as they approach an airlock.					KIRA			We're here. Landing Pad A.					BAREIL			Open it.					KIRA			I have a better idea	Kira turns around and faces him.					KIRA			Why don't you hand me that			disruptor.	Bareil points the weapon at her chest.					BAREIL			You've been so cooperative up to			now. I'd hate to have to kill you.					KIRA			You're not going to kill me.					BAREIL			You're sure of that?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE     11.14   CONTINUED:					KIRA			You're not going to kill anyone.			Not with that disruptor. The			power cell's cracked.	Bareil sighs, he's disappointed but not surprised.					BAREIL			How long have you known?					KIRA			Since we left Ops.					BAREIL			Then why'd you come with me?					KIRA			I needed the exercise.	A beat as Bareil seems to come to a hard decision.					BAREIL			And I need to get away.	Bareil lifts the gun to hit Kira over the head, but the 	Major parries the blow, steps in close and flips Bareil 	on his back with a judo-like move.15   ANOTHER ANGLE	Bareil hits the deck hard as the airlock OPENS. ODO 	and TWO BAJORAN SECURITY OFFICERS step up to Kira.					ODO			Are you all right, major?					KIRA			I'm fine.	They both look at the unconscious Bareil.					ODO			The resemblance to Vedek Bareil			is remarkable.	Odo looks at Kira for a beat, trying to determine her 	feelings towards the man that looks like her dead lover.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE     12.16   INT. HOLDING CELL	Bareil is seated, looking quite at home in his cell.					BAREIL 			This is the cleanest interrogation 			chamber I've ever been in -- and 			believe me, I've been in quite a 			few.	PULL BACK to reveal Kira, standing outside the cell.	Kira is holding the multi-dimensional transporter	device last seen in "Through The Looking Glass."					KIRA			I'm glad you're comfortable.				(re: the device) 			Mind telling me how you got your 			hands on this?					BAREIL			A Terran rebel gave it to me.	Kira knows he's lying.					KIRA			A multidimensional transporter 			device -- nice gift.					BAREIL 			We were very close.	Looking to change the subject, Bareil steps up to the 	forcefield, trying to get as close to Kira as possible.					BAREIL				(with cheerful 				anticipation) 			So, when do I get to meet myself?					KIRA				(taken by surprise) 			Meaning what?					BAREIL 			This is the alternate universe, 			correct? Everything's the same... 			but different. Which means 			there's another Bareil Antos here.					KIRA			There was.					BAREIL 			Was?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE     13.16   CONTINUED:	This is hard for Kira to talk about.					KIRA			He's dead.	Bareil can see the sadness in her eyes.					BAREIL				(a realization)			You knew him, didn't you? That's			why you seemed to recognize me.				(a beat)			What was he like?					KIRA			Does it matter?	Bareil can see that her feelings for the man ran deep.					BAREIL			He was someone you cared about.	She turns to go.					BAREIL			Major.	Kira stops and looks back to him.					BAREIL			I know I have no right to ask this			but you could do me a very big			favor --				(re: the transporter device) 			-- destroy that device.					KIRA			Why?					BAREIL			Because then they can't send me back.					KIRA			Sorry, I can't do that.					BAREIL				(with urgency)			Please, major. You've been			there -- you know what it's like.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE     14.16 CONTINUED:	(2)					BAREIL (Cont'd) 			Put me in prison... in a labor 			camp... whatever you want -- just 			let me stay.	And off this moment --17   INT. SISKO'S OFFICE	Sisko and Kira, both standing, face each other across 	his desk.					SISKO 			Let me get this straight, major... 			you're refusing to press charges?					KIRA			That's right. I don't think... 			Bareil ever intended to hurt me.	Sisko thinks this over.					SISKO 			I suppose we could just send him 			back where he came from.					KIRA			No.				(off Sisko's look) 			He doesn't want to go back to that 			universe and I don't blame him.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT ONE 15   -16.17   CONTINUED:					SISKO			I know what you're going through, 			major. When I met the "other" 			Jennifer Sisko, it was... 			confusing to say the least. I 			knew she wasn't my wife, but 			sometimes she would smile at me 			a certain way -- or the light 			would hit her eyes, and... she was 			my Jennifer. or at least that's 			what I wanted to believe.					KIRA			Captain -- I know this man isn't 			Vedek Bareil. He doesn't talk 			like him, he doesn't act like 			him... he's a totally different 			person.					SISKO			But you still feel a connection 			to him that you can't explain, 			don't you?					KIRA			It's not a problem.	Sisko looks at her closely, then decides:					SISKO			Good. Just see that it doesn't			become one.18   CLOSE ON KIRA	as she contemplates the captain's admonition, and we:									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     17.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:19   INT. PROMENADE	Bareil slowly strolls down the Promenade, taking in the 	sights, absorbing the world around him. He's also 	aware that he is being stared at by various Bajoran 	shopkeepers, kiosk operators and one or two passersby.	He stops in front of Quark's, drawn by the thought of 	a little liquid refreshment and relaxation in what 	appears to him as a very inviting bar.	But before he enters, Bareil spots Kira heading toward 	the Bajoran shrine, where the venerable VEDEK OSSAN is 	out front, ringing the chimes, summoning the faithful 	to prayer.					BAREIL 			Major!	Bareil hurries over to her.20   NEW ANGLE	as he catches up to Kira.					BAREIL 			I just wanted to say thank you for 			putting in a good word on my 			behalf.					KIRA			What are you going to do now?					BAREIL 			I'm not sure. I've been reading 			up on your world -- it's very 			different from the Bajor I know.					KIRA			Is that where you intend to go?					BAREIL 			I'm thinking about it.	TWO BAJORANS pass by on their way to the shrine, both 	staring at Bareil with surprise and curiosity, making 	him feel very self-conscious.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     18.20   CONTINUED:					BAREIL				(to Kira) 			Did you see that? People keep 			staring at me.					KIRA			It's because the man you look like 			was respected and loved by a lot 			of people. He was a Vedek.					BAREIL			A Vedek?					KIRA			A religious leader.	Bareil LAUGHS.					BAREIL 			Imagine that -- me, a religious 			leader...					KIRA			I'm glad you find it amusing.				(turning away) 			I'm going to be late for services.	Kira starts to move away, but Bareil catches her arm.					BAREIL 			Wait -- I didn't mean to offend 			you. It's just the kind of life 			I've led... it hasn't been very 			spiritual. In fact, I don't think 			I've ever been inside a temple.	This gives Kira an idea.					KIRA			Well, now's your chance. You're 			welcome to join me.					BAREIL				(surprised at the 				thought) 			In there? I don't think so. 			Besides, if I go in there, people 			are going to start believing I 			really am Vedek Bareil. And 			that's something I'd like to avoid.					KIRA 			I can understand that.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     19.20 CONTINUED:	(2)	And with that, she moves away toward the shrine.

Ceremonial candles light the area 	around him.					OSSAN 			Tolata impara no takash... with 			humility and gratitude, we accept 			this gift...	The Vedek turns to face the shrine entrance, raises his 	arms and calls out.					OSSAN			... Veshanoo yavar ha iktasho... 			the sacred Orb of Prophecy.	The congregation rises, turns to face...22   THE SHRINE ENTRANCE	where a pair of ACOLYTES ENTER, RINGING prayer chimes. 	Following them, TWO BAJORAN SECURITY GUARDS take 	stations next to the doorway.23   KIRA	becomes aware of a small commotion around her. She 	turns and finds Bareil standing next to her.					KIRA				(low, surprised) 			What are you doing here?					BAREIL				(whispering) 			I figured I could use a little 			spiritual guidance.					KIRA			That's not funny.					BAREIL 			It wasn't meant to be.	Kira looks at him intently.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     20.23   CONTINUED:					BAREIL 			I plan on making a new life for 			myself here and I'm going to need 			all the help I can get.	Kira nods -- she can understand his outlook. The eerie 	SOUND of the T'fan (a traditional Bajoran wind 	instrument that sounds like a haunting cross between 	an Australian didgeridoo and a Hebrew shofar) abruptly 	attracts Bareil's attention.24   THE TEMPLE ENTRANCE	The Monk playing the T'fan leads a small procession 	carrying an orb case toward the dais.					BAREIL 				(quietly) 			What's in the box?					KIRA			The Orb of Prophecy and Change.25   KIRA AND BAREIL	both face the procession, occasionally glancing at each 	other and SPEAKING IN WHISPERS.					BAREIL 			"Orb?"					KIRA			A gift from the Prophets. It can 			foresee the future -- or a 			possible future, anyway.					BAREIL 			That could come in handy. 				(a beat) 			Who are the Prophets?	This makes her smile.					KIRA			Our gods. You do have gods, don't 			you?					BAREIL 			Of course we do.					KIRA			You don't sound too sure.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     21.25   CONTINUED:					BAREIL 			That's because I leave them alone 			and they leave me alone.	From behind them, we hear a loud SHUSHING sound. Kira 	and Bareil look at each other, then revert their 	attention to the elaborate ceremony being performed by 	the Vedek.26   VEDEK OSSAN	stands at the dais, where the orb has been placed, and 	solemnly places both hands on the sides of the box. 	Closing his eyes, he begins to chant:					OSSAN 			Yelim cha ono... tarnah purono 			dhar jeek... teram far che... 			yavar ha iktasho...27   BAREIL AND KIRA	as she and the other Bajorans close their eyes and join 	in on the chant.					KIRA				(to Bareil) 			Close your eyes.					BAREIL 			Excuse me?					KIRA			Close your eyes.	After a beat he does, joining the chant as best he can.					GROUP 			Yelim cha ono... tarnah purono 			dhar jeek... teram far che... 			yavar ha iktasho...	And as we hold on the moment --									CUT TO:28   INT. PROMENADE	Bajorans file out of the shrine, Kira and Bareil among 	them. They walk together down the Promenade.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     22.28   CONTINUED:					KIRA 			Well, what did you think?					BAREIL 			I'm not sure. It was an 			interesting ceremony, but...					KIRA			But what?					BAREIL 			Everyone seemed to take it so 			seriously.					KIRA 			What's wrong with that?					BAREIL 			It must be nice to have that kind 			of faith. I've always preferred 			to believe in nothing -- that way 			I'm never disappointed.					KIRA			Doesn't sound like much of a life.					BAREIL 				(smiling) 			Maybe not, but it's all mine.	Kira smiles back, she can't help but finding this man 	charming.					BAREIL 			Anyway... I'm glad I got a chance 			to see you again -- it was very... 			enlightening.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     23.28 CONTINUED:	(2)	Kira nods. There's an awkward beat between them. 	Finally:					BAREIL 			Thank you, major.	He takes a couple of steps away before Kira impulsively 	calls out to him.					KIRA			Bareil.				(after he turns to face 				her) 			Do you like Klingon food?	And before he can answer, we go to --29   INT. DAX AND WORF'S QUARTERS	We open on Bareil taking a long gulp of bloodwine, 	mid-story:					BAREIL 			An hour later, the Klingon guard 			returned to my cell. And as he...30   NEW ANGLE	to see Kira, Dax and Worf seated around a dinner 	table, clearly entertained by Bareil's tale.					BAREIL				(remembering)			... put down my "last meal"...

Obviously, I was 			exaggerating.	Dax takes a serving knife and offers it to Worf.					DAX 			Would you like to do the honors?	But before Worf can take the knife:					BAREIL 			Allow me.	Bareil whips out a mek'leth from his shirt sleeve. 	Worf instinctively reaches behind his back for his 	mek'leth -- but it's not there.	Bareil then slices the dessert with two lightning-fast 	slashes, dividing the cake into four even pieces. 	Bareil then holds out the blade for Worf to take.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     25.30   CONTINUED:	(2)					BAREIL 			I believe this is yours.	Kira and Dax smile.					KIRA			What do you think now, Worf?	After a beat, Worf takes back his blade.					WORF				(magnanimous) 			Obviously, Bareil is a better 			thief than I gave him credit for.				(grabbing a flask) 			More bloodwine?					BAREIL 			Why not.					WORF 			Now I will tell you one of my 			stories.					BAREIL 			And I suppose every word of it 			will be true.					WORF 			Mostly.	Worf finishes pouring the bloodwine, and begins telling 	his story to Bareil.					WORF 			I was seventeen and serving as an 			ensign on the U.S.S. Hawk. We 			were two days out of port when 			this anomaly hit us --	As Worf goes on with his tale, Dax leans over to Kira.					DAX				(sotto voce; re: Bareil) 			I'll say this for him, he might 			not be as spiritual as Vedek 			Bareil -- but he's a lot more fun.	Kira smiles... she might not agree fully with Dax's 	statement, but she's happy to know her friends like her 	"date."      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     26.31   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR	Later. Kira and Bareil are walking back to her	quarters after the dinner party. They're not drunk,	but they are... relaxed.					BAREIL			You know you're a lucky woman?					KIRA			Why's that?					BAREIL			You have good friends.					KIRA				(agreeing)			They liked you.					BAREIL			You think so?					KIRA			Why do you sound so surprised?			You must've had friends back home.					BAREIL			I can think of one...	Bareil gets suddenly serious, as if a dark memory has 	taken over his mood. Kira senses this and probes 	gently:					KIRA			If you don't want to talk about			it...					BAREIL			There's not much to say. She died.					KIRA			I'm sorry.					BAREIL			It's all right, it was a long time			ago.	They arrive at Kira's quarters.					KIRA			This is home.				(a beat)			I'm sorry the evening had to end			on such a sad note.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     27.31   CONTINUED:					KIRA				(continuing; a beat) 			Would you like to come in -- have 			a raktajino?	And off Bareil's smile of acceptance.32   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS	Bareil is seated on a couch, drinking a cup of 	raktajino. Kira's seated next to him.					BAREIL 			Her name was Lisea. I first saw 			her on the street in Ilvia. I 			couldn't take my eyes off her -- 			she had the most attractive little 			money sack hanging from her waist.	Kira smiles is disbelief.					KIRA			Don't tell me you stole it --					BAREIL 			She should've known better than to 			carry her money so carelessly in 			Ilvia. It's a very dangerous place.			Turns out she had just arrived from 			one of the mining camps in the hills 			of Dahkur Province.					KIRA			I come from Dahkur Province, 			except here it's all farmland.					BAREIL 			When I met her she was working in 			an Ilvian pleasure center.					KIRA			And you decided to "take her away 			from all that?"					BAREIL				(chagrined) 			I taught her how to be a thief. 			The funny thing is she was so 			grateful. She felt I saved her 			life.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT TWO     28.32   CONTINUED:					KIRA 			Maybe you did.					BAREIL				(shaking his head)			If anyone was saved it was me...	Bareil lets out a long breath, he hasn't thought about 	this in a long time and he's surprised how much it 	still affects him.					BAREIL 			We were having dinner in a bar... 			a fight broke out. A drunken 			Cardassian pulled out a disruptor 			and started firing. The next 			thing I knew, she was lying dead 			in my arms...	Bareil's eyes are filled with deep sadness.					BAREIL				(continuing) 			We were together five years... and 			in all that time, I never told her 			how much she meant to me.	Kira gently picks up his hand and intertwines her 	fingers with his.					KIRA			I know what it's like to lose 			someone.	She squeezes his fingers with support. He looks down 	at their clasped hands, then up to her face.

She's half asleep, but Bareil, sitting 	on the bed, is holding a bowl of a grape-like fruit 	which he relishes.					BAREIL				(holding up a piece of 				fruit)			What did you say these are called?					KIRA			Alvas. They grow all over Bajor.					BAREIL			Not my Bajor.	Bareil pops another one into his mouth. Kira can't 	help smiling.					KIRA			I can't believe you're still 			hungry. After a Klingon meal, I			usually don't eat for two days.					BAREIL			Ever since I got here, I can't 			seem to stop eating.	Kira stares at Bareil with obvious warmth. After a 	long beat, he notices her gaze.					BAREIL			What is it?					KIRA			Nothing.					BAREIL				(thinks he knows) 			This must be very... strange for 			you.

BAJORAN SHRINE	Kira and Bareil wait together, alone. Kira is seated 	on a stone bench as Bareil paces.

I can hardly wait.	She looks to Bareil and sees his deep weariness.					INTENDANT 			You do look tired.

A large portion of the customers are 	Bajoran and their attention is focused on the bar, 	where Bareil is seated, finishing a drink. As QUARK 	walks by, Bareil flags him down.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT FOUR     44.45   CONTINUED:					BAREIL 			One more.					QUARK 			Coming right up.	Quark reaches for a bottle and pours Bareil another 	drink. As he does, Bareil catches TWO BAJORANS down 	the bar staring at him.					BAREIL				(temper rising) 			What are you two staring at?	The two Bajorans quickly look away. Bareil looks 	around the room.					BAREIL 			The same goes for the rest of you. 			I'm not Vedek Bareil. I just want 			to be left alone.	The other Bajoran customers go back about their 	business.					QUARK 			You heard the man. Now leave him 			be.				(to Bareil) 			I'm sorry about that. People can 			be so rude. You know I used to 			see the Vedek all the time, 			walking down the Promenade with 			Major Kira. Never came in here, 			though. I guess dabo wasn't his 			game.	Quark studies Bareil for a beat.					QUARK 			It is an amazing resemblance. Put 			you in a Vedek's robe and no one 			would know the difference.					BAREIL 			Believe me, there's a difference.					QUARK 			Not to the paying public.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT FOUR     45.45   CONTINUED:	(2)					BAREIL				(studying Quark) 			You've got a business proposition 			for me? Spit it out.	To Quark, that's an invitation from a soulmate.					QUARK				(confidentially) 			Picture this. You seated here, 			wearing robes. A long line of 			Bajorans waiting patiently to pay 			good money just to meet Vedek 			Bareil... maybe touch his hand.					BAREIL 			But like I said, I'm not Vedek 			Bareil.					QUARK 			A mere technicality. You're the 			closest thing to Vedek Bareil that 			they're ever going to see, which 			is why they're going to love you.					BAREIL 			I wouldn't know what to say to 			them.					QUARK 			The less, the better. Just nod 			your head every once in a while 			and smile benignly. It's simple. 			Later on, once you get the hang 			of it, you might want to throw in 			a blessing or two. What do you 			think?					BAREIL				(shaking his head in				weary disgust)			I've known people like you my			whole life. Nasty, greedy little			minds... willing to do whatever			it takes to make money. I know			just how you think.					QUARK 			That's because you think the same 			way.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT FOUR     46.45 CONTINUED:	(3)					BAREIL				(a beat; an admission) 			I suppose I'm a lot more like you 			than I'll ever be like Vedek Bareil.					QUARK				(hopeful) 			Perfect. Then we have a deal?	Bareil gets up from his stool.					BAREIL 			I'm afraid not.					QUARK 			Why?					BAREIL 			Because right now, I don't like 			either one of us.	With that, he EXITS. We hold on a puzzled Quark.					QUARK				(to himself) 			Shame to see such a good 			opportunity go to waste.46   INT. PROMENADE	Bareil leaves Quark's. He's angry with the Ferengi and 	angry with himself. He stops short, confronted by --47   BAREIL'S POV	of the Bajoran shrine.48   CLOSE ON BAREIL	feeling as if the shrine was sitting in judgment of 	his entire life.49   INT.

We see a Starfleet SECURITY GUARD stationed 	outside.					QUARK 			Major, any idea where they put my 			shipment of Saurian brandy?					KIRA				(indicating) 			Over there.					QUARK				(to the waiters) 			You heard her.	The Ferengi waiters begin to load the crates onto the 	cart. Kira holds out her manifest PADD for Quark to 	sign with his thumbprint.					QUARK 			Your new boyfriend came into my 			bar today.	Kira's in a good mood and she refuses to allow Quark 	to change it.					KIRA 			Did he.					QUARK 			He's a little different, isn't he?					KIRA			From what?					QUARK 			From some of your previous 			choices. Don't get me wrong, I 			had nothing against Vedek Bareil 			or Shakaar... but let's face it, 			they were a little too 			controlled... a little too 			controlling. They lacked fire... 			excitement. But this Bareil -- 			he's a different story. He's full 			of surprises.					KIRA			I take it you like him.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT FOUR    47A.50   CONTINUED:					QUARK 			Let's just say I like the idea of 			you with him. 				(a beat) 			But I'll tell you one thing, 			Major. You'd better brace 			yourself. You're in for a rough 			ride.					KIRA			What are you talking about?					QUARK 			I've been a bartender a long time. 			I've seen all sorts of customers. 			Happy ones, sad ones, complicated 			ones...					KIRA			And Bareil -- where does he fit in?					QUARK 			He's one of the... tormented ones.	This actually gets Kira's attention, she looks over to 	Quark to see if he's kidding. He's not.					KIRA			Tormented? I don't think so. 			You've had an Orb experience, 			Quark -- you know what they're 			like.					QUARK 			He had an Orb experience? 			Interesting.					KIRA			Meaning what?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT FOUR     48.50   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			After he left the bar, I saw him 			hanging around the Bajoran shrine. He 			must've been there a couple of hours.					KIRA			He has a lot on his mind -- he 			probably went there to think 			things over.					QUARK				(shrugs) 			Either that... or he was figuring 			out a way to rob the place.	Quark turns to see that the Ferengi waiters have 	finished loading the cart and are waiting for him.					QUARK			What is this, a union meeting? 			Let's get moving.				(over his shoulder) 			Nice chatting with you, major. I 			hope you two are very happy together.	And with that, he EXITS. We HOLD ON an uneasy Kira, 	clearly disturbed by Quark's observations.51   INT. BAREIL'S QUARTERS	As a grim Bareil ENTERS to find the Intendant dressed 	in Major Kira's uniform, waiting for him. She still 	has her distinctive headband on, which she takes off, 	completing the illusion.					INTENDANT 			Well? What do you think?					BAREIL 			Even I'd have trouble telling you 			apart.					INTENDANT 			Wearing the major's clothes... it 			feels so intimate.	The Intendant approaches Bareil, putting her arms 	around him.					INTENDANT 			Admit it -- you've never found me 			more exciting. It's like having 			the best of both worlds.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT FOUR     49.51   CONTINUED:	Bareil disengages himself from her grasp.					BAREIL 			Let's try and stay focused, all 			right? We both have jobs to do.					INTENDANT 			You're right, we'll celebrate 			later. Did you get the combadges?	Bareil takes out a pair of combadges.					INTENDANT 			Such nimble fingers...	Bareil puts one on his shirt and hands the other to the 	Intendant. The Intendant places the combadge on her 	uniform.					INTENDANT 			Contact me as soon as you have the 			Orb.					BAREIL 				(nods) 			Right.					INTENDANT 			You are going to look so good 			wearing a crown.	And as she smiles with anticipation, she kisses him 	passionately.

BAJORAN SHRINE - NIGHT	Bareil ENTERS. The place is empty and dark, except for 	the glow emanating from the Orb chamber. Bareil 	approaches the chamber security panel and begins to 	bypass the protocols.53   INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR	The Intendant approaches a cargo bay door. She spots 	the Starfleet Security Guard at his post.					INTENDANT 			Everything quiet?					SECURITY GUARD 			Yes, major.					INTENDANT 			Good. Carry on.	She takes a few steps to go past the Guard into the 	cargo bay, but he stops her.					SECURITY GUARD 			I'm sorry, but I need your level 			six authorization code.					INTENDANT 			Is that really necessary?					SECURITY GUARD 			It's the new protocol...				(by way of explanation)			... the war.					INTENDANT 			Of course.	Suddenly, the Intendant winces with pain.					SECURITY GUARD 			Is everything all right?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT FIVE     51.53   CONTINUED:					INTENDANT				(rubbing her shoulder) 			I must've pulled a muscle 			exercising in the holosuites. 			It's been bothering me all day.				(as if getting an idea) 			Would you mind massaging my 			shoulders?	The Guard is a bit uncomfortable with the idea, but 	before he can answer, the Intendant has eased over to 	him, practically burying her back in his chest.					INTENDANT				(playful)			I could make it an order...	The Guard begins to gently message her shoulder. The 	Intendant gives in to the feeling, closing her eyes.					INTENDANT 			A little harder, please.				(enjoying herself) 			Such strong hands... if only we 			had some warm Somata oil... that 			would be nice, don't you think?					SECURITY GUARD			I guess...	Suddenly, the Intendant drives her elbow into the 	Guard's stomach, pivots and gives him a blow to the 	back of his neck. He's out cold.					INTENDANT 			You have a lot to learn about 			giving a massage..54   INT. CARGO BAY	The Intendant drags the Guard's unconscious body into 	the bay, stashing him behind some cargo.	She then moves over to the transporter pad, takes out 	the multidimensional transporter device and starts 	working on the console.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Resurrection" - REV. 10/22/97 - ACT FIVE     52.55   INT. BAJORAN SHRINE	Bareil taps in a final code into the security panel. 	He then crosses over and puts his hand on the scanner, 	which activates. After a beat, the forcefield FRITZES 	OFF.	A thoughtful Bareil then steps up to the Orb box and 	gently rubs his hand over it. From out of his pocket, 	he takes out a handle-like device with suction cups on 	each end. He places the device on top of the Orb box, 	clicking it into place.					KIRA (O.S.) 			What's that old saying?	Bareil turns to see --56   KIRA	ENTERING the shrine.					KIRA			Once a thief...	Bareil mistakes her for the Intendant.					BAREIL 			What are you doing here?					KIRA				(angry, taking out her 				phaser) 			The question is what are you doing 			here?					BAREIL				(realizing who she is) 			Nerys...				(a beat)			... how'd you know?					KIRA			I didn't.

This is 	something she didn't expect, and it makes Bareil's 	betrayal even more painful.	Bareil steps over to Kira and takes the phaser from 	her.
