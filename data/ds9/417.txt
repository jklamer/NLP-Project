What sign?					QUARK			The one above the door.	Bashir squints in the direction of the door...					BASHIR			You'd have to stand on the bar to 			read it...					QUARK			Rules of the house.  I'm very sorry.  			Have a nice day.            DEEP SPACE: "The Forsaken" - 3/04/93 - TEASER            5.3    CONTINUED:	(2)	She grabs him by the ear and pulls him, grimacing with 	pain, to his full height.					LWAXANA			You're dealing with the daughter of 			the fifth house, keeper of the chalice 			of Rixx, heir to the holy rings of 			Betazed...					QUARK			Aah!  Not my ear, please...					LWAXANA			Yes, I know where it hurts the most, 			you little troll.

Odo nods pleasantly --					LWAXANA			But how did you know?					ODO			Dopterians are distant relatives of 			the Ferengi... it made sense that if 			you couldn't read Quark, you might 			not be able to read this charming 			fellow either.					LWAXANA			How perfectly brilliant of you.	Odo nods, pushes the Dopterian toward the door and as he 	EXITS with his prisoner, Lwaxana trains her eyes on him... 	and before he can escape, takes Bashir intimately by the 	arm, still watching Odo's departure with designs...					LWAXANA			Doctor, I want to know everything 			there is to know about your security 			chief...	Off Bashir's reaction...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   DEEP SPACE: "The Forsaken" - REV. 3/08/93 - ACT ONE         8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)6    INT.
