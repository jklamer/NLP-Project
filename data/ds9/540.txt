The 	stakes are large and the game has moved into the tense, 	take-no-prisoners phase.					DAX			Sell at twenty.					QUARK			Is that a joke?					DAX			Do I look like I'm joking?	Quark studies her face for a beat, then glances at his 	cards before making his next move.					QUARK			Evade.	He spins the wheel and then we MOVE to reveal WORF and 	O'BRIEN leaning on the bar and watching the action. 	They're the only "audience" in the bar and the game has 	their full attention. They keep their voices low.					WORF			She has him.					O'BRIEN			She's down fifty strips.					WORF			Not for long.					O'BRIEN			What makes you so sure?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:					WORF				(awkward) 			Jadzia... is playing a very deep			game. Her strategy will become 			apparent any moment now.					O'BRIEN 			I see.				(beat) 			You don't have any idea how this 			game is played, do you?					WORF 			No. But I've developed a new 			appreciation for it.					O'BRIEN 			Since when?					WORF			Since I married a tongo player.				(beat) 			And I am certain of one thing -- 			Jadzia will defeat that... Ferengi 			bartender.					O'BRIEN 			I don't know about that. Quark's 			on a roll. In the last month, 			he's won two hundred and six 			straight games.					WORF			Would you care to... make a wager 			on the outcome?					O'BRIEN 			I wouldn't want to bet against a 			man's wife.					WORF				(a shrug)			If you're afraid...					O'BRIEN				(quick)			Name your stakes.					WORF 			A bottle of bloodwine against a 			bottle of scotch whiskey.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - TEASER      3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN 			Done.	They shake and then return to watching the game for a 	beat.3    THE TONGO GAME	It's Dax's turn again.					DAX 			A sale at fifty... and I'm buying 			at one hundred.	She spins the wheel as everyone at the table throws 	down their cards in frustration except Quark, who won't 	be cowed.					QUARK 			Pretty big talk for a woman who's 			lost fifty strips.					DAX 			Afraid I can't cover my bets?					QUARK 			Perish the thought. I just hate 			to kick someone when they're down. 				(beat) 			I'll buy at a hundred. And 			confront.					DAX			Well, if you're going to kick me, 			I'm going to have to kick back.	She lays down her cards with a look of triumph. Quark 	looks crushed. Worf lets out a Klingon battle cry of 	victory from the bar --      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - TEASER      4.3    CONTINUED:					WORF			ESH-ta PAR-mach-KAI!!				(to O'Brien)			I like my bloodwine very young and			very sweet.	But the game's not quite over.					QUARK			Is he a friend of yours?					DAX			Just a fan.	Dax begins to rake in her winnings, but Quark stops her.					QUARK			I'm afraid I'm going to have to			disappoint all your fans.	He lays down the cards.					DAX				(oh, no)			A Full Consortium.					O'BRIEN			Two hundred and seven.				(to Worf)			Single malt. Preferably something			from the Highlands.					WORF			I'll need some time.					O'BRIEN			Your credit's good.	Worf heads for the Tongo table, where the game has now	broken up. Quark is carrying off his winnings and the 	other Ferengi are EXITING. Stay on O'Brien for a beat 	as he shakes his head in admiration and disbelief.					O'BRIEN			Two hundred and seven games...3A   ON WORF AND DAX	As Worf approaches.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - TEASER     4A.3A   CONTINUED:					DAX			Did you just lose a bet?					WORF			It is of no consequence.					DAX			Sorry about that.					WORF			I would rather lose a bet on you			than win on someone else.					DAX			Good response.	She smiles and kisses him.									CUT TO:4    INT. WORF & DAX'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM	Later that same evening, Worf and Dax are getting ready 	for bed.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - TEASER      5.4    CONTINUED:	Worf is coming out of the bathroom, dressed in his 	night clothes and his hair loose and out of the 	ponytail. Dax is also dressed for bed and is brushing 	out her hair in front of a vanity. Worf moves to a 	small Kahless shrine and begins to light one or two 	candles.					DAX 			Are you still running that drill 			tomorrow afternoon?					WORF 			I was planning to. Why?					DAX			I wanted to recalibrate the 			external sensors.					WORF			We should be done by sixteen 			hundred.					DAX			I think that'll work.				(beat) 			Oh -- the Sutherland's going to 			be here the day after tomorrow and 			I wanted to--	She stops herself as she notices in the mirror that 	Worf is now kneeling before the Kahless shrine and has 	closed his eyes in silent prayer. Dax turns on her 	seat and looks at him for a long moment. He makes a 	romantic image there on the floor, his face lit by 	candlelight and his hair cascading around his face. 	Dax drinks in the sight of her husband for a moment. 5   WORF	finishing his prayers. He snuffs out the candles on 	the shrine and begins to pull his hair back into its 	ponytail again.					WORF				(absently)			What were you saying?					DAX'S VOICE 			Nothing.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - TEASER      6.5    CONTINUED:	Suddenly Dax's nightgown hits him in the head. He 	pulls it off his face in surprise. He turns to see --6    DAX	naked and waiting for him under the covers.					DAX 			I don't feel like talking anymore.	Worf gets up off his knees and crosses to the bed. He 	takes his wife in his arms and we...									DISSOLVE TO:7    INT. WORF & DAX'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM	A few hours later. Worf and Dax are sound asleep in 	each other's arms when...					KIRA'S COM VOICE 			Kira to Worf.	Worf is instantly alert, while Dax burrows beneath the 	covers.					WORF				(hits control panel) 			This is Worf.					KIRA'S COM VOICE 			Sorry to bother you, Commander, 			but I need to see you and Jadzia 			in the captain's office immediately.					WORF			On our way.	He jumps out of bed, but there's no movement from 	Jadzia.					WORF 			Jadzia.					DAX				(muffled) 			Mmmm.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - TEASER      7.7    CONTINUED:					WORF 			Get up.					DAX				(muffled) 			I'm coming.8    ON WORF	as he pauses, then decides there's only one thing to 	do. He grabs the foot of the covers and YANKS them off 	the bed and Dax (who we can't see) lets out a YELL of 	protest.					DAX 			HEY!									CUT TO:9    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	A short time later. Dax and Worf (now back in uniform) 	ENTER -- Dax is stifling a yawn. KIRA looks up from 	the desk.					KIRA			We don't have a lot of time, so 			I'll get right to it. For the 			last two months, Starfleet has 			been receiving military 			intelligence from a Cardassian 			operative. That operative has now 			sent an emergency signal 			indicating that he needs to speak 			to someone in a face-to-face 			conversation.	She hands them a PADD.					KIRA			In thirteen hours, he'll beam an 			encrypted subspace transmission 			to these coordinates near the 			Badlands.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - TEASER      8.9    CONTINUED:					DAX 			Who is this operative?					KIRA			Intelligence told me his name is 			Lasaran, but that's all they'd say 			about him. They did emphasize -- 			several times -- that he's very 			important to them and we should 			get someone to the Badlands as 			soon as possible. So with the 			Defiant gone, and most of the 			runabouts off on exercises with 			the Ninth Fleet...					DAX			We just volunteered to take a trip 			to the Badlands.					KIRA			'fraid so. The Shenandoah is 			prepped and ready to go on landing 			pad "A." Good luck.	As Worf and Dax rush out of the room...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT ONE      9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   EXT.

After a 	few seconds, she hands it back to him.					DAX 			No.					WORF 			No?					DAX			No. I'm not going to spend two 			weeks hiking across Vulcan's Forge 			in the middle of their summer.					WORF			I thought you'd always wanted to 			see the Forge.					DAX			See it? Yes. Honeymoon there? 			No.	Worf frowns and begins working the PADD.					WORF 			Well... there is a mountain-			climbing expedition on Andor that 			caught my attention --					DAX			Worf? My love... ?	She takes his hands and tries to put this as gently as 	possible.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT ONE     10.11   CONTINUED:					DAX				(deliberate) 			Let me make this very clear -- I 			do not want to spend my honeymoon 			climbing, hiking, sweating, 			bleeding or suffering in any way.					WORF 			Then... what do you want?					DAX			Room service.					WORF 			Room service?					DAX			Room service. I want to be 			pampered. I want a staff to cater 			to our every whim. I want to be 			embarrassed by the size of our 			room. I want a balcony with a 			view that makes you want to break 			down and cry from the sheer beauty 			of it all. And I don't want to 			spend one moment of our honeymoon 			suffering from anything except 			guilt about our complete self-			indulgence.					WORF				(please no) 			Risa?					DAX			Not this time.	She grabs a PADD that's been sitting nearby and hands 	it to him.					DAX 			Welcome to Casperia Prime. The 			vacation capital of the Horvian 			Cluster.					WORF 			You have been planning this all 			along.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT ONE     11.11   CONTINUED:	(2) 					DAX			Seems fair. You planned the			wedding.	Worf finds that he has no answer to that. He struggles 	for a long moment... the effort apparent on his face... 	and then decides to go with it.					WORF			Very well. Room service.					DAX			Really?					WORF			Really.					DAX			That was easy.					WORF			Did you want to fight over it?					DAX			No. But I wasn't expecting you			to surrender so quickly.					WORF				(eyes flash)			"Surrender?"					DAX			Bad word.					WORF			Very bad.					DAX			Okay.				(beat)			But I will say that you've been			unusually... accommodating lately.					WORF			What's wrong with that?					DAX			Nothing. It's just... unexpected.			Are you feeling all right?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT ONE     12.11   CONTINUED:	(3)					WORF			I'm a married man. I have to make 			certain... adjustments to my 			lifestyle.					DAX			Adjustments? Worf, you've become 			almost... easygoing. I mean, 			what's next -- a sense of humor?					WORF 			I have a sense of humor. 				(off her look) 			On the Enterprise, I was 			considered to be quite amusing.					DAX			That must've been one dull ship.	He gives her a dirty look, then pulls it back in.					WORF			That's a joke. I get it.				(beat)			It's not funny, but I get it.					DAX			I don't know if I can get used to			this "New you." It's kind of 			eerie.					WORF 			Your problem is that you can't 			accept change.					DAX 			I can't accept change?					WORF			That's right.					DAX 			You've got to be kidding. I've 			changed bodies six times, Worf.					WORF 			Yes, but you are still very set 			in your ways.					DAX 			Look who's talking!     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT ONE     13.11   CONTINUED:	(4)					WORF 			I don't have to sleep on the same 			side of the bed every night.

Or lift the --					DAX			I get the point. 				(beat, dry) 			I don't know how you can live with 			someone so... monotonous.					WORF 			It's not easy.	She gives him a sharp look.					WORF 			That was a joke.	Beat.					DAX			This is going to be a very, very, 			long trip...	She nods and goes back to work at the console as Worf 	smiles to himself -- pleased that he's won this round.									CUT TO:11A  EXT.

Nothing moves for a long time... then 	there's a RUSTLING SOUND.38   DAX & WORF	react to the sound and peer through the bushes...    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT THREE    38.39   IN THE CLEARING	we can see MOVEMENT in the brush. Then more movement. 	Then finally a JEM'HADAR FIRST steps into the clearing, 	then a SECOND and a THIRD.	The First STOPS and then signals his men to stop as 	well. He looks around the jungle with a careful eye... 	then pulls out a SCANNER and begins scanning the jungle.40   WORF & DAX	never take their eyes off the Jem'Hadar.41   WORF'S FINGER	moves from the stock to the trigger of his rifle.42   THE JEM'HADAR FIRST	has completed his scan, and finds nothing. He puts the 	scanner away, but still doesn't move. Something's 	bothering him. The other members of his squad exchange 	looks, but none say anything.43   DAX'S HAND	tightens on the barrel of her rifle.44   THE JEM'HADAR FIRST	finally signals his men to move forward.45   WORF & DAX'S POV	The First will pass by their position, no problem. So 	will the Second... but the Third is heading right for 	them!46   WORF & DAX	exchange a glance -- there's no way around it, they're 	going to have to fight their way out of here. Worf 	indicates that he'll take the Second, and that Dax 	should take the Third. She nods and they ready 	themselves...    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT THREE    39.47   WIDER (OPTICAL)	The Jem'Hadar Third is less than a meter away from the 	hiding place when Worf and Dax OPEN FIRE.	-- Dax's first shot HITS the Third directly in the 	chest, killing him.	-- Worf's shot HITS the Second and kills him as well.	-- The Jem'Hadar First whirls around and unleashes a 	volley into their position.	-- Worf and Dax roll out of the way as the shots come 	flying in.	-- Worf rolls to his knees and throws his mek'leth into 	the First, killing him.	The whole fight is over in a matter of seconds. Worf 	is gets to his feet with a pleased look, then notices 	that Dax is nowhere to be seen.					WORF			Jadzia?	A low gasp of pain comes from the nearby underbrush. 	Worf RIPS AWAY the brush and finds her on her on her 	back, grimacing in pain and holding her side.					DAX			Painkillers... please.					WORF			Lie still.	She pulls her hands away -- they're covered in blood.					DAX				(gasping)			I can do that.	Worf finds one of their packs and pulls a medkit out 	of it. He scans her with the tricorder, doesn't like 	what he sees.	He drops the tricorder, pulls out a hypospray, makes 	a few adjustments then applies it to her neck.	The relief is instantaneous. Worf opens her jacket to 	expose the wound, then pulls out a field bandage from 	the kit and begins applying it to the bleeding.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT THREE    40.47   CONTINUED:					DAX			I'd like the good news first.					WORF 			No vital organs were damaged.					DAX			Now the bad news...					WORF			The disruptor burst left an anti-			coagulant in your system...	She reads it in his eyes.					DAX 			And you can't stop the bleeding.	His silence speaks volumes. She picks up the medical 	tricorder as he finishes dressing the wound.					DAX 			It looks like I didn't take the 			full burst... the hemorrhaging's 			not too bad yet. Just keep 			pumping me full of painkillers and 			we'll be on our way.					WORF 			Moving could make the bleeding 			worse.					DAX			Staying here isn't an option.				(re: dead men) 			Someone's going to start looking for			them when they don't check in. I'd 			rather take my chances on foot.	She holds out a hand for him to help her up. He 	hesitates, then pulls her to her feet as she uses her 	rifle as a crutch to stand. She grimaces a bit, then 	takes a deep breath, and checks her weapon.					DAX			Ready?				(beat, then hard) 			Ready?	Worf gives her a long, worried look for a moment.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT THREE    41.47   CONTINUED:	(2)					WORF			Ready.					DAX			Then let's go.	She winks strides off into the jungle.

JUNGLE #12 - DAY	Worf is standing on a tall rock, working a PADD, 	checking the position of the sun, and trying to work 	out their location. Dax is now wearing her jacket 	(unzipped) and resting on a rock, her phaser rifle 	leaning against her. She doesn't look good -- but 	she's not ready to collapse either. Worf is wearing 	his pack, while Dax's sits on the ground next to her.					WORF 			We're still twelve kilometers from 			the rendezvous point.	He moves to scan her with the medical tricorder. All 	the humor and banter is gone from Worf, and he's back 	to the stoic, gruff Klingon we've known for so long.					DAX 			And only twenty hours left. I 			guess it's time to stop having so 			much fun and pick up the pace, huh?	He closes the tricorder and opens the medkit. He takes 	out an oversized hypospray with a blood-red vial 	attached to the bottom.					DAX				(re: hypo) 			More plasma? No, thanks. I'm 			full.					WORF			Your blood pressure has dropped 			another twenty percent.	He applies the hypospray to her neck and waits as the 	vial drains itself (which we don't see).					DAX			Love that bedside manner. You 			should've been a doctor.	He looks at her bandage while the hypo drains.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FOUR    43.48   CONTINUED:					WORF			Your dressing will need to be changed soon.					DAX			I think I'd like a blue chiffon 			bandage this time -- maybe some 			rhinestones -- you know, something 			with a little pizazz.					WORF			This is not a joking matter. You 			are seriously injured and we have 			a great deal of terrain to cover.					DAX			Just trying to lighten the mood.					WORF			This is not the time nor the place.	The hypo is done and he pulls it away from her neck.					DAX			What happened to that new Worf? 			You know, the one with a sense of 			humor?					WORF			That was a mistake.	He stows the medkit in her pack and then slings it over 	his shoulder.					DAX			What's that supposed to mean?					WORF			It means if I had not been joking 			with you, I would not have let the 			Jem'Hadar get that close.					DAX			So this is all my fault?					WORF			No. It is mine. I was trying to 			be something I am not.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FOUR    44.48   CONTINUED:	(2)					WORF (Cont'd) 			By letting down my guard -- by 			ignoring my duty -- I allowed my 			wife to be injured and I put the 			entire mission in jeopardy.

Let's go.	He offers her a hand up, but she brushes it aside. She 	grabs her rifle and they head off into the jungle once 	more...									DISSOLVE TO:49   EXT. JUNGLE PLANET - DAY (MATTE SHOT)	The vast and dense jungle...									DISSOLVE TO:50   EXT. JUNGLE #13 THROUGH #19 - DAY	A series of dissolving shots as Worf and Dax trudge 	through the jungle:	JUNGLE #13 -- Worf hacking away with fury at the	foliage.	JUNGLE #14 -- Dax soldiering on.	JUNGLE #15 -- Worf changing the dressing on her wound.	JUNGLE #16 -- Worf's boots stomping through the jungle.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FOUR    45.50   CONTINUED:	JUNGLE #16 -- Dax's boots staggering behind him.	JUNGLE #17 -- Worf tries to help her through a thick	patch of bushes, but she pulls away from him and	barrels through on her own.	JUNGLE #18 -- Dax getting another injection of plasma.	JUNGLE #19 -- Worf checking the PADD and shaking his	head, unhappy at their progress.									DISSOLVE TO:51   EXT. JUNGLE #20 - DAY	Dax leaning against a tree, eyes closed, and holding 	her rifle like a cane, while Worf checks their position 	again. He turns to Dax.					WORF 			Ready?	Dax nods. She pushes away from the tree, opens her 	eyes and sets off grimly into the jungle. Worf looks 	at the tree...52   WORF'S POV	There's a bright smear of BLOOD on the tree trunk.53   RESUME WORF	As he reacts with concern, then follows Dax.									DISSOLVE TO:54   EXT. JUNGLE #21 - DAY	Worf leading the way, Dax following. Worf is now 	carrying her rifle, but she's still pushing herself 	past the breaking point -- her eyes are watery and 	bloodshot, her face is ashen and covered with sweat 	and she can barely keep putting one foot in front of 	the other. They reach an OBSTACLE (a boulder or 	fallen tree perhaps) and there's no obvious way around. Worf 	climbs awkwardly over the top and then pulls Dax up and 	over, getting scratched and bruised in the process.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FOUR    46.54   CONTINUED:	Worf eases her down on the opposite side and then 	easily jumps down himself. Dax stays on the ground, 	her breathing shallow, on the very edge of passing out 	altogether. Worf kneels down in concern.					WORF			Jadzia... ?					DAX			Hhhh... hhhh... hypo.	He pulls the hypo out of the pack and applies it to her 	neck. Her eyes widen and she takes a big gulp of air. 	Worf opens her jacket and inspects the bandage.					DAX 			There we go... good as new.					WORF 			I have to change the dressing.	He opens the pack, pulls out the medkit and begins to 	change the dressing.					DAX 			That's four bandages in two 			hours... that has to be some kind 			of... record.	She starts laughing -- a little too loud and a little 	too shrill. Dax is one step away from delirium at this 	point.					DAX				(rambling) 			Sorry. I forgot the new rules -- 			nothing funny... we have to be 			serious... life and death... we've 			got a job to do.	Worf finishes the new dressing and regards her for a 	moment. He's very, very concerned about her, but he's 	caught between a rock and a hard place.					WORF 			Jadzia. I know you're tired. But 			we need to cover at least three 			more kilometers before nightfall. 			Can you do it?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Change of Heart" - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FOUR    47.54   CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX 			As long as you have those 			painkillers, I'll follow you 			through the gates of hell... sir.	His expression softens just a little.					DAX 			Hey... that was almost a smile.					WORF 			When this mission is over... I'll 			smile all you want.					DAX			Promise?					WORF			Promise.					DAX 			Then let's finish the mission and 			get out of here.	He lifts her to her feet and she stands there a moment 	on her own. Worf turns to pick up his rifle and Dax 	collapses -- he whirls around just in time to catch her 	before she hits the ground.					DAX 			I can stand... just help me... get 			my balance...	He tries to steady her on her feet... but this time her 	legs can't hold her weight for even a few seconds.
