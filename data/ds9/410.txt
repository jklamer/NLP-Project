We're struck 	by their appearance - eyes and faces embellished with markings 	resembling hieroglyphs.  Their costumes are simple and will 	later be enhanced by various overgarments and accessories.	Their leader, FALOW, steps forward giving Sisko an appraising 	stare.  Forming a triangle with his hands, Falow touches his 	forehead - obviously a Wadi form of greeting.					FALOW			I am Falow, Master Surchid of the 			Wadi.					SISKO			Welcome in the name of Bajor and the 			United Federation of Planets.

Highly sought in our 			culture.  They have many different 			uses.					QUARK			Ah.  I'm sorry.

What is it?					FALOW				(smiles)			Alpha-currant nectar.

Or... or take 			another spin on the house... or two... 			or three... a free visit to a 			holosuite... do you know what a 			holosuite is... do you have sex on 			your world?        DEEP SPACE: "Move Along Home" REV. 12/07/92 - ACT ONE       14.21   CONTINUED:	His words are greeted with a heavy silence.

When it clears the dabo table has been replaced by a 	strange alien game board... there's a central start point 	from which a winding maze serpentines downward toward the 	end triangle.  There are twelve shaps (levels).  Within the 	board, there are short cuts between shaps, allowing players 	to move more rapidly to the end.  Falow begins to put a 	variety of strange symbolic pieces (think hotels in Monopoly) 	at various intervals, elaborately "setting up" the board... 	there is also an electronic component to the board with 	switches and blinkies...23   ANGLE ON QUARK	reacting to the game.					QUARK			Very unusual.
