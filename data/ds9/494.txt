SISKO'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM	SISKO and KASIDY YATES are in bed. Sisko is sound 	asleep, but Kasidy is awake. She looks at his sleeping 	form with obvious affection for a moment, then gently 	kisses him and begins to get out of bed. This wakes 	Sisko and he reaches out a hand to keep her in bed.					SISKO 				(sleepy)			Kasidy? Where're you going?					KASIDY				(whispers)			Down to my ship. I have a meeting 			with my engineer. Go back to 			sleep.	Sisko keeps his eyes closed, but pulls her close, not 	quite willing to give up the comfort and warmth of her 	next to him.					SISKO			You're the captain. He'll wait.					KASIDY				(mocking)			Oh... is that how you treat your 			staff... just make them wait 			around while you sleep in?	Sisko pulls her closer... nuzzles her neck.					SISKO			That's right. In fact, there are 			days I never get out of bed...	Kasidy reacts... it's a sensuous, tempting moment and 	he gives her a long, deep kiss.					KASIDY			You're not making this easy...					SISKO			That's the general idea...	She finally pulls away from him and gets out of bed and 	crosses out of frame.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED:	We stay on Sisko as Kasidy dresses o.s. He smiles a 	sleepy, playful smile at her.					KASIDY			You... are evil...					SISKO 			I'm a Starfleet officer... a 			paragon of virtue.					KASIDY'S VOICE			The next time you're called to Ops 			in the middle of the night... 			you're going to pay for this.					SISKO 			I can't wait.	She comes back into frame, tucking in her shirt as she 	leans down to him.					KASIDY			See you later.					SISKO 			Bye.	She gives him a good-bye kiss and then EXITS. Sisko 	smiles after her for a moment, rolls over and is about 	to go to sleep, when a thought hits him. He picks up 	her pillow, smells it and then tosses his aside and 	puts her pillow under his head. As he drifts back into 	slumber...									CUT TO:2    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing the station.3    INT. WARDROOM	A staff meeting is just getting underway. COMMANDER 	EDDINGTON is briefing Sisko, ODO, DAX, KIRA and WORF, 	who are sitting down around the table.					EDDINGTON			Good morning. This briefing will 			contain information considered 			extremely sensitive by Starfleet 			Command.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - TEASER         3.3    CONTINUED:					EDDINGTON (Cont'd)			Please do not share it with anyone 			who doesn't have a level seven 			security rating.				(beat)			It seems that during their recent 			invasion of Cardassia, the 			Klingons inflicted far more damage 			than we've been led to believe. 			Two weeks ago, the civilian 			government on Cardassia Prime 			secretly contacted the Federation 			Council and made an urgent request 			for industrial replicators. And 			that request... has been granted.	There are surprised reactions around the room.					DAX			How many replicators are we 			talking about?					EDDINGTON			Twelve -- all class four.					KIRA			The Federation's only given Bajor 			two CFI replicators.					EDDINGTON			With all due respect, Bajor is 			just one planet. The Klingons 			have destroyed the industrial base 			of literally dozens of Cardassian 			worlds. With twelve CFI 			replicators, they can at least 			start building new power plants 			and factories.					DAX			Why all the secrecy?					EDDINGTON			Starfleet Intelligence believes 			the Maquis may try to stop the 			shipment or even seize the 			replicators for themselves.					SISKO 			Makes sense. The Cardassian 			military has been so busy fending 			off the Klingons, they've 			basically given the Maquis a free 			hand in the Demilitarized Zone.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - TEASER        3A.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO (Cont'd)			The last thing the Maquis are 			going to want to see is a shipment			of replicators on its way to			Cardassia.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 TEASER          4.3    CONTINUED:	(3)	Eddington nods and then indicates the MAP on the wall	monitor which clearly shows: the Cardassian border, 	the DMZ, the Badlands and DS9.					EDDINGTON				(continuing, indicating				map)			Yes, Sir. Intelligence also			reports that the Demilitarized			Zone between Cardassia and the			Federation has been a hotbed of			increasing terrorist activity for			the past month. We suspect the			Maquis have built several new			bases in the Badlands, and the			Cardassians in the DMZ are getting			worried.					WORF			They should be. Without the 			Cardassian military to stop them, 			the Maquis have a perfect 			opportunity to drive the 			Cardassians out of the DMZ 			permanently.					SISKO			I take it this shipment is going 			to pass through Deep Space Nine?					EDDINGTON			Yes, sir. In three days.					SISKO			All right.				(to Odo)			Let's tighten security on the 			station. Step up random checks of 			incoming and outgoing cargo for 			weapons or explosives, more 			deputies on the Promenade... 			you know the drill.					ODO			Understood.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - TEASER         5.3    CONTINUED:	(4)					SISKO				(to Worf)			Mister Worf, tomorrow I want you 			to take the Defiant and patrol the 			Badlands. Show the flag -- let 			the Maquis know we're ready for 			any trouble.					WORF			Aye, sir.					SISKO				(to Eddington)			I want daily briefings on this 			until the replicators are in 			Cardassian hands.				(to all)			Dismissed.	Eddington and Odo exchange an uncomfortable look.					ODO			The commander and I would like to 			have a word with you...	Sisko nods and waits until everyone else has left the 	room. Sisko picks up on the discomfort of Eddington 	and Odo.					SISKO			Something wrong?					EDDINGTON			Captain... it's come to our 			attention that there may be a 			Maquis smuggler here on the 			station.					SISKO			Oh?					ODO			It's just a theory at this 			point... and frankly our 			suspicions are based on purely... 			circumstantial evidence.					SISKO			Who is it?					EDDINGTON			Again, we're still not certain...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - TEASER         6.3    CONTINUED:	(5)					SISKO			I understand that. Who?	They still hesitate, and Sisko frowns.					SISKO				(continuing)			Gentlemen?					ODO				(reluctant)			Kasidy Yates.	Off Sisko's shocked expression...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT ONE        7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)4    INT. WARDROOM	Continuous from the Teaser. Sisko is looking at Odo 	and Eddington in shock.					SISKO 			Kasidy... ? Working for the 			Maquis? That's impossible.					ODO			I certainly hope so. Smuggling 			with intent to supply a terrorist 			organization is a serious offense.					SISKO				(sharp)			Where's your evidence?	Odo notes the tone of Sisko's voice, but is unruffled 	by it.					ODO			Five months ago, Captain Yates was 			hired by the Bajorans to carry 			cargo to their outlying colonies. 			one of her regular runs is between 			Bajor and the colony on Dreon 			Seven. It's a twelve-hour run for 			most ships, but she always takes 			eighteen.				(beat)			The six hour difference is just 			enough time to allow her to make 			a side trip into the Badlands, 			rendezvous with a Maquis ship and 			then continue on to the Dreon 			System.					SISKO 			That's your evidence? She's 			slow on one of her deliveries?					EDDINGTON			There's more. Starfleet 			Intelligence has infiltrated one 			of the Maquis cells and obtained 			a partial list of their contacts 			in the Bajoran Sector.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT ONE          4    CONTINUED:					EDDINGTON (Cont'd)			They all had cover names, of 			course, but one of their contacts 			started living aboard Deep Space 			Nine in the last six months.					ODO			And Captain Yates has been living 			aboard the station just under six 			months.					SISKO 				(heated)			That's damned slim evidence to 			base an accusation on.					ODO				(calm)			We haven't made accusations... I 			said we have suspicions.	Sisko pulls back a little in the face of Odo's complete 	equanimity.					SISKO 			Right. You did say that.					ODO			Captain... I realize this is an 			awkward situation for you. But if 			I could step up my surveillance of 			Captain Yates...					SISKO 			You've had her under surveillance?					EDDINGTON			We've made... discreet 			observations of her movements on 			the station.					ODO			But we'd like permission to 			conduct a more thorough 			investigation.					SISKO 			You mean install surveillance 			equipment in her quarters...					ODO			If we don't find anything, you can 			be assured she'll never know she 			was under investigation.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT ONE        9.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 			She's a Federation citizen, Odo. 			You can't just invade her privacy 			based on your suspicions... you'd 			need to show me some real evidence 			before I'd authorize what you're 			proposing.					EDDINGTON			If she's really a Maquis, then 			she's no longer a Federation 			citizen.					SISKO 			The answer is no.					EDDINGTON			Understood, sir.	Eddington gives Odo a look -- best not to push Sisko on 	this. They turn to go, but then Sisko's conscience 	gets to him.					SISKO 			Gentlemen...				(they stop)			Putting equipment in her quarters is 			one thing... but her ship is a 			different story. There are times 			when we have to search vessels 			docked at the station. If you can 			find a reason...	Sisko trails off, and they take the hint.					ODO 			We'll let you know.	That said, Odo and Eddington EXIT, leaving a very 	troubled Sisko in the Wardroom.									CUT TO:5    CLOSE ON A PLAYER'S GLOVE	As the glove SMACKS a springball directly at the 	camera.									REVEAL:        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT ONE       9A.6    INT. SPRINGBALL COURT (OPTICAL)	The Court is a redress of the Cargo Bay. The far wall 	has markings to indicate goals and foul lines, while 	the two side walls are blank. The back of the court 	has benches set up and a CROWD is watching the match 	from behind a forcefield, which forms the back wall of 	the court.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT ONE       10.6    CONTINUED:	The game is played by two people at a time and is a 	sort of full contact handball. The players try to hit 	the ball inside a clearly marked oval on the far wall 	without hitting the foul zones. The players can "body 	check" each other to screw up a shot or to steal a shot 	of their own, but there's no punching or kicking 	allowed. A player can also grab the ball out of the 	air with an ungloved hand, but then has to stand in 	place and throw the ball off the wall to set up a 	"shot" with the glove (only a hit with the glove can 	score).	At the moment, the game is being played by Kira and a 	muscular MALE BAJORAN. Kira body checks the Man into 	the side wall, then spins and smacks the ball toward 	the oval... it SCORES and a BUZZER SOUNDS.7    THE CROWD	Watching the game CHEERS and BOOS. In the crowd, we 	see two familiar faces: BASHIR and GARAK, sitting in 	one of the back rows. Bashir is into the game, 	following the players closely, shadow-playing the 	action with slight body movement, occasionally shouting 	encouragement to Kira. Garak is taking a more bemused 	detachment to the affair. Bashir jumps to his feet 	along with some other spectators as Kira scores.					BASHIR			Yeah, Nerys! There you go!	Bashir sits back down as Kira and her opponent reset 	themselves for another serve by the man.					BASHIR 				(to Garak)			Did you see that? The way she gave 			him the tiniest head fake and 			then -- BOOM. Checked him into 			the wall...					GARAK			Yes, it was quite effective.	On the court, Kira serves and the ball goes into play. 	Bashir watches the action closely, while Garak looks 	over the crowd for a moment, finally glancing down 	toward the front row.8    GARAK'S POV	He's watching ZIYAL, who's sitting down in front, 	watching Kira with a smile.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 ACT ONE        11.9    RESUME GARAK & BASHIR					BASHIR 				(to Garak)			Stop watching her.					GARAK			I thought the whole point was to 			watch.					BASHIR 			The point is to watch the game, 			not the spectators. 				(re: Ziyal)			Especially not that spectator.					GARAK			What does she expect? She's the 			only Cardassian woman on this 			station. She must know she's 			going to attract some attention.					BASHIR 			Some, yes. Yours, no.	Kira gets TRIPPED and goes down.					BASHIR 				(shouts)			That's a foul! Come on!	But Kira rolls up quickly and is able to keep the man 	from scoring by grabbing the ball out of the air with 	her free hand.					BASHIR 				(quickly)			Yeah-yeah-yeah!	Garak glances down at Ziyal again.					GARAK 			Maybe I should say hello after the 			game.					BASHIR 				(to Garak)			She's Gul Dukat's daughter, Garak. 			I can't think of anyone in the 			galaxy who hates you more than he 			does. And Ziyal is a friend of 			Kira. I wouldn't play around with 			her if I were you.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT ONE       12.9    CONTINUED:					GARAK				(insulted)			I simply thought it would be 			polite to say hello. But clearly, 			you think I'm incapable of 			conducting any kind of pleasant 			discourse without some nefarious 			ulterior motive...	Bashir rolls his eyes, then turns to him, tries to 	backtrack.					BASHIR 			That's not what I meant. I just 			think you should leave well enough 			alone. Why stir up --	Garak suddenly leaps to his feet along with the rest of 	the crowd just as the BUZZER SOUNDS.					GARAK 			Yes! What a play! Bravo, Major!	Bashir jumps up as well and looks down at the court. 	The man is lying flat on his back and the ball is 	bouncing around the court. Kira has won the game. The 	crowd goes wild, and Bashir missed it.					BASHIR 			What happened?					GARAK				(applauding)			A brilliant move on the part of 			the major. You should've been 			paying attention.	Bashir reacts as the crowd continues to yell and 	applaud. Kira acknowledges the cheers and helps her 	opponent to his feet.	Garak glances down at Ziyal one more time... and turns 	away again as soon as she turns to look at him.									CUT TO:10   EXT.

SISKO'S QUARTERS	Sisko is COOKING some kind of emerald-green stew on the 	stove while another pot of boiling water with pasta 	sits nearby. He tastes the stew, frowns, adds some 	spices as the door CHIMES.					SISKO 			Come in.	The doors OPEN and Kasidy ENTERS.					KASIDY			Did you know you can smell that 			all the way down the corridor?	Sisko tries to act like nothing's wrong. Throughout 	the scene, he's trying to be "normal," trying not to 	let her know anything's wrong. But this kind of 	deception is not Sisko's strong suit, he doesn't like 	it and there is a slight false note to his cheeriness.					SISKO				(without turning around)			It's an experiment. Bajoran 			ratamba stew over spinach 			linguine.	She moves to him, puts her arms around him. He tries 	not to stiffen.					KASIDY				(continuing)			Don't your neighbors ever 			complain?					SISKO			Sometimes. But it's usually just 			an excuse to get a taste of what 			I'm cooking.					KASIDY			How sneaky of them.					SISKO			Yeah... they're a duplicitous 			bunch.	She gives him a kiss on the neck just as Jake ENTERS 	from his room, carrying a PADD.					JAKE			All right you two, break it up. 			I have a problem. Do either of 			you know what a Kavarian tiger-bat 			smells like?	They both turn and look at him.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT ONE       14.11   CONTINUED:					JAKE				(continuing)			It's for a story I'm working on. 			The computer database has plenty 			of pictures, but no olfactory 			information.					SISKO			You're a writer. Make something 			up. 					JAKE			I'm going for a real "you are 			there" feeling. The details have 			to be right. Kas, haven't you 			been to Kavaria?	Sisko moves to a box and removes a complete alien 	plant. The roots still have a sizable amount of dirt 	clinging to them. Throughout the following 	conversation, Sisko begins to carefully brush the dirt 	from the roots onto a cutting board.					KASIDY			Not me. Sorry.	Sisko thinks about this for a moment, suddenly sees an 	opportunity to probe Kasidy for some answers.					SISKO				(to Kasidy, casual)			Don't you make a regular cargo run 			to a neighboring system?					KASIDY			No, Kavaria's out toward the 			Badlands. I try to stay away from 			there.				(to Jake)			You should ask Quark.

She may look 	youthful and innocent, but there's an inner steel to 	this young woman, a edge that was honed in that Breen 	POW camp for the formative years of her life.					ZIYAL			You really think I asked you here 			to kill you? Well, it did occur 			to me.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT FIVE       57.47   CONTINUED:	(2)					ZIYAL				(Cont'd)			Kira and my father both told me 			that you used to be an agent of 			the Obsidian Order... that you had 			my grandfather tortured and 			killed... and that you could 			easily kill me without a second			thought.					GARAK			Although I seldom credit either 			the major or your father with 			being entirely trustworthy... in 			this case, they're both telling 			the truth.	Ziyal doesn't flinch.					ZIYAL			You know what else is true? I 			don't care. I'm half-Bajoran and 			that means I'm an outcast back 			home. I can't go back and neither 			can you. So we can either share 			some time together or we can 			ignore each other. I spent five 			years in a prisoner of war camp by			myself, I don't need your company. 				(beat)			But if you want to stay and share 			the heat with me... maybe tell me 			something about home that I don't 			know... then I would welcome your 			company. And I get the feeling 			you'd welcome mine. Either way, 			it's up to you.	With that, Ziyal lies back down on the rock. Garak 	looks at her for a beat, then takes a PHASER out of his	pocket. Ziyal watches him calmly, waiting to see what	he's going to do.					GARAK 			Well, I suppose I won't be needing 			this anymore...	He casually tosses the phaser aside and begins to lie 	down on his rock.					GARAK			So... what shall we talk about 			first?	As a small smile begins to form on Ziyal's lips...									CUT TO:       DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT FIVE       58.48   EXT. SPACE - THE XHOSA (OPTICAL)	The Xhosa is docking at the station.49   INT. CARGO BAY/AIRLOCK	Sisko is standing alone in the empty cargo bay as the	airlock door OPENS and Kasidy ENTERS. The two of them 	look at each other for a long moment, a deep gulf 	between them for the first time.					SISKO			Just you?					KASIDY			I dropped my crew off at a Maquis 			base. I had to come back... but 			I didn't see any reason to drag 			them here just to face a prison 			sentence.					SISKO			You didn't have to come back 			either.					KASIDY			Yes, I did. And I think we both 			know that's why you left us alone 			out there... to see if I would. 				(beat)			I'm not going to stand here and			apologize for what I did. You had 			your duty, I had mine.					SISKO			I still have my duty.					KASIDY			I know. And I know I'm probably 			going to prison... but I came back 			because of us... because despite 			all that's happened... I still 			love you, Ben. I don't want to 			throw that away. 				(beat)			Do you?	Sisko looks at her for a long moment... he moves closer 	to her, looks into those eyes he loves so much and 	finally tells her what she wants to hear.					SISKO			No.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "For The Cause" - 03/07/96 - ACT FIVE       59.49   CONTINUED:	They reach out for each other... tentatively at 	first... then with the force and passion of two people 	about to be separated for a long time. They hold each 	other tight, and then Sisko forces himself to let go 	and takes a step back. They look into each other's 	eyes, their hearts breaking... and Sisko finally hits 	his combadge.					SISKO				(to com)			Lieutenant Reese...	There's a beat and then the doors to the Cargo Bay OPEN	and Lieutenant Reese and two N.D. Guards ENTER and 	stand just inside the doors. Kasidy looks at them, 	knows it's time to go.					KASIDY			I'll be back.					SISKO			I'll be here.	Sisko nods to Reese and then Kasidy and the Security 	Guards EXIT, leaving Sisko alone in the vast, empty 	room...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
