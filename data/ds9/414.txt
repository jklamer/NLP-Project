SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.					SISKO (V.O.)			Station log, Stardate 46729.1.  The 			Bajoran government has asked me to 			mediate a dispute between two rival 			factions, the Paqu and the Navot.  			At issue is a land dispute which 			could trigger a civil war.2    INT. OPS	SISKO EXITS his office.  KIRA, DAX and O'BRIEN are at their 	stations; Supernumeraries as needed.					KIRA			Commander, the Paqu delegation has 			arrived at docking bay six.					SISKO			Let's welcome them aboard.  Dax, any 			word on the Navot?					DAX			They should be here within the hour.	Sisko and Kira head for the Turbolift.          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - TEASER           2.2    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Excuse me, Commander.3    NEW ANGLE	as O'Brien comes down from Engineering to join Sisko and 	Kira at the Turbolift.					SISKO			Chief, I thought you'd be on your 			way to Bajor by now.					O'BRIEN			We're due to leave any moment.				(ill at ease)			Sir, I was wondering if perhaps Ensign 			Boyer could take my place on this 			particular mission.  After all, I'd 			be little more than a chauffeur, and 			Boyer can pilot a Runabout as well 			as I can.					SISKO			Has something come up that requires 			your presence on the station?					O'BRIEN			No, Sir.  Everything's running 			smoothly, for a change.  But around 			here, you never know...	Just then BASHIR ENTERS from the Ops doorway.					BASHIR			Ah, there you are Chief.  All set to 			go?					O'BRIEN			Yes, Sir.	Sisko and O'Brien exchange a look.  Sisko now understands 	the reason behind O'Brien's reluctance.  Bashir doesn't pick 	up on any of this.        DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - REV. 2/05/93 - TEASER        3.3    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Commander, did the Magistrate give 			any indication regarding the nature 			of this medical emergency?					SISKO				(shaking his head)			Only that his village was in danger 			of extinction.					BASHIR			In that case we better be on our 			way.	Sisko and Kira enter the Turbolift.					SISKO				(to O'Brien)			I agree.					O'BRIEN			Yes, Sir.					SISKO				(to comm)			Docking port six.	The Turbolift begins its descent.  O'Brien and Bashir head 	for the door.					BASHIR			You know Chief, in a way I'm really 			looking forward to this mission.					O'BRIEN			Why's that?					BASHIR			I see it as a wonderful opportunity 			for us to get to know one another.	As they EXIT out the door, O'Brien glances back at Sisko.  	He's not a happy camper.4    INT. TURBOLIFT	On Sisko and Kira.          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - TEASER           4.4    CONTINUED:					SISKO				(to Kira)			I'd like you to set up a preliminary 			meeting with both sides for later 			this afternoon.  Make sure they know 			that this is an informal session.  I 			just want to get them talking to 			each other.					KIRA			Just getting them to sit down at the 			same table will be an accomplishment.				(beat)			Sir, about these negotiations...					SISKO			You have some advice for me?					KIRA			There's an old saying on Bajor, "the 			land and the people are one." Well, 			the land inhabited by the Paqu and 			Navot is some of the harshest on the 			planet.					SISKO			Relax Major.  This isn't my first 			time up at the plate.					KIRA				(doesn't get the 				baseball reference)			Sir...	As the Turbolift doors open...					SISKO				(smiling)			Besides, I'll have you by my side to 			help me avoid making mistakes.	And they EXIT.5    INT. DOCKING PORT SEVEN - CORRIDOR	Moving with Sisko and Kira as they reach the airlock door.					SISKO			What can you tell me about the Paqu 			Tetrarch?          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - TEASER           5.5    CONTINUED:					KIRA			Not much.  The Paqu choose to avoid 			contact with outsiders.	The airlock doors OPEN and out steps a Paqu advisor.  He 	steps aside to allow another figure to emerge from the 	passage: a hard-bitten fifteen-year-old girl (VARIS SUL).					VARIS			Commander Sisko?	Sisko nods, somewhat confused.					SISKO			Yes?					VARIS			I am Varis Sul, Tetrarch of the Paqu.	As Sisko and Kira react we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - REV. 2/11/93 - ACT ONE        6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(Note: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)6    EXT. SPACE - RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)	Traveling at impulse.7    INT. RUNABOUT	O'Brien in the pilot seat.  Bashir, feeling ignored, is seated 	behind him.  Hold for a beat a silence.  Then...					BASHIR				(a beat)			Chief, may I ask you a question?					O'BRIEN				(all business)			Of course.					BASHIR			And I'd like an honest answer.					O'BRIEN			You'll get one.	Bashir hesitates a moment before speaking.					BASHIR			Do I... annoy you?					O'BRIEN				(looking over his 				shoulder)			Annoy me?  What kind of question is 			that?					BASHIR			Well, the thing is, we've just spent 			two hours alone together in this 			runabout and you hardly said a word 			to me the whole time.	O'Brien turns back to the controls.					O'BRIEN			Really?  I hadn't noticed.					BASHIR			Oh, I see...       DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - REV. 2/11/93 - ACT ONE       6A.7    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			I suppose I was too busy... thinking.					BASHIR			Thinking?					O'BRIEN			That's right.	A beat as Bashir mulls over O'Brien's answer.  Then...					BASHIR			About what?					O'BRIEN			What?					BASHIR			What were you thinking about?  I'm 			just curious.	O'Brien does a slow burn but he refuses to allow the young 	doctor to see how annoyed he's getting.					O'BRIEN			Let's see... I was thinking that 			when I get back to the station, I'll 			have to run a level one diagnostic 			on the phase coil generators.				(a beat)			Satisfied?					BASHIR				(nods)			I guess so.					O'BRIEN				(case closed)			Glad to hear it.          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - ACT ONE          7.7    CONTINUED:	(2)	But Bashir isn't willing to let it go just yet.  He's 	determined to empty his pockets.					BASHIR			I mean, the only reason I brought it 			up is because your opinion means a 			lot to me, and I'm aware I have a 			tendency to run off at the mouth 			sometimes.					O'BRIEN			Is that a fact.					BASHIR			I suppose it's a nervous habit.  I 			hope you don't hold it against me.					O'BRIEN			Not at all, Sir.	Bashir nods to himself.  This has gone better than he thought, 	though he still suspects O'Brien isn't being totally up front 	with him.  He decides to take it one more step.					BASHIR			Oh, and one more thing.					O'BRIEN			And what would that be, Sir?	O'Brien steadies himself.  He figures next he'll have to 	listen to stories from Bashir's childhood.					BASHIR			I don't think it's really necessary 			for you to call me "Sir."					O'BRIEN				(surprised)			What should I call you?  You're my 			superior officer.					BASHIR			How about Julian.	O'Brien flinches, but quickly recovers his laconic poise.					O'BRIEN			Is that an order?       DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - REV. 2/04/93 - ACT ONE        8.7    CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR			Of course not.  I'd simply prefer it 			if you called me by my first name.	O'Brien considers a beat then...					O'BRIEN				(checking console)			All right.  We've achieved stable orbit 			around Bajor.  We can beam down any 			time... Julian.	And we notice just the slightest edge in his voice as he 	says the name.  Bashir notices it as well.  Hopes he's 	mistaken.8    EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY (OPTICAL)	Bashir and O'Brien MATERIALIZE in the middle of a plaza.  A 	few villagers are cleaning up some debris.  Nearby is a large 	raised platform.  Bashir takes out his medical tricorder.  	Takes readings.					BASHIR				(re: tricorder)			No sign of any airborne infections, 			the soil appears free of pollutants, 			and the ground water's clear of 			bacterial contamination.					FAREN (O.S.)			Gentlemen...9    NEW ANGLE	to include FAREN, a Bajoran official.          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - ACT ONE          9.9    CONTINUED:					FAREN			I am Faren Kag, the village 			magistrate.					BASHIR			I'm Doctor Bashir and this is Chief 			O'Brien.					FAREN			This village is in great jeopardy.  			I only hope you're not too late.	He leads them toward a large stone building.9A   INT. SIRAH'S CHAMBER	Faren leads Bashir and O'Brien into the room where an old 	man (THE SIRAH) lies asleep in a bed.  (NOTE: The Sirah wears 	a bracelet, set with a green stone, around one of his wrists.) 	HOVATH, a young Bajoran of twenty-four, sits watching over 	him.					FAREN			Has he shown any sign of improvement?					HOVATH			None.					FAREN				(to Bashir)			You must help him.					BASHIR			How many others are sick?					FAREN			Others?					O'BRIEN			You said the entire village was in 			jeopardy?					FAREN			It is.				(looking down at the 				old man)			If he dies, we all die.	Off O'Brien and Bashir's reactions...          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - ACT ONE         9A.10   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)11   INT. QUARK'S - A BACK ROOM	Sisko, Kira, Varis, and WOBAN, the large, gruff Navot leader, 	are seated at a table.  Woban munches on some hors d'oeuvres.					WOBAN			I'll say this for the Cardassians.  			Their replicators make a fine larish 			pie.					VARIS				(to Sisko)			I didn't come here to eat, Commander.					SISKO			Then let's talk.  The official 			negotiations won't begin until 			tonight, but I thought it might be a 			good idea for us to meet informally 			to see where we all stand.	Sisko consults his PADD.          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - ACT ONE         10.11   CONTINUED:					SISKO			According to the treaty that has 			existed between you for the past 			ninety years...				(reading)			"... the border separating the Paqu 			and the Navot shall forever be the 			river Glyrhond."					WOBAN			That's correct.	Varis nods curtly.					KIRA				(an attempt at levity)			Well, at least we all agree on 			something.					SISKO			Now, as I understand it, during the 			occupation the Cardassians diverted 			the river for use in their mining 			operations.  As a result the Glyrhond 			now flows twenty kilometers west of 			its former position.					WOBAN			Twenty kilometers into Navot 			territory.					VARIS			It's Paqu territory now.				(to Sisko)			You read the treaty Commander.  The 			river is our common border.					WOBAN			The treaty says nothing about stealing 			land.  If your father was alive he'd 			give us back what was ours.					VARIS			My father would have done no such 			thing.  Besides, I'm Tetrarch now.				(coldly)			I will not be pressured into betraying 			my people.          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - ACT ONE         11.11   CONTINUED:	(2)	Before Sisko can respond, the tension is cut by the arrival 	of an upbeat QUARK, who carries a tray of drinks which he 	distributes around the table.					QUARK			Let's see, one glass of Gamzian wine, 			two Bajoran synthales...				(to Varis)			And a Trixian bubble juice for the 			little lady.	Varis grabs the glass and, rising, splashes the contents in 	Quark's face.					VARIS			I'm not a little lady.	She storms away.  Quark wipes his face then turns to Sisko.					QUARK			I'm still charging her for that drink.	But Sisko and Kira have other concerns.12   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	JAKE and NOG are seated at their usual spot.  Jake is wearing 	a baseball glove.					JAKE			Nog, we've been sitting here over an 			hour.  Let's go play some ball in 			the Holosuite.					NOG			No.					JAKE			Why not?					NOG			Because baseball is slow and boring...					JAKE			And you can't hit my curve ball.					NOG			It's a stupid game that even humans 			stopped playing hundreds of years 			ago.          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - ACT ONE         12.12   CONTINUED:					JAKE			Maybe.  But you still can't hit my 			curve ball.	Before Nog can protest...					ODO (V.O.)			Mister Sisko...13   NEW ANGLE	As ODO advance toward the boys.					ODO			Nog, I thought I told you no dangling 			over the Promenade.					JAKE			We're not gonna fall, Odo.					NOG			We can see things better from down 			here.	Odo peers over the railing.					ODO			And what, may I ask, is so important 			to see?					JAKE			Nothing.					ODO			In that case, you can see "nothing" 			just as well from up here.				(an order)			Now, on your feet.	The boys scramble to a standing position.					ODO			Thank you.          DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - 2/02/93 - ACT ONE         13.	He continues his rounds.  The boys wait until he turns 	the bend, then sit back down.					JAKE			Are you gonna come to the Holosuite 			with me or not?  We can have Buck 			Bokai hit a few out to us.  He was 			the greatest hitter of all time.				(a beat)			I'll even let you use my glove.					NOG				(a moonstruck grin)			I've never seen anything so beautiful.	Jake stares at the glove.  Maybe he's missing something.  	But Nog isn't talking about some worn piece of leather.  He 	points below to the Promenade.14   THEIR POV	Varis and her advisor are passing beneath them.15   BACK TO SCENE	Both boys check her out carefully.					JAKE				(nothing special)			She's all right.					NOG			All right?				(determined)			I have to meet her.	Jake stares at his lovesick buddy.  Yeah, Nog's serious.16   EXT. SPACE - THE PLANET BAJOR (OPTICAL)17   INT. SIRAH'S CHAMBER	Bashir is finishing up his examination of the Sirah, who 	remains asleep.  O'Brien is seated in a chair on the other 	side of the room.  Hovath looks to the doctor for reassurance.  	But Bashir has none to give.  Whatever he's picked up on the 	medical tricorder isn't good.  Suddenly the Sirah begins to 	stir.       DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - REV. 2/04/93 - ACT ONE       14.17   CONTINUED:					SIRAH			The Dal'Rok...	He attempts to sit up.  Bashir lays a restraining hand on 	him.					BASHIR			Easy now.  Try not to exert yourself.	The Sirah looks around.  Spots Hovath.					SIRAH			Hovath, the time... ?					HOVATH			Still two hours before nightfall.					SIRAH			You should have woken me.  Help me 			get dressed.	Hovath moves to the bed but Bashir motions him away.					BASHIR			I'm afraid you're in no shape to go 			anywhere.	The Sirah sizes up Bashir.					SIRAH			The prophets sent you, didn't they.					BASHIR			I beg your pardon?	The Sirah smiles, takes hold of Bashir's hand.  The smile 	fades.					SIRAH				(troubled)			No... Something's wrong.  It must be 			your companion.	O'Brien, who has been seated in the b.g. listening with only 	half an ear, suddenly begins to pay closer attention to the 	conversation.					BASHIR				(baffled)			You mean Chief O'Brien?					SIRAH			Bring him to me.       DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - REV. 2/04/93 - ACT ONE       15.17   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR			Why?					SIRAH			Because you are not the one I've 			been waiting for.	That doesn't exactly clarify matters, but Bashir turns to 	O'Brien.					BASHIR			Chief... he wants to see you.	O'Brien rises.  The Sirah waves him over.					SIRAH			Come closer.	O'Brien looks to Bashir, who gives a "don't ask me" shrug.  	O'Brien approaches the bed.  The Sirah grabs hold of his 	hand then smiles with satisfaction.					SIRAH				(to O'Brien)			I knew the prophets wouldn't fail 			us.				(a beat)			You may leave now...				(to Bashir)			Both of you.	Bashir is about to argue, then thinks better of it.					BASHIR				(to Hovath)			See that he stays in bed.	As Bashir and O'Brien head for the door.					O'BRIEN			What was that all about?					BASHIR			I haven't a clue.	They EXIT.       DEEP SPACE: "The Storyteller" - REV. 2/04/93 - ACT ONE       16.18   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS	Bashir and O'Brien are met by an anxious Faren.					FAREN			The Sirah... how is he?					BASHIR			I wish I had better news.  He's 			suffering from systemic organ failure 			brought on by an accelerated rate of 			cellular decay... his body is 			surrendering to old age.					FAREN				(hopefully)			Is there anything you can do?					BASHIR			I can keep him comfortable and 			relatively free of pain.
