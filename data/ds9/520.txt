After feeling he 	lost Kira to Shakaar, she's suddenly available again, 	and it's bringing his long-buried feelings to the 	surface.					DAX 			No wonder you've been so down 			lately.					KIRA			I miss him. But last time we were 			on Bajor, we went to the Kenda 			Shrine and asked the Prophets if 			we were meant to walk the same 			path.					DAX			And?					KIRA			We're not.	Dax isn't sure what she thinks of this...					DAX 			You make it sound so... cut and 			dry.					KIRA			The way I see it, people are 			either meant to be together or 			they're not.					DAX			I guess I'd rather believe that 			any relationship can work if both 			people really want it to.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

On her 	MONITOR, we see a schematic of the planet and the 	barrier around it.					KIRA				(off her console) 			It's hard to tell from all the 			interference, but there could be 			lifeforms on the surface.					DAX			If there are, I'd be interested to 			see how they've adapted to the 			quantum fluctuations in the 			barrier.	This is an intriguing possibility, but O'Brien wants to 	get home.					O'BRIEN 			Maybe we can check it out the next 			time we come this way.					DAX			It'll be too late -- at the rate 			the interference is intensifying, 			in another few weeks, we won't 			even be able to send a probe 			through it.	Sisko can see where this is heading...					SISKO			Dax...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

We'll make a quick 			survey.	O'Brien frowns, turns to his console.					SISKO				(to Dax) 			But if all we detect is some 			fungus, we're not beaming down.	As she sets to work...					DAX 				(sly) 			What if it's a smart fungus?	Off Sisko's playful scowl...6    OMITTED       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

I'm reading 			approximately eight thousand 			inhabitants... they appear to be 			human.					SISKO			On screen.11   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	where we see a human woman of about forty and a human	man of about the same age. They're speaking from 	inside a simple structure, made of wooden logs and 	mortar. They're dressed in simple work clothes, 	something a farmer or ranch hand might wear. Their 	faces and demeanor speak to a lifetime spent working 	outdoors.	The man, YEDRIN, smiles at the sight of our people, 	almost as if he recognizes them. He has a few Trill-	like spots on his face. The woman, MIRANDA, speaks 	first. we'll come to discover that she's the elected 	leader of the community.					MIRANDA 			Welcome to Gaia, Captain Sisko.					SISKO			You know my name.					MIRANDA 			We've been expecting you.	Yedrin can see that Sisko isn't sure what to make of 	this...					YEDRIN 			It's a long story, Benjamin. Why 			don't you come down and we'll talk 			about it over some raktajino.				(smiles) 			I forgot. You're trying to cut 			down.	Off Sisko's face as he reacts to the familiarity with 	which this stranger speaks to him...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

Scattered around the main settlement we see 	other, smaller clusters of buildings. Windmills and 	irrigation pipes dot the landscape.13   EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY (OPTICAL)	as Sisko, Dax, Worf, and O'Brien MATERIALIZE. The 	buildings that surround them show a range of 	architectural styles, as if they were built over years 	of technological advances -- a wooden building with a 	thatched roof abuts an adobe-type building, which 	stands next to a brick and tile structure.	As the crew beams in, all activity in the settlement 	stops. Some CHILDREN who were playing with a BALL halt 	their game and stare at our people with a mixture of 	curiosity and awe. The people in the market stop 	inspecting the wares on the CARTS. A man who was DYEING 	FABRIC in a barrel pulls his hands out and wipes them 	on a cloth. A woman who was sifting pebbles from a 	sack of beans with a SIEVE stops what she's doing.	Like Yedrin and Miranda, the inhabitants are dressed in 	practical, worn-looking clothes. These are working 	people, and their physicality expresses this in every 	way. They are a racially mixed group -- Black, 	Caucasian, Asian. A few of the men wear beards, and we 	might notice that a few of the inhabitants have subtle 	Trill markings, while a few others have subtle Klingon-	style forehead ridges.	Yedrin and Miranda approach the crew, who are taking in 	their surroundings. Yedrin holds his hands clasped 	behind his back as he approaches, much the same way 	Jadzia does. As Miranda extends a hand to Sisko, 	Yedrin glances at Jadzia.					MIRANDA			Miranda O'Brien.	O'Brien reacts -- this is an odd coincidence. Yedrin 	introduces himself to Sisko.					YEDRIN			Yedrin...				(looking at Jadzia)			Yedrin Dax.	This is starting to get weird.					DAX				(wry)			What a coincidence...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

Scan me --			you'll find the Dax symbiont right 			here.	He pats his abdomen. Dax glances to Sisko, who nods 	she go ahead.					DAX				(off tricorder)			It's true.					YEDRIN			The symbiont has been passed down 			to Jadzia's descendents for three 			generations.				(smiles) 			I remember all of you like it was 			yesterday.	Sisko looks at Yedrin, struggling to make sense of it 	all.					YEDRIN 			If you scan Miranda, you'll find 			that her DNA is substantially 			similar to the chief's.					DAX				(off tricorder) 			She's an O'Brien, all right.	Miranda hastens to point out --					MIRANDA 			And a Tannenbaum, too.	Miranda, like the rest of the descendents, is not just 	aware of her lineage, she's proud of it.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

MEETING HALL - DAY (OPTICAL)	This is the room we saw on the bridge viewscreen, an 	odd mix of high and low technology. A VIEWSCREEN from 	the ship is built into one side of the room, a 	FIREPLACE into another. As Miranda and Yedrin lead 	Sisko, Dax, O'Brien and Worf inside they see a most 	improbable sight: two young girls are sitting at one of 	the tables near the viewscreen, doing schoolwork on 	pencil and paper. The girls are watching QUARK'S image 	displayed on the viewscreen. He's standing to the left 	side of the screen, in front of a black background.					QUARK				(to the girls) 			Ready for the next problem?					MIRANDA			This is our meeting hall...				(smiling at the girls) 			Which as you can see, we sometimes 			use as a schoolroom.	As Quark speaks, the relevant portions of what he says 	appear in LETTERS on the right side of the screen.					QUARK 			Say you have twenty-seven 			tessipates of land you want to 			plant with nice juicy yelg melons.				(rubbing his tummy) 			Yum.				(continuing) 			If each melon needs one square 			kerripate to grow in, what's the 			total number of melons you can 			plant?				(beat) 			Let me know as soon as you have an 			answer.	And with that, Quark's image DISAPPEARS, leaving only 	the words: TWENTY-SEVEN TESSIPATES, and on the next 	line, ONE MELON PER KERRIPATE.	Sisko and the others turn to Yedrin with curious looks.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

The 	discovery of his ruse means the end of his people, and 	it's all he can think about. Sisko's anger over Dax's 	deceit is barely under control, simmering underneath 	the surface. Jadzia's anger is out front and center.					DAX 			You betrayed us. You betrayed me. 			You call yourself Yedrin Dax,			but you're not anyone I recognize.	Yedrin speaks as if from far away, he's beyond 	questions of friendship and betrayal right now...					YEDRIN 			Now that you know... what are you 			going to do about it?					SISKO				(hard) 			What do you think?	Now it's Yedrin's turn to get angry --					YEDRIN 			Dammit, Ben -- if you don't take 			the Defiant back in time, the 			eight thousand people on this 			planet will cease to exist!					SISKO			Do you think I don't care? Come 			on, you know me better than that. 			But what am I supposed to do -- 			recreate the accident and 			deliberately maroon my crew?					YEDRIN 			It's what would've happened! 			Who's to say it's not what's 			supposed to happen?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

I have 			a duty to protect my people.					YEDRIN 			Look around you, Ben. Think of 			all the things you've seen since 			you got here. This is what your 			crew and their descendents will 			build if you let history play 			itself out. I'm not saying it 			won't be hard at first, but 			they'll have good lives here. 			Happy lives.					DAX			What about Kira? If we don't get 			her back to the station, she'll 			die.					YEDRIN 			Is one life too much to ask if it 			means saving eight thousand?	Sisko explodes --					SISKO 			Who are you to decide who lives 			and who dies? Who are you to make 			that call?					YEDRIN 			I have to make that call! Because 			I'm responsible for what happened 			here!	Yedrin's anguished vehemence stops Sisko in his tracks 	long enough for him to continue.					YEDRIN 			Jadzia knows what I'm talking 			about. She's the one who insisted 			the Defiant investigate this 			planet.				(to Jadzia) 			You know as well as I do that you 			should've been more careful... you 			should've seen that the barrier 			was unstable when you scanned it.	The two Dax's look at each other, both knowing this is 	true. She makes a difficult admission.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children... " - REV. 03/11/97 - ACT THREE     34.29   CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX 			But I didn't. I was so bent on 			making some great discovery that 			I missed it.					YEDRIN				(to Jadzia) 			And because of you, because of me -- 			Kira died, and forty-eight people 			were stranded here. You don't 			know what it was like to live with 			that.				(to Sisko) 			For years, every time I looked at 			you, all I could think of was 			Jake... and how because of me, 			he'd never see his father again. 			But eventually, I had to accept 			the fact that there was nothing I 			could do to change things. I 			couldn't bring Kira back. All I 			could do was look to the future. 			And make sure we survived. No 			matter what.				(with growing resolve) 			This community is my 			responsibility. For two 			centuries, I've watched it grow 			into something to be proud of. 			These people have worked for 			generations to make a life for 			themselves here, and they deserve 			the chance to hang on to it.	Sisko takes in the undeniable power of Yedrin's 	words... but in the final analysis, he's determined to 	protect his crew.					SISKO 			I'm not denying that. I wish 			there was a way we could help 			you... but my people have the 			right to go home to their 			families. And I can't ask Kira to 			sacrifice her life, not for eight 			thousand people, not for eight 			million.

Kira gives him a small smile to let him know she 	has no doubts about what they're doing... he gives her 	a small nod, letting her know he understands.					WORF			We're breaking orbit...					DAX 			Coming around to four two mark 			seven.	INTERACTIVE LIGHT starts to play on our people's 	faces...					O'BRIEN			I'm picking up an unusual temporal 			signature...					KIRA 			It's the anomaly, we're heading 			right for it.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

" - REV. 03/11/97 - ACT FIVE    50A.80   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(off console)			Someone changed our flight plan.	Sisko is so taken off-guard by this he just stares at 	O'Brien.					O'BRIEN			It wasn't me.	Sisko can see that he's telling the truth, and he has 	bigger things on his mind right now than finding out 	who was responsible. He turns to Kira --      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

Everything's... 			gone...	Our people react to this tragic loss. Sisko settles 	heavily into his chair... stares at the planet as it 	slowly recedes from sight on the VIEWSCREEN. 	Off this moment...81   EXT. SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL)	as it travels at warp...82   INT. DEFIANT - CORRIDOR	as Sisko and Dax make their way down it...					SISKO 			Whoever changed our flight plan 			knew their way around the computer 			system. They bypassed the 			security protocols without leaving 			a trace.	Dax can see what Sisko is implying...					DAX			It must've been someone from the crew.					SISKO			Or someone who used to be.					DAX				(catching on) 			Yedrin?	Dax understands Sisko's reasoning, but one thing 	doesn't make sense to her.					DAX			But all he cared about was the 			settlement. What could've changed 			his mind?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

And as long as we 			remember them, they always will...	Sisko smiles, taking a bit of comfort in the sentiment. 	They round the corner and Odo -- our Odo, ENTERS the 	corridor from the other direction. He moves to Kira's 	door, hesitates for a beat...83   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS	where Kira is lying on the lower bunk, lost in thought. 	The door CHIMES.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

She's feeling a bit awkward 	because she feels she knows something he doesn't, and 	she's not sure what to do. Odo, for his part, seems 	very uncomfortable about something as well.					ODO			There's something you should know. 			The other Odo, the one from the 			planet, came to Sickbay before he 			left the ship.					KIRA 			Oh?					ODO			He linked with me.				(awkward) 			Now I know... everything that 			happened.	She looks down, realizing the implications. A silent 	moment between them... Kira takes this in for a 	moment... asks about something she's been thinking 	about...					KIRA			The other day, when I told you 			that Shakaar and I weren't seeing 			each other anymore, you seemed so 			uncomfortable.					ODO			I'd come to accept the fact that 			you were involved with someone 			else, and suddenly... everything 			changed.	Odo can see Kira is still struggling to make sense of	it all...					KIRA			I don't know what to say. I'm 			still trying to sort it all out.					ODO			So am I. I think we both need 			time.	She nods... a quiet moment between them.      DFEP SPACE NINE: "Children...

He			loved you.					KIRA			And that makes it right?					ODO			I don't know.				(beat)			He thought so.	A quiet moment between them...					ODO			I'll see you in the morning.	And with that, Odo EXITS... off Kira's face as she 	considers everything that's happened, and wonders 	what's in store for the two of them...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
