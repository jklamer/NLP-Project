	FADE IN:

1    INT. BASHIR'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM

	CLOSE ON DOCTOR BASHIR, sleeping.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Doctor Bashir. The time is oh-
			five hundred.

	Bashir forces his eyes open.

					BASHIR
			Right.

	After a beat, Bashir closes his eyes again.

	Suddenly --

2    A WOMAN'S HAND

	reaches over from the other side of the bed and
	shakes him softly.


					EZRI'S VOICE
			Julian... we have to get up.

3    BASHIR

	turns over to his other side as we ADJUST to REVEAL
	EZRI DAX, lying next to him. They snuggle for a
	beat.

					BASHIR
			Are you sure?

					EZRI
			It's a big day.

					BASHIR
			It was a big night.
				(a beat)
			It cleared up a lot of questions.

					EZRI
			Such as? 


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER       2.

3    CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
				(touching one of
				Ezri's Trill

				markings)
			How far those spots go down.

					EZRI
				(smiling)
			I suppose you're going to want to
			tell Miles.

					BASHIR
			Why would I do that?

					EZRI
			Because you tell him everything.

					BASHIR
				(thinking it over)
			True... but this time, I'll make
			an exception.

					EZRI
			Good -- now we really should get
			going. We don't want the Defiant
			leaving without us.

	But Bashir makes no move to get out of bed.

					BASHIR
			You know, I've never gone into
			battle with someone I've slept
			with.

					EZRI
			There's a first time for
			everything.

					BASHIR
			Now that we're finally together,
			it'd be a shame if anything
			happened to one of us...

	Ezri offers Bashir her hand to shake.

					EZRI
			Let's make a pact. We both come
			home alive.

	Bashir takes her hand.

					BASHIR
			You've got yourself a deal.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER      2A.

3    CONTINUED:	(2)

					EZRI
			I'm going to hold you to that.

	They lean over and kiss. After a moment, they both
	slip out of bed on opposite sides.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER       3.

4    INT. O'BRIENS' QUARTERS

	O'BRIEN, in his Starfleet uniform, steps out of his
	bedroom pretending not to have a care in the world.
	KEIKO is feeding KIRAYOSHI, while MOLLY is finishing
	her breakfast.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Keiko)
			Now remember, Kirayoshi has his
			checkup tomorrow morning at oh-
			nine hundred.

					KEIKO
				(nodding)
			I've already confirmed the
			appointment with Nurse Bandee.
				(to Kirayoshi)
			One more bite...

					O'BRIEN
			And try to get some rest... don't
			stay up too late writing that
			paper on... whatever those trees
			are called.

					KEIKO
			Arfillian Ficus and they're not
			trees, they're shrubs.

					O'BRIEN
			Right. Anyway, be sure to get
			some sleep, oh yeah, and --

					KEIKO
				(gently)
			Miles -- stop worrying. We're
			going to be fine.

					O'BRIEN
			I know.

	O'Brien leans over and kisses her. Just then
	something off-screen catches his eye --


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER      3A.

4    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Molly -- don't touch that!

5    ANGLE ON MOLLY

	leaning over the Alamo model, playing with some of
	the miniature soldiers. The model -- as we all know
	-- is enormous and takes up a large portion of the
	room.

					MOLLY
			I let you play with my toys.

					O'BRIEN
			It's not a toy -- it's a model.

					KEIKO
				(teasing)
			Then maybe it belongs in a
			museum.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER       4.

5    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			I suppose I could give it to
			Julian...

					KEIKO
			Sounds good to me. Speaking of
			Julian... have you told him about
			Starfleet's offer yet?

					O'BRIEN
			I haven't had time.

					MOLLY
			I knew it.

					O'BRIEN
			What's that supposed to mean?

					MOLLY
			We're not going back to Earth.

					O'BRIEN
			Of course we are. Daddy's going
			to teach at the Academy -- as
			soon as the war's over.

					MOLLY
			Then why haven't you told Julian?

					KEIKO
				(smiling)
			Out of the mouth of babes...


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER       5.

5    CONTINUED:	(2)

					O'BRIEN
			I'll tell him.
				(a beat)
			When I think he's ready to hear
			it.
				(to Kirayoshi)
			I love you. Be a good boy, now.
				(to Molly)
			And you listen to Mommy while I'm
			gone.

					MOLLY

			I always listen to Mommy.

	He kisses Molly and Kirayoshi, then hugs and kisses
	Keiko.

					KEIKO
			Just you be careful.

					O'BRIEN
			I always am.

	They hold each other extra tight.

6    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	KASIDY is lying on the couch, GROANING softly, as
	CAPTAIN SISKO places a cold compress on her
	forehead.

					SISKO
			How's that?

					KASIDY
			It's doing wonders for my head.
			But it's my stomach that's
			bothering me...


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER       6.

6    CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Well, if it helps -- morning
			sickness usually ends after the
			first trimester.

					KASIDY
			That's two more months! I don't
			think I'm going to make it.

					SISKO
			You'll make it.

	Kasidy lays her head against Sisko's chest.

					KASIDY
			Promise me something, Ben...
				(patting her
				stomach)
			... promise you'll come back to
			us.

					SISKO
			I promise.

	Kasidy pulls away from Sisko with sudden distress.

					KASIDY
			I don't believe it...

					SISKO

				(defensive)
			I said I promise.

					KASIDY
				(hit by another wave
				of nausea)
			It's not that...

	Kasidy bolts to her feet and makes a beeline for the
	bathroom. Just then, the door CHIMES.

					SISKO
			Come in.

	The door OPENS to REVEAL --

7    JAKE SISKO

	yawning and wiping the sleep from his eyes.


    DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER     7      

7    CONTINUED:

					JAKE
			I thought I'd walk you to the
			Defiant.

					SISKO
			I'd like that.

					JAKE
				(looking around the
				room)
			How's Kas?

	A LOUD GROAN is heard off-screen.

					SISKO
			That answer your question?

	Kasidy reenters the room, looking the worse for
	wear.

					KASIDY
			Reports of my death have been
			exaggerated.
				(a beat)
			But not by much.

	Kasidy lies back down on the couch.

					JAKE
			Isn't there something you can
			take to make you feel better?

					SISKO
			She doesn't believe in taking
			medication unless it's absolutely
			necessary.

	She GROANS again.

					JAKE
			Sounds necessary to me.

					KASIDY
				(to Sisko)
			Waiting for you to leave only
			makes me feel worse. If you're
			going to go -- go.

					SISKO
			You're sure I can't get you
			anything?

	In response, Kasidy gets to her feet and again bolts
	for the bathroom.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER       8.

7    CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			I think she's sure...

					JAKE
			Times like this... I'm glad I'm a
			man.

	And with that, they EXIT into the corridor --

8    INT. QUARK'S

	CLOSE ON QUARK as he places a drink in front of
	WORF. It's still very early and MORN is the only
	other customer.

					QUARK
			You're up early today.

					WORF
			I'm always up early.

					QUARK
			But this is a special day, isn't
			it?

					WORF
			I don't know what you mean.

					QUARK
				(leaning over,
				confidentially)
			It's a good day to die.

					WORF
			Every day is a good day to die.

					QUARK
			But some days are better than
			others. Like today, for
			instance. The day the Federation-
			Klingon-Romulan Alliance launches
			its invasion of Cardassia. The
			final push in the long struggle
			to rid the Alpha Quadrant of the
			Dominion and save my bar in the
			process.

					WORF
				(calmly)
			Who told you that?

					QUARK
				(re: Morn)
			He did.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER       9.

8    CONTINUED:

	Worf looks over to Morn who stares back at him
	blankly.

					WORF
			Morn? And how does he know?


					QUARK
				(joking)
			He's friends with Admiral Ross.
			Or maybe Sisko told him while
			they were having dinner. I don't
			know how he knows. He just
			knows.

	Worf takes a final sip of his drink giving away
	nothing.

					WORF
			I have to go.

	Worf gets up from his stool and EXITS. We hold on a
	triumphant Quark watching him leave.

					QUARK
			Good guess, Morn. Today's the
			day...

9    INT. PROMENADE

	Worf heads for the airlock when ODO joins him.

					ODO
			Mind if I walk with you,
			commander?

					WORF
			Not at all. Captain Sisko
			informed me you were joining us
			on the mission.
				(a beat)
			I hope that when we reach
			Cardassia, we find Colonel Kira
			alive and well.

					ODO
			So do I, commander. So do I...

	Sharing that sentiment, they EXIT into the
	turbolift.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER      10.

10   OMITTED

11   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	Worf, O'Brien, Bashir, Odo and Ezri are at their
	stations with NOG at helm as Sisko steps onto the
	Bridge.

					NOG
			Captain on the bridge.


	All eyes are on Sisko as he stands in front of the
	Captain's Chair. He looks around the room at the
	expectant faces of his crew. After a beat:

					SISKO
			All right, people... what do you
			say we end this war?

					O'BRIEN
			Sounds good to me.

					SISKO
				(to Nog)
			Ensign, I believe you know the
			way to Cardassia.

					NOG
			If I get lost, I'll just follow
			the ship in front of us.

12   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	as the Defiant joins a huge fleet of Federation,
	Klingon and Romulan ships headed for Cardassian
	space. And on that image, we:

									FADE OUT.

                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

	(NOTE:  Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)

13   EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME - SUNSET

	Establishing.

14   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - SUNSET

	CLOSE ON a monitor depicting the Federation fleet
	approaching Cardassian Territory.

15   TIGHT ON WEYOUN

	as he studies the monitor, its display lights
	playing across his face. Weyoun has his game face
	on, staring at the invasion fleet icons with a cold,
	implacable hatred.

					WEYOUN
			The Federation invasion fleet has
			left Deep Space Nine. They'll
			reach the Cardassian border by
			tomorrow night.

	ADJUST to REVEAL the FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER, seated at
	a desk. The changeling disease has her looking as
	dry and desiccated as we've ever seen. And though
	her illness has clearly left her physically
	weakened, her intelligence and intensity remain
	unaffected. The Breen General, THOT PRAN, stands
	nearby.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Thot Pran)
			Our brave Jem'Hadar soldiers have
			a motto "Victory is Life."

	The Breen answers with STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I'm glad you're familiar with it.
			Because today, those words have
			meaning for us all.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      12.

15   CONTINUED:

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (Cont'd)
			The outcome of this battle will
			determine the outcome of the war.
			Either we destroy their invasion
			force or they destroy us. There
			are no other options.

	More Breen STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Fight well today, and Romulus
			will be yours to do with as you
			please.

	More Breen STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Yes, yes -- and Earth too.

	The Breen again offers STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I assure you, the pleasure is all
			mine.

	With a final BURST of STATIC, the Breen steps over
	to a monitor and begins working the console,
	ordering his troops into position.

16   WEYOUN

	can't help but feeling a little jealous at the
	generosity the Female Shape-shifter has shown the
	Breen. The Female Shape-shifter notices Weyoun's
	hurt pride.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Is something bothering you?

					WEYOUN
			Apparently, I was under the
			mistaken impression that all
			Federation territories would fall
			under my jurisdiction -- including
			Earth.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			And so they shall.

					WEYOUN
			But you just promised the
			Breen...


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      13.

16   CONTINUED:

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I'd promise the Breen the entire
			Alpha Quadrant if I thought it
			would help win this war.

	The two stare at each other for a moment, then
	Weyoun bows his head.

					WEYOUN
			The Founder is wise in all
			things.

16A  NEW ANGLE

	as the newly appointed leader of the Cardassian
	Union, LEGATE BROCA, ENTERS. He bows reverentially
	to the Female Shape-shifter.

					BROCA
			Founder. I've heard a disturbing
			rumor about the traitor Damar.

					WEYOUN
			What about him?

					BROCA
			He may be alive.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Weyoun)
			Is this possible?

					WEYOUN
			I don't see how. We destroyed
			his ship, his rebel bases...

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			But his body was never found.

					BROCA
			They say he's here -- on
			Cardassia Prime. In the capital,
			no less...

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Broca)
			Look into this matter.

					WEYOUN
			And if Damar is alive...


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE     13A.

16A  CONTINUED:

					BROCA
			... he won't be for long.

	Weyoun smiles; he can think of nothing that would
	give him greater pleasure than the sight of Damar
	lying dead at his feet.

17   EXT. CARDASSIAN ALLEY - NIGHT

	Seemingly deserted except for TWO JEM'HADAR soldiers
	on patrol. Once they pass out of frame, GARAK and
	DAMAR come out of the shadows and stealthily make
	their way in the opposite direction.

18   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	as they move down the alleyway, hugging the walls.
	Suddenly, a bright beam of light floods the area
	around them followed immediately by a PHASER BOLT
	slamming into the wall by their heads.

					JEM'HADAR VOICE
			Halt.

	Squinting in the light, they see --


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      14.

19   TWO JEM'HADAR SOLDIERS

	standing further down the alley, blocking their
	path. One of them holds a Jem'Hadar palm beacon on
	them at all times.

					JEM'HADAR
			Step forward. Slowly.

	Garak and Damar exchange a worried look, but they
	both realize they have little choice but to do as
	instructed.

					GARAK
				(to the Jem'Hadar)
			Have we done something wrong?
			We're new to the city and I'm
			afraid we've gotten lost --

					JEM'HADAR
			Quiet!

	The Jem'Hadar steps up to get a closer look at the
	two Cardassians.

					JEM'HADAR
			You are Legate Damar.

					GARAK
				(to Damar)
			You see? I told you you looked
			like him.
				(to the Jem'Hadar)
			This isn't the first time my
			cousin has been mistaken for that
			traitor.

					JEM'HADAR
				(unswayed)
			He will be taken to Dominion
			Headquarters. You will die here.

	The Jem'Hadar soldier points his weapon directly at
	Garak. Just then, we hear a burst of odd-sounding
	BREEN STATIC (actually, it sounds like someone
	mimicking Breen static). The Jem'Hadar shines his
	beacon on a --

20   BREEN SOLDIER

	standing at the other end of the alley. The Breen
	soldier approaches and repeats the muffled STATIC.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      15.

20   CONTINUED:

					JEM'HADAR
				(to the Breen)
			I do not understand you.

	The Breen soldier, now only few feet away, lifts up
	his weapon and FIRES --

21   HITTING THE TWO JEM'HADAR (OPTICAL)

	who fall dead.

22   GARAK AND DAMAR

	look on with surprise. Help from a Breen was the
	last thing they expected.

23   THE BREEN SOLDIER

	steps up to the bodies of the two Jem'Hadar and
	takes off (his) helmet, REVEALING KIRA.

					GARAK
			I hope you don't consider me
			ungrateful, but what are you
			doing here?

					KIRA
			Watching your backs.

					DAMAR
			I thought we agreed it would be
			safer if you stayed out of sight.

					KIRA
			That's what the helmet's for.
			You should be wearing one, too.
			Every Jem'Hadar and Breen soldier
			on Cardassia is looking for you.

					DAMAR
			If I'm going to lead this revolt,
			I can't do it hiding in a cellar.
			I had to attend tonight's
			gathering.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      16.

23   CONTINUED:

					GARAK
				(to Kira)
			It was a great success.

					KIRA
			You can tell me the details
			later.

	Kira puts back the helmet.

					KIRA
				(muffled)
			If anyone asks, you're my
			prisoners.

	And with that, she marches them down the alley --

24   INT. CARDASSIAN CELLAR - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON a pair of feet coming down the stairs.
	It's MILA, carrying a tray of food, which she sets
	on the table near Kira, Garak and Damar. The Breen
	outfit lies discarded behind Kira.

					GARAK
				(to Kira)
			... the vote was unanimous. The
			work disruptions will begin
			tomorrow.

					DAMAR
				(also to Kira)
			Power, transportation and
			communication facilities
			throughout Cardassia will be
			sabotaged.

					GARAK
			The Dominion fleet will be cut
			off from all ground support.

					KIRA
				(she gets it)
			That way, they'll have to face
			the invasion force on their own.

					DAMAR
			And once the Dominion is
			crushed...

					MILA (O.S.)
			Cardassia will be free again.

	All eyes turn to Mila.


       DEEP SPACE NINE:'What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      17.

24   CONTINUED:

					MILA
				(to Garak)
			When you were a small boy, I was
			worried about you. Always getting
			in trouble. Secretive... so full
			of deceit. Little did I know you
			would turn such distasteful
			characteristics into virtues.
				(a beat)
			More tea?

					GARAK
			You're too kind.

	And as Mila pours him some tea --

25   EXT. SPACE - DEFIANT (OPTICAL)(STOCK)

	moving with the Federation/Klingon/Romulan fleet.

26   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	As before. Sisko is standing between the Captain's
	Chair and helm, listening intently to a sound we
	can't hear.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      18.

26   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			You hear that, Chief?

					O'BRIEN
				(nodding)
			Sounds like the Doppler
			compensators are out of phase.

	O'Brien begins working his panel.

					SISKO
				(to Nog)
			How's she handling, ensign?

					NOG
			She's not quite as smooth as the
			old Defiant, sir. Feels a bit
			sluggish.

					SISKO
			Chief?

					O'BRIEN
			I'm on it.
				(to the com)
			O'Brien to Engineering.
			Recalibrate the inertial dampers
			and check the plasma flow
			regulators while you're at it.

					ENGINEERING COM VOICE
			Right away, Chief.


	O'Brien, who has yet to tell Bashir about his plans
	to return to Earth, isn't in the best of moods. He
	continues to work his panel.

					O'BRIEN
				(muttering)
			You'd think someone would've come
			up with a a better inertial
			control system...

					BASHIR
			What's that, Miles?

					O'BRIEN
			I said, could you please wipe
			that grin off your face? You're
			not the first person to fall in
			love, you know.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      19.

26   CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
			I thought you'd be happy for me.

					O'BRIEN
				(gruffly)
			I am happy for you.
				(to com)
			O'Brien to Engineering. Now try
			re-aligning the induction coils.

					ENGINEERING COM VOICE
			Will do.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Bashir)
			Look, Julian... there's something
			I have to talk to you about.

					BASHIR
			You're getting pressure from
			Keiko, aren't you?

					O'BRIEN
				(surprised)
			How'd you know?

					BASHIR
			It's a big decision. I'm
			surprised it didn't come up
			sooner.

					O'BRIEN
			Actually, we've been talking
			about it for quite a while.

					BASHIR
			Well, you can stop talking about
			it.
				(magnanimous)
			We'll put the Alamo in my
			quarters.

					NOG
				(re: the helm)
			I could still use a little more
			equalization on the torque buffers.

					O'BRIEN
			Right. I'll try to compensate
			with the impulse response filters.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE     19A.


26   CONTINUED:	(3)

					BASHIR
				(to O'Brien, re: the model)
			That way, your quarters won't be
			so cluttered and you can still
			use it whenever you want.

					O'BRIEN
			I wasn't talking about the Alamo
			model. Besides, it's too big for
			your quarters.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      20.

26   CONTINUED:	(4)

					BASHIR
			You let me worry about that. So
			what did you want to talk to me
			about?


	O'Brien just can't bring himself to tell Julian the
	news about his leaving.

					O'BRIEN
			It's nothing that can't wait.
				(working his panel)
			Is that any better, Nog?

					NOG
				(nodding)
			Torque buffers are stable.

27   ANGLE ON EZRI AND WORF

	as they work their consoles, side by side.

					EZRI
			You're sure you're not angry?

					WORF
			Why should I be angry? I've been
			asking you to tell the doctor how
			you feel about him for the past
			month.

					EZRI
			Well, now that he knows how I
			feel...

					WORF
			I am happy for you.

					EZRI
			That's a relief.

					WORF
				(dry)
			... but I am going to kill him.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      21.

27   CONTINUED:

	Ezri shoots him a look --

					EZRI
			You're kidding, right?

					WORF
			And Jadzia said I had no sense of
			humor.

28   ANGLE ON A PENSIVE ODO

	as Sisko approaches him.

					SISKO
			I wish she were here, too,
			Constable.

					ODO
			If I only knew where Kira was...
			that she was all right...


					SISKO
			The colonel's a survivor. She
			knows how to take care of
			herself.

	Odo tries to find comfort in his words, but it isn't
	easy.

					ODO
			This war, captain... it has to
			end.

					SISKO
			One way or another... it will.
			And soon.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      22.

29   CLOSER ON SISKO (OPTICAL)

	as he leans back in his chair and we push in tight
	on his face. Suddenly, a BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT FILLS
	THE SCREEN --

30   INT. PROMENADE - VISION (OPTICAL)

	We hear the characteristic HEARTBEAT sound as Sisko
	finds himself standing before SARAH PROPHET in front
	of the Bajoran Shrine.

					SISKO
			Mother?

					SARAH PROPHET
			The Emissary's task is nearing
			completion.

					SISKO
			Are you talking about the war?

					SARAH PROPHET
			You have walked the path the
			Prophets laid out for you,
			Benjamin. Do not falter now.

					SISKO
			I don't intend to.

	Sarah Prophet steps closer to Sisko and caresses his
	cheek.

					SARAH PROPHET
			Know this, my son. Your
			journey's end lies not before
			you, but behind you.

	And as she lowers her hand, the SCREEN WHITES OUT
	and we --

									CUT TO:

31   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	CLOSE ON Sisko as he comes out of his vision.

					ODO
			Captain?


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      23.

31   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(pensive)
			The Prophets just came to me in a
			vision...

					ODO
			I take it they weren't bringing
			good news.

					SISKO
			I'm not sure. I suppose only
			time will tell.

	And off this moment --

32   EXT. BAJOR - DAY (STOCK)

	Establishing.

33   INT. KAI WINN'S OFFICE - DAY

	KAI WINN is sitting alone in her office reading the
	text of the Kosst Amojan. We hear the door OPEN.

					DUKAT (O.S.)
			Hello, Adami.

	The Kai doesn't look up, she merely turns another
	page in the book.

					WINN
			You're back.

	ADJUST to REVEAL DUKAT, still a Bajoran, but no
	longer blind. His clothes are dusty and ragged.

					DUKAT
			Is that all you have to say to
			me?

	The Kai looks up for the first time, giving Dukat a
	quick once over.

					WINN
			I see the Pah-wraiths have
			restored your sight.

	Determined to get back in her good graces, Dukat
	hides his anger behind a humble smile.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE     23A.

33   CONTINUED:

					DUKAT
			They've forgiven me. I hope you
			can find it in your heart to do
			the same.

	Winn leans back in her chair.

					WINN
			I don't forgive war criminals.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      24.

33   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WINN (Cont'd)
			To think I took Gul Dukat to my
			bed, one of the most hated men in
			Bajoran history...

					DUKAT
			Adami -- I've told you how much I
			regret my actions during the
			occupation...

					WINN
				(scornful)
			Of course you do.

	Dukat looks over at the text the Kai's been
	studying.

					DUKAT
				(glad to change the
				subject)
			Have you learned how to release
			the Pah-wraiths?

					WINN
				(nodding)
			The secrets of the Kosst Amojan
			have been revealed to me.

					DUKAT
			Then why haven't you gone to the
			Fire Caves and freed them?

					WINN
				(with a beguiling
				smile)
			I was waiting for you.

	This is exactly what Dukat was hoping to hear.

					DUKAT
			So you do forgive me...

	She gets up from behind the desk and crosses over to
	him.

					WINN
			I need your help, Dukat. It's as
			simple as that.

					DUKAT
			All you have to do is ask.

	Dukat takes Kai Winn's hand, cupping it in his.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE      25.

33   CONTINUED:	(3)

					DUKAT
			Together we'll free the Pah-
			wraiths so they can lay claim to
			the Celestial Temple and destroy
			the Prophets.

					WINN
			And their Emissary...

					DUKAT
			No -- Benjamin Sisko will be
			dealt with by me and me alone.

					WINN
			Assuming he survives the invasion
			of Cardassia.

					DUKAT
			He'll survive... but I promise
			you, he'll wish he hadn't.

	And as Dukat and Winn savor their approaching
	victory, we:

									FADE OUT.

35   INT. HOLOSUITE - VIC'S LOUNGE

	Quark intently studies a hand of playing cards he's
	holding close to his face.

					QUARK
			Do you have any threes?

	ADJUST to include VIC FONTAINE seated across from
	Quark, studying his own hand.

					VIC
			Go fish.

	Quark sighs with disappointment and throws the cards
	down.

					VIC
			Don't tell me you're quitting?

					QUARK
			It's just not my game.

					VIC
			Want to try pinochle again?

	Quark shakes his head.

					VIC
			How 'bout rummy? Or gin rummy?
			Five card stud?
				(a beat)
			Canasta?

	But Quark doesn't want to play any of them.

					QUARK
			How about some tongo?

					VIC
				(rhetorically)
			Did they play tongo in Las Vegas
			in nineteen sixty-two?


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO      27.

35   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			How could they? It's a Ferengi
			game.

					VIC
			Which is why my holographic
			program can't create it.

					QUARK
			I know, I know this place is
			period specific. For a hologram,
			you're not very accommodating.

					VIC
			Is that why you dropped by? To
			insult me?

					QUARK
			I dropped by because I had
			nothing else to do. My bar
			hasn't had half a dozen customers
			all day. Everyone's off fighting
			this stupid war.

	But Vic knows what's really bothering him.

					VIC
			It's not easy to stay behind, is
			it? Knowing that your friends
			are out there risking their
			lives...

	But Quark refuses to admit it.

					QUARK
			They think they have it rough,
			they should try living my life
			for a day. The hospitality
			industry isn't for the faint-
			hearted.

					VIC
			The bartender's life is a lonely
			one.

					QUARK
			That's right. But few people
			understand that. They think it's
			one big, happy party. They
			forget that the person giving the
			party never has any fun.       DEEP SPACE NINE:'What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO      28.

35   CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK (Cont'd)
			He's too busy making sure
			everybody else is having fun.
				(a beat)
			All I do -- all day long -- is
			give, give, give...

					VIC
			Bartending is a very noble
			profession. And you do it well
			under some very difficult
			circumstances, I might add. You
			should be proud.

					QUARK
			You think so?

					VIC
			I know so, pallie.

	But Quark is still bothered by a deeper issue.

					QUARK
			I just hope Nog and the rest of
			those heroic idiots come back in
			one piece..

	Just then, GINGER -- the girl last seen as Vic's
	date in "His Way" -- approaches, dressed for a night
	on the town.

					GINGER
			Vic, sweetie, are you ready?
			Jimmy and Pete are about to go
			on.

					VIC
				(explaining to
				Quark)
			Sorry, pallie, gotta run.
			Durante and Lawford are at the
			Sands. Can't miss that.

	Vic gets up and walks over to Ginger, who slips her
	arm through his.

					QUARK
			I thought you said a bartender's
			life was a lonely one?

					VIC
				(what can I say?)
			It is. But I'm not a bartender.

	And with that, Vic and Ginger EXIT. We hold on
	Quark for a beat as he sighs with resignation.

37   INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES (SECOND LEVEL CAVES)

	The caves are hot and steamy, the walls dripping
	with moisture. Dukat and Winn ENTER. Dukat carries
	a backpack containing various ceremonial artifacts.
	He doesn't seem bothered by the heat. In fact, he
	finds it invigorating. On the other hand, Kai Winn,
	who holds the text of the Kosst Amojan nestled in
	her arms, looks like she's about to melt. After a
	few steps, she stops to catch her breath, leaning
	against a rock.

					DUKAT
				(impatient)
			Is it really necessary to rest so
			often?

					WINN
			I don't need you to wait for me.
			Go on ahead... wander aimlessly
			through these caves for the rest
			of your miserable life.

					DUKAT
			I'm in no hurry.
				(looking around)
			During the Occupation, my people
			found the Bajorans' fear of these
			caves amusing.
				(a beat)
			Yet somehow, none of us ever
			found the time to visit them.
			And now, here I am... Ironic,
			isn't it?

					WINN
			I don't care.

					DUKAT
				(surprised by her
				bluntness)
			Excuse me?

					WINN
			I'm sure you have many
			"interesting" anecdotes about the
			Occupation, but I have no desire
			to hear them.

					DUKAT
			I meant no disrespect, Adami --

					WINN
			And stop calling me Adami. That
			privilege is no longer yours.

					WINN
			From now on, you will address me

			Perfectly... eminence.

	And with that, Kai Winn gets up and resumes their
	trek through the caverns.

38   EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME - DUSK (OPTICAL)(STOCK)

	Re-establishing.

39   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - DUSK

	Thot Pran stands in front of the Female
	Shape-shifter, who remains seated at her desk. The
	Breen General is mid-STATIC. Weyoun stands by a
	monitor.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Thot Pran)
			I see your point. But for two
			millennia the Jem'Hadar have been
			the Dominion's first line of
			defense. It would damage their
			morale to take a back seat to the
			Breen.

	The Breen erupts with more STATIC. Whatever he's
	saying, he's saying it emphatically.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Very well. In the spirit of our
			new alliance, I will inform the
			Jem'Hadar that the Breen forces
			will be positioned alongside
			them.

	The Breen answers, somewhat mollified.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I'm glad that pleases you.

	But Weyoun isn't quite satisfied with the situation.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO     30A.

39   CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN
				(half to himself)
			I think we have a problem.

	The Female Shape-shifter and Thot Pran turn their
	attention to Weyoun. Thot Pran lets out a BURST of
	STATIC.


					WEYOUN
			Our lines are spread too thin,
			especially here --
				(pointing)
			-- at the center.

	The Female Shape-shifter slowly and painfully rises
	out of her chair and walks over to the monitor.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to the Breen)
			Do you agree?

	Thot Pran looks at the monitor then answers with
	some Breen STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Weyoun)
			Notify the Jem'Hadar. Order them
			to reinforce the center of their
			lines...


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO      31.

39   CONTINUED:	(2)

	But before the Shape-shifter can complete her
	thought, there is a POWER OUTAGE that dims the
	lights and blanks out the monitor.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Now what?

	The Breen General shouts some STATIC. After a few
	moments, the lights and monitor come back to life as
	the emergency backup systems kick in.

	Just then, a concerned Legate Broca hurries in.

					BROCA
			Founder -- I'm relieved to see
			you're all right.

					WEYOUN
			Long range communications are
			down. I can't contact the
			Jem'Hadar.

	More BREEN STATIC from Thot Pran.

					WEYOUN
				(peevish)
			Of course I'll keep trying.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Broca)
			What caused the power failure?

					BROCA
			I'm afraid it was sabotage.

					WEYOUN
				(off his monitor)
			Almost every Dominion
			installation on Cardassia Prime
			has suffered damage.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(a curse)
			Damar.

					BROCA
			We captured some of the
			terrorists...
				(nervous)
			But they're not soldiers --
			they're ordinary citizens.

	The Female Shape-shifter grabs Broca by the throat.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO      32.

39   CONTINUED:	(3)

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Are you telling me the Cardassian
			people are rising up against us?

					BROCA
				(struggling to get
				the words out)
			I'm sure it's only a small number
			of malcontents...

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			We have no way of knowing that,
			do we?

					WEYOUN
			Founder, may I make a suggestion?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(still strangling
				Broca)
			I'm sure Broca is most interested
			in what you have to say.

					WEYOUN
			If the Cardassian people are
			responsible for these acts of
			terrorism... if Damar and his
			fanatics have turned them against
			us, then it's the people who
			should be punished.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Broca)
			What do you say to that?

					BROCA
				(barely croaking out
				the words)
			Severely punished.

	With that, the Female Shape-shifter finally releases
	Broca from her grip.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I'm glad we're all in agreement.

	And with that, we:

40   OMITTED

41   EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME - DUSK

	Re-establishing.

42   INT. CARDASSIAN CELLAR - DUSK 


	The room is dark. All power has been cut off by the
	various acts of sabotage sweeping Cardassia. The only
	light source is a small, emergency lightstick. Kira,
	Damar and Garak are huddled over a Cardassian PADD.

					DAMAR
				(re: the PADD)
			It's been twenty-four minutes.

					KIRA
			Not bad.

					GARAK
			If the Dominion hasn't been able
			to restore power in the capital,
			then the entire planet must be in
			chaos...

					DAMAR
			Let's hope so.

	Mila comes down the stairs, holding a couple of
	extra lightsticks.

					MILA
			I'm afraid I could only find two
			more lightsticks. I know there are
			others in the house somewhere...

					GARAK
			Stop dawdling and bring them over
			here.

	Mila does as instructed.

					MILA
			Ah, how well I remember that tone
			of voice... it reminds me of the
			demanding and inconsiderate boy
			ou used to be.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE     34.


42   CONTINUED:

					GARAK
			I haven't changed much, have I?

					DAMAR
				(off the PADD)
			This will send a clear message to
			the Dominion... the Cardassian
			people will fight to regain
			their freedom.

					KIRA
			I hope they realize their fight
			is just beginning. We have to
			hit the enemy again -- and harder
			this time.

					GARAK
			That won't be easy. They'll have
			tightened their security.

					KIRA
			It doesn't matter -- we can't
			lose our momentum.

	Damar smiles.


					DAMAR
				(to Garak)
			The colonel is right. We can't
			rest until Cardassia is free.
				(a beat, to Kira)
			And when it is, we'll have you to
			thank. Without you, this
			rebellion would've died in its
			infancy.

					GARAK
				(agreeing)
			How ironic that Cardassia's
			saviour should be a former
			Bajoran terrorist.

					KIRA
			Don't canonize me just yet.

	Suddenly, the lights come back on as the power is
	reinstated.

					DAMAR
				(off the PADD)
			Twenty-six and a half minutes.
			Let's see what the Dominion has
			to say for itself.

	Garak moves over to the monitor and taps a few keys.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE    34A.

43   ANGLE ON THE MONITOR (OPTICAL)


	coming to life with the image of Weyoun beginning a
	planetwide address.

					WEYOUN
			Citizens of Cardassia... shame on
			you. This latest wave of
			vandalism directed against your
			Dominion allies must stop.

	INTERCUT with Kira, Damar, Garak and Mila watching.

					GARAK
			I wouldn't count on it.

					WEYOUN
				(on the monitor)
			Let me assure you, we know that
			these disgraceful acts of
			sabotage were carried out by a
			mere handful of extremists. But
			these radicals must come to
			realize that their disobedience
			will not be tolerated... that
			you, the Cardassian people, will
			suffer the consequences of their
			cowardly actions. Which is why I
			must inform you that a few
			moments ago, Dominion troops
			reduced Lakarian City to ashes.
				(a beat)
			There were no survivors. Two
			million men, women and
			children... gone in a matter of
			seconds..


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE     35.

44   ANGLE ON KIRA AND THE OTHERS

	as they react to the grim news.

45   BACK ON WEYOUN (OPTICAL)

	continuing his address.

					WEYOUN
				(a beat)
			For each act of sabotage
			committed against the Dominion,
			another Cardassian city will be
			destroyed.
				(a beat)
			I implore you not to let that
			happen. Let us return to the spirit
			of friendship and cooperation that
			has existed between our peoples, so
			that together, we can defeat our
			common enemies... the Federation,
			the Klingons, the Romulans and all
			the others who stand against us.
			Thank you.

	And with that, Weyoun's image is replaced by the
	Dominion logo.

46   ANGLE ON KIRA AND THE OTHERS

	as the impact of Weyoun's words sink in. For a
	moment, the only sound we hear is Mila's soft
	weeping.

					DAMAR
			I should've killed that Vorta
			jackal when I had the chance.

					KIRA
			You want another one?
				(off Damar's look)
			Then let's attack Dominion
			Headquarters.

					GARAK
				(agreeing)
			Chop off a snake's head and its
			body dies...

					KIRA
			Damar -- for the past two years,
			you practically lived in that
			building...


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE     36.

46   CONTINUED:

					DAMAR
			If you're asking me if I know a
			way to get us inside, the answer
			is no -- not without valid
			security protocols.

					KIRA
			Then we'll have to force our way
			in --
				(to Garak)
			We'll need some kind of explosive
			device.

					GARAK
			I'll get right on it.

					MILA
			What you're proposing... is
			suicide.

					GARAK
			Mila, if you don't have anything
			positive to say...

	Mila can see that she's not going to talk them out
	of their plans.

					MILA
			I'll prepare some food. No one
			should die on an empty stomach.

	And as she heads up the steps --

46A  INT. ANOTHER SECTION OF FIRE CAVES

	CLOSE ON Dukat wincing with pain as Kai Winn tries
	to remove an insect stinger from his neck.

					WINN
				(annoyed)
			Be still.

					DUKAT
			I am being still. What's taking
			so long?

					WINN
			The stinger is embedded in your
			skin.

					DUKAT
				(temper flaring)
			I know that.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE    36A.

46A  CONTINUED:

	Dukat winces again.

					WINN
			Does it hurt?

					DUKAT
			Of course it hurts. Have you
			ever been stung by a cave-wasp?

					WINN
			Not that I recall. I warned you
			not to slap at it.

					DUKAT
			It was annoying me.

	Squeezing a little harder, Winn manages to pinch the
	stinger with her nails and yank it out. Dukat
	GRUNTS with pain.

					WINN
			There. Is that better?

					DUKAT
			Not really. This Bajoran skin is
			so... delicate.

					WINN
			Then perhaps you should've stayed
			a Cardassian.

					DUKAT
			Nothing would've made me happier.
			But I needed to win your trust.

	Dukat reaches out and takes Winn's hand.

					DUKAT
			And you have to trust me. Only
			together can we free the Pah-
			wraiths.

	Winn doesn't pull her hand away.

					DUKAT
			You still care about me, don't
			you?
				(a beat)
			Don't you?

	Now Winn does pull her hand away.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE    36B.

46A  CONTINUED:	(2)

					WINN
			All I care about is freeing the
			Pah-wraiths.

					DUKAT
			That's not true and you know it.

					WINN
			You may look like a Bajoran, but
			your ego is unmistakably
			Cardassian.

					DUKAT
			I'll take that as a compliment.

					WINN
			Of course you will.
				(a beat)
			Now do us both a favor... next
			time you see a cave-wasp, leave
			it alone.

	And with that, Winn turns her back to Dukat and
	continues her trek through the cavern.

					DUKAT
			I'll try to remember that.

47   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	to see the formidable Dominion, Cardassian and Breen
	forces, as they prepare for battle.

48   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)(STOCK)

	to see the Federation invasion fleet move past in

					MARTOK
			They are. And I haven't
			forgotten the promise I made to
			both of you.

					SISKO
			That the three of us would share
			a bottle of bloodwine on
			Cardassia Prime.

					MARTOK
			A bottle? I brought a barrel of
			twenty-three-oh-nine -- there is
			no finer vintage.

					ROSS
			Then I'll meet you two on
			Cardassia.

					MARTOK
			We'll see who gets there first.

	CLOSE ON Sisko's reaction as Martok and Ross end
	their transmissions.

			Stay with him.

					NOG
			I'm trying, but he's slippery...

					SISKO
			Mister Worf?

					WORF
			Unable to lock target.

	The Defiant is ROCKED by a series of hits. One of the

					ODO
			We have two Jem'Hadar ships

	Mila picks up Damar's empty plate.

					MILA
			So has Legate Damar.

					GARAK
			What about him?

					MILA
			He finished everything on his

85   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE

	Odo is the first to react to the startling
	development --

					ODO
			Sir -- the Cardassians... they're
			attacking the other Dominion
			ships.

					EZRI
				(surprised)
			I think they've switched sides.

					NOG
				(gleeful)
			Yes!

					SISKO
			It couldn't come at a better
			time.
				(an order)
			Come about and head for the
			center of their lines. This is
			our chance to punch through.

					NOG
			Aye, sir.

86   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)(STOCK)

	as the Defiant swoops around, and heads for the
	Dominion lines.

87   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	CLOSE ON Weyoun at the monitor.

					WEYOUN
				(good news)
			Founder -- long range
			communications are back on-line.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It's about time.

	The Female Shape-shifter, Thot Pran and Legate Broca
	exchange a look of relief, but it's short-lived:

					WEYOUN
				(off his monitor,
				shocked)
			I don't believe it...


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE    50A.

87   CONTINUED:

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			What now?

					WEYOUN
			The Cardassian fleet has turned
			against us.

	The Breen General lets loose with some particularly
	loud STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(taking charge)
			Have our forces pull back and
			regroup at Cardassia Prime.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE     51.

87   CONTINUED:	(2)

					WEYOUN
			But we'll be completely
			surrounded.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			There'll be no more running.

	More Breen STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(agreeing)
			We should've rid ourselves of the
			Cardassians at the first sign of
			rebellion.

	All eyes turn to Broca, who suddenly fears for his
	life.

					BROCA
			If I could speak to the rebels...
			get them to change their minds...

					WEYOUN
			Perhaps you could reawaken their
			patriotic spirit...

					BROCA
			Exactly.

					WEYOUN
			On the other hand, they're just
			as likely to convince you to
			betray us.

					BROCA
			Me betray you? Never!

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			You're right. Because we're not
			going to give you the
			opportunity.

	The Female Shape-shifter gestures to the two
	Jem'Hadar guards, who quickly grab Broca by the
	arms.

					BROCA
			Wait! You're making a mistake...

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I don't think so.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE    51A.

87   CONTINUED:	(3)

					BROCA
				(shouting)
			But I've done everything you've
			asked! I tell you -- I'm loyal.
			I believe in the Dominion!

	And with words falling on deaf ears --

87A  ON WEYOUN

	watching Broca get dragged out the door.

					WEYOUN
				(matter of fact)
			I won't miss him.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I want the Cardassians
			exterminated.

					WEYOUN
			Which ones?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			All of them. The entire
			population.

					WEYOUN
			That's going to take some time.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Then I suggest you begin at once.

	Weyoun nods and EXITS, ready to carry out his task.

88   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Dominion fleet disengages the Federation forces

					WORF
			Captain -- the Dominion forces

			Prime.

	A spontaneous CHEER erupts on the Bridge.

					EZRI
			Sir -- Admiral Ross and
			Chancellor Martok would like to

					SISKO
			I'm sure they would. On screen.

90   ANGLE ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	to see a split screen with Admiral Ross and Martok
	speaking from their respective ships.

					ROSS
			I never thought I'd say this, but
			thank god for the Cardassians.

					MARTOK
			As I predicted -- the day is
			ours.

					SISKO
			Not yet it isn't.

					ROSS
			Ben, we've driven the Dominion
			back to Cardassia Prime. We can
			keep them bottled-up there
			indefinitely.

					SISKO
			But what if they use that time to
			rebuild their fleet?

					MARTOK
				(agreeing)
			The Dominion has displayed an
			ability to build ships at an
			impressive rate. We must
			continue our attack.

					ROSS
			At what cost?


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE     53.

90   CONTINUED:

					ROSS (Cont'd)
			We've already lost a third of our
			fleet.

					MARTOK
			And we must see to it that those
			soldiers did not die in vain.

					SISKO
			Admiral -- with the Cardassians
			joining us, we have an
			opportunity to put an end to this
			war, once and for all.

	The Admiral takes a moment to weigh his decision.

					ROSS
			All right, gentlemen... we press
			on.

					MARTOK
			My people will sing songs about
			this moment.

91   ANGLE ON SISKO

	as the transmission ends. He addresses his crew.

					SISKO
			All right, people. You heard the

93   DUKAT

					WINN
			What's the matter, Dukat? You

94   ANGLE OVER DUKAT'S SHOULDER OF THE ABYSS (OPTICAL) 

	which seems to plunge away into a bottomless pit.

					DUKAT
			I know this sounds naive, but I

95   ON KAI WINN

	as she kneels onto the ground and opens the book of
	the Kosst Amojan.

					WINN
			And with good reason.

	The Kai closes her eyes, lowers her head, and begins

97   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Winn looks over to Dukat, who stands in awe at the
	sight of the fiery canyon.

					WINN
			Is that better?

	Dukat, too overcome to speak, simply nods and smiles
	with anticipation at what is to come. And on that
	image, we:

									FADE OUT.

	Re-establishing.

99   INT. CARDASSIAN CELLAR - DAY

	Kira, Damar and Ekoor are making last minute

	are also checking their weapons.

					EKOOR
				(to Damar, looking
				at a PADD)
			According to this map, it's a
			long way from the cargo door to
			the briefing room.

					KIRA
			That could be a problem. If we
			get trapped in one of the

	But before Kira can complete her thought, an
	OFFSCREEN EXPLOSION rattles the walls, startling
	everyone.

					KIRA
			What the hell --

100  ANGLE ON GARAK

	rushing down the stairs.

					GARAK
			The Jem'Hadar... they're leveling
			the city, building by building.

					KIRA
				(to Damar)
			We have to go -- now.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX      57.

100  CONTINUED:

	Damar addresses the rest of the group.

					DAMAR
			Once we get inside the complex,
			we stop at nothing until we
			capture the changeling.
				(to all)
			For Cardassia.

	The others repeat the refrain: "FOR CARDASSIA!"
	That is, everyone except Kira... and with the SHOUTS
	still ringing in their ears, Damar leads Ekoor and
	the two other Cardassians up the steps --

101  ANGLE ON KIRA

	about to follow, when she notices Garak standing
	silently over the tarp-covered body of Mila.

					KIRA
			Garak --

					GARAK
			During all my years of exile... I
			imagined what it would be like to
			come home... maybe even to live
			in this house again with Mila.
				(a beat)
			But now she's dead and this house
			is about to become a pile of
			rubble...
				(a beat)
			My Cardassia is gone.

					KIRA
			Then fight for a new Cardassia.

	ANOTHER EXPLOSION -- this one, even louder and
	closer -- rattles the walls.

					GARAK
			I have a better reason than that,
			colonel. Revenge.

	And with that, he turns away from Mila and walks
	past Kira up the stairs.

					KIRA
				(to herself)
			That can work, too.

	Winn and Dukat stand before the fiery canyon, the
	red glow dancing across their faces.

105  ON THE KAI

	as she ceremoniously takes off her cap and tosses it
	into the abyss. With equal solemnity, she removes
	her robe and tosses it over the edge as well (Winn
	is now wearing only a simple penitent's smock). She
	takes out the pin holding up her hair, which falls
	to her shoulders.

					WINN
				(smiling)
			I rid myself of the Prophets and
			shed a lifetime of hypocrisy.

	She then turns to Dukat, and to his surprise, grabs
	him in an embrace and kisses him passionately.

					DUKAT
			I've never seen you looking so
			radiant...

					WINN
			I feel like a young woman,
			waiting for my lover to sweep me
			off my feet...

					DUKAT
			Do you give yourself willingly to

					WINN
			With all my heart.

					DUKAT
				(re: the canyon)
			Then call to them.

	Winn breaks their embrace.

105  CONTINUED:

					WINN
			Bring me the book.

	Dukat hesitates... he remembers the last time he
	touched it, he was struck blind.

					WINN
			I said, bring it.

	Dukat overcomes his doubts, picks up the book, and
	offers it to her. Winn opens the book as Dukat
	cradles it in his arms. Standing at the very brink
	of the abyss, Winn begins to chant rapidly.

					WINN
			Meek rak dorrah Pah-wran... Yelim

109  AS SISKO

	passes by Nog, he offers the helmsman a gentle pat
	of support on the shoulder.

					NOG
				(re: the Defiant)
			She did pretty well for a first

					SISKO
			I do, ensign.

	Sisko steps over to Worf and Ezri.

					WORF
			Our phaser banks are fully

					SISKO
			That'll have to do.
				(to Ezri)
			How're you holding up, old man?

					EZRI
			All things considered, I'd rather

					SISKO
			That makes two of us.

	Sisko nods a smile and moves over to the other side
	of the ship where Odo is gazing solemnly at his

					ODO

	gathered in the shadows. Garak is studying a
	Cardassian tricorder.

					GARAK
			We have a problem.

					KIRA
			Only one?

					GARAK
			I'm afraid it's a rather large
			one. The cargo door is made of

					KIRA
			Then the explosives we brought

					GARAK
			You see the problem.

					EKOOR
			What do we do?

					DAMAR
			I don't know, but I'm through
			hiding in basements...

	Garak can't suppress a LAUGH.

					DAMAR
			I fail to see what's so funny,
			Garak...

					GARAK
			Isn't it obvious? Here we are,
			ready to storm the castle...
			willing to sacrifice our lives in
			a noble effort to slay the
			Dominion beast in its lair and we
			can't even get inside the gate.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX      65.

116  CONTINUED:

	Garak starts LAUGHING again. Ekoor joins in. Even
	Kira and Damar have to smile.

					KIRA
			We could knock on the door and
			ask the Jem'Hadar to let us in...

					DAMAR
			Or have them send the Female
			Shape-shifter out to us.

	They continue LAUGHING at the absurdity of the
	moment, but after a beat, the laughter dies.

					GARAK
			Like I said, we have a problem...

	And off Garak's sobering words --

116A INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
	(FORMERLY SCENE 102)

	The Female Shape-shifter, looking the worse for wear,
	stands before Thot Pran and his Breen staff. Weyoun

	BREEN STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			But I've come to depend on having
			you here at my side.

	More Breen STATIC.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Your advice has proven invaluable
			to the Dominion.

	Another BURST.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Very well. If you feel that the
			situation demands your presence
			on the front lines, I won't stand
			in your way. Knowing that you
			will be leading our troops into
			battle is very reassuring.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX     65A.

116A CONTINUED:

	Another BURST OF STATIC, then the General bows to
	the Female Shape-shifter before leading his staff out
	the door.

116B ANGLE ON WEYOUN (FORMERLY SCENE 103)

	who has been watching this exchange with great
	interest.

					WEYOUN
			I still can't help but wonder.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Wonder what?

					WEYOUN
			What's under that helmet?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			A braver man than you.
				(a beat)
			Though I do find the shrillness
			of his "voice"... tiresome.

	The Female Shape-shifter turns to walk back to her
	desk when suddenly, her legs give out from under
	her. Weyoun barely manages to catch her and keep
	her on her feet.

					WEYOUN
			Founder -- what's wrong?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(isn't it obvious?)
			I'm dying, that's what's wrong.

					WEYOUN
			Perhaps if you were to rest for a
			while... revert to your natural
			state.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I haven't been able to change
			form in weeks. Ironic, isn't it?
			That I'm going to die as a
			Solid...

					WEYOUN
			You're not going to die.
			You're a god.

	The Female Shape-shifter looks over at Weyoun.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX     65B.

	Weyoun is overwhelmed by this compliment.

					WEYOUN
				(bowing)
			I live only to serve you.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			And you've served me well.
				(a beat, with some
				bitterness)
			I don't mind dying. It's knowing
			that my entire race is dying of
			the same illness and there's
			nothing I can do about it...

					WEYOUN
			I would give my life to save
			yours.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I only wish it were that simple.

	And as the Female Shape-shifter allows Weyoun to lead
	her over to her chair --

116C EXT. DOMINION HEADQUARTERS - CARGO DOCK - NIGHT

	Kira, Garak, Damar, Ekoor and the others remain
	huddled as before, still wrestling with the problem
	of getting inside Dominion Headquarters.

					DAMAR
			What if I were to give myself up?
			Pretend to be your prisoner.

					KIRA
				(shaking her head)
			They'd kill you on sight.

					GARAK
			And us along with you.

	Just then, something offscreen catches Ekoor's eye.

					EKOOR

					GARAK

			He's dead.

	Kira looks over to see that the Cardassians have

	suddenness of Damar's death has taken the wind out
	of the Cardassian's sails.

					KIRA
			Remember Damar's orders -- we

	SOUND of phaser fire in the hallway outside the
	Briefing Room.

					WEYOUN
			Founder... perhaps we should
			consider moving to a safer
			location.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			And where would that be?

	Weyoun isn't quite sure, but before he can come up
	with an answer --

137  THE DOOR

	suddenly EXPLODES OPEN.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX     72B.

138  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)


	to see Kira, Garak, Ekoor and one other ND
	Cardassian rush in, FIRING their weapons --

139  ON THE JEM'HADAR (OPTICAL)

	as one of them takes a hit. However, the other one
	manages to fire his weapon, killing the ND
	Cardassian.

140  KIRA (OPTICAL)

	takes out the last Jem'Hadar, then raises her weapon
	at Weyoun and the Female Shape-shifter.

					WEYOUN
			Colonel Kira -- what a pleasant
			surprise.

					KIRA
			The pleasure's all mine.

	Ekoor moves to a monitor and works the console.

					EKOOR
			The Federation fleet has
			surrounded the planet.

					KIRA
				(to the Female
				Shape-shifter)
			Contact the Jem'Hadar and the
			Breen, order their ships to stand
			down.

					GARAK
			And order their troops on
			Cardassia to do the same.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I'll do no such thing.


	Taking his cue from the Female Shape-shifter, Weyoun
	refuses to appear intimidated.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX      73.

140  CONTINUED:

					WEYOUN
			Tell me, where's my old friend,
			Damar?

					GARAK
			Damar's dead.

					WEYOUN
				(smiling)
			A pity.

					GARAK
			He died helping to free
			Cardassia.

					WEYOUN
			What's left of it.

141  CLOSE ON GARAK

	as his anger boils over. He raises his weapon and
	FIRES, killing Weyoun at point blank range.

142  WIDER

	as the Female Shape-shifter calmly looks at Weyoun's
	corpse.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I wish you hadn't done that.
			That was Weyoun's last clone.

					GARAK
			I was hoping you'd say that.

					KIRA
				(to the Female
				Shape-shifter)
			This war's over -- you've lost.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Have I? I think you'll find that
			neither the Jem'Hadar nor the
			Breen would agree with that
			assessment. They'll fight to the
			last man.

					KIRA
			What will that accomplish?


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX      74.

142  CONTINUED:


					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			Isn't it obvious?

	The Female Shape-shifter, feeling weaker by the
	moment, moves over to her desk to sit down.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(continuing)
			You may win this war,
			colonel... but I promise you,
			by the time it's over, you will
			have lost so many ships... so
			many lives -- that your "victory"
			will taste as bitter as defeat.

	The exhausted Female Shape-shifter leans back in her
	chair, content with the knowledge that the ultimate
	victory will be hers.

143  CLOSE ON KIRA

	as she silently contemplates the Shape-shifter's
	words, we:

									FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT SIX

	FADE IN:

145  INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	as Sisko and Odo talk with Kira on the viewscreen.

					SISKO
			I'm glad to find you in one
			piece, colonel.


					ODO
			Very glad.

	Kira looks at Odo, relieved to see him looking well
	again.

					SISKO
				(to Kira)
			What's your status?

					KIRA
			Only three of us made it to the
			Briefing Room.

					ODO
			What about Damar?

					KIRA
			He's dead.

					SISKO
			Is your position secure?

					KIRA
			I don't think the Jem'Hadar will
			attack -- they won't risk
			endangering the Founder.
				(a beat)
			She's in pretty bad shape. She
			won't speak to anyone... just
			sits at her desk, deteriorating.

					WORF
			If she dies before ordering the
			Jem'Hadar to surrender...

					SISKO
				(finishing the thought)
			They'll fight to the last man.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN     76.

146  ON ODO

	as he reaches a decision.

					ODO
			Captain, I should beam down
			there. The Founder will speak to
			me. Maybe I can reason with her.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN     77.

146  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			You haven't had much success with
			her in the past.

					ODO
			I'd still like to try. Think of
			the lives it could save.

	Sisko thinks about it for a beat, then:

					SISKO
				(turning to
				viewscreen)
			Commander -- tell the Founder
			that Odo would like to pay her a
			visit.

	And with that, Odo heads to the turbolift --

147  INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVERN

	CLOSE ON a flask of wine being poured into a
	ceremonial goblet. ADJUST TO REVEAL Kai Winn
	holding the goblet. Dukat stands near the edge of
	the abyss, still holding the text of the Kosst
	Amojan.

					WINN
			And now we begin the most
			important part of the ceremony.

	Winn then holds the cup above her --

					WINN
			Tarna pur-ono ull-kess pah-ran.
			lano ka'la bo'shar lanu.

	Winn goes to drink from the cup, then hesitates.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN     78.

147  CONTINUED:

					WINN
			After you.

	She offers the cup to Dukat who nods.

					DUKAT
			I'm honored.

	Dukat gently sets the book down on a ledge and takes
	the goblet from Winn. Without hesitating, he sips
	the wine. Winn smiles with pleasure.

					DUKAT
			Now you.

	Winn, still smiling placidly, accepts the cup. But
	she doesn't drink it. Instead, she slowly,
	deliberately, pours the wine onto the ground.

148  ON DUKAT

	as he realizes something is very wrong. But before
	he can say a word, a wave of intense pain doubles
	him over. He tries to grab Winn's arm for support,
	but she takes a step back and Dukat falls to his
	knees. Mustering his strength, Dukat looks up
	imploringly at Winn --

					DUKAT
			Why?

	Winn stretches out her arms --

					WINN
			The Pah-wraiths demand a
			sacrifice. Someone worthy of
			them...
				(a beat)
			Who better than you?

	The Kai smiles -- we've never seen her so happy, so
	full of love and hate.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN     79.

148  CONTINUED:

	And as Dukat falls dead to the ground, the fire in
	the abyss burns brighter, lighting up the Kai's
	face.

					WINN
				(to the abyss, re:
				Dukat)
			I offer you this life as
			nourishment... to feed your
			hunger and fuel the fires that
			will set you free. Kosst
			Amojan... I am yours, now and
			forever.

	And as the Kai closes her eyes in ecstasy and awaits
	her reward, we go to --

151  INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	Kira is pacing, waiting for Odo to arrive as Garak
	stands guarding the Female Shape-shifter. Ekoor is
	by the door, holding a weapon.

151A ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	to see Odo MATERIALIZE. Kira rushes up to him.
	Because of the circumstances, Kira and Odo can't
	fully express the joy they feel at being together
	again.

					ODO
			Nerys...

					KIRA
			It's been a while.
				(sotto, re: the
				Female
				Shape-shifter)
			Watch yourself. I don't trust
			her.

					ODO
			But you trust me, don't you?

					KIRA
			Of course.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN    79A.

151A CONTINUED:

					ODO
			That's all I need to know.

	Odo approaches Garak and the Female Shape-shifter.

					GARAK
			Constable.

					ODO
			Garak.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN     80.

151A CONTINUED:	(2)

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			You're looking well, Odo.


					ODO
			Thank you for seeing me.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It's always good to see you. But
			I have no intention of
			surrendering my forces. If I
			did, it would be a sign of
			weakness... an invitation to the
			Solids to cross into the Gamma
			Quadrant and destroy the Great
			Link.

					ODO
			Believe me, I'm well aware that
			the Federation has its flaws...
			but a desire for conquest isn't
			one of them.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			And what of the Klingons and the
			Romulans... can you make the same
			claim for them?

					ODO
			The Klingon and Romulan Empires
			are in no shape to wage a war
			against anyone... besides, the
			Federation wouldn't allow it.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			The Dominion has spent the last
			two years trying to destroy the
			Federation... and now you're
			asking me to put our fate in
			their hands?

					ODO
				(simply)
			Yes.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			I can't do that, Odo. I don't
			share your faith in Solids.

					ODO
			Perhaps I can change your mind
				(holding out his
				hand)
			Link with me.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN     81.

151A CONTINUED:	(3)

					KIRA
			Odo -- what are you doing?

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
				(to Odo)
			I'm afraid I can't Link with you.
			This disease prevents me from
			changing form.

152  ON ODO

	as he steps closer to the Female Shape-shifter and
	again offers her his hand --

					ODO
			If we Link, I think I can cure
			you.

	Garak lifts his gun and points it at Odo.

					GARAK
			That's a very bad idea,
			Constable.

					KIRA
				(to Odo, re: Garak)
			He's right.

	But Odo keeps his eyes on the Female Shape-shifter.

					ODO
			Nerys -- I know what I'm doing.
				(to the Female
				Shape-shifter)
			Take my hand.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			And if you do cure me? What will
			you ask in return?

					ODO
			All I ask is that you Link with
			me.

					GARAK
			I'm warning you, Odo...

	Odo looks to Kira, silently imploring her help.
	Then after a beat --

					KIRA
			Lower your weapon, Garak.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN    81A.

152  CONTINUED:

					GARAK
				I don't think so...

	Kira steps over to Garak, and with her hand, lowers
	the barrel of his weapon.

					KIRA
			I said, put it down.

					GARAK
			Why?

					KIRA
			Because I trust Odo.

	She looks over to Odo, who smiles with gratitude.
	Odo turns back to the Female Shape-shifter, extending
	his hand once again --

153  THE FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (OPTICAL)

	looks at Odo's hand, then summons her strength to
	take hold of it. Odo MORPHS his hand around hers.

	After a few beats, the dry, desiccated flaking that
	has ravaged the Female Shape-shifter's body begins
	to disappear. The regeneration travels up her arms,
	then her body, and finally her face until she's
	completely healed.

	Only then does Odo break the Link -- as we HEAR
	their hands morphing back to their humanoid form.
	It's immediately apparent that the experience has
	profoundly changed the Female Shape-shifter.

154  ON GARAK

	keeping his weapon on the Female Shape-shifter.

					GARAK
			Move away, Constable.

					ODO
			That won't be necessary.
				(to the Female
				Shape-shifter)
			Will it?


  DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN 82-83.    

154  CONTINUED:

	The Female Shape-shifter takes a step toward Garak.


					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			If you'll step aside, I'll order
			the Jem'Hadar to cease fire.

	Garak hesitates, looking over to Kira, who nods
	reassuringly. After a beat, Garak lowers his
	weapon, allowing the Female Shape-shifter to cross
	over to a monitor and begin working its console.

					GARAK
				(re: the Female
				Shape-shifter)
			May I suggest securing her in a
			containment field.

					ODO
			Don't worry. She won't try to
			escape. She's agreed to stand
			trial for what she's done.

					KIRA
			I would've thought she'd insist
			on going back to the Gamma
			Quadrant to cure her people.

					ODO
			There's no need for that.
				(off her look)
			I'm going in her place.

					KIRA
			For how long?

					ODO
				(as gently as
				possible)
			Nerys... it's time I rejoined the
			Great Link.

	And as Kira absorbs this painful news, we:

									FADE OUT.

                           ACT EIGHT                            

	FADE IN:

155  EXT. CARDASSIA - STREET - DAY

	Rubble, smoke and fires everywhere. Buildings are
	either collapsed or burnt-out shells. Bodies litter
	the streets.

156  ANOTHER ANGLE

	to see Sisko, Martok and Ross standing amid the
	wreckage; each holding a glass of bloodwine. In his
	other hand, Martok holds the bottle of bloodwine.

					MARTOK
			This is a moment worth savoring.
				(raising his glass)
			To victory -- hard fought and
			well earned.

	Martok drains his drink, but neither Sisko nor Ross
	partake. They're too busy looking at the
	destruction that surrounds them.

					MARTOK
			Something wrong?

					SISKO
			Suddenly, I'm not thirsty.

					ROSS
			Neither am I.

157  CLOSER ON MARTOK

	as he drains his glass.

					MARTOK
			Before you waste too many
			tears... remember, those are
			Cardassians lying dead at your
			feet...
				(re: the
				devastation)
			The Bajorans would call this
			poetic justice...


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     85.

157  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			That still doesn't mean I have to
			drink a toast over their bodies.

	With that, Sisko pours his bloodwine onto the
	ground. Ross does the same, then they both EXIT,
	leaving Martok alone on the street.

	The Chancellor shrugs, "humans -- go figure." He
	then looks at the bottle of bloodwine in his hand,
	tilts it to his lips, and takes a long swallow. WE
	HOLD on Martok, looking quite contented, gazing out
	at the devastation.

158  INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	CLOSE ON a shocked Bashir.

					BASHIR
			Eight hundred million dead...

	ADJUST TO INCLUDE Garak, who's almost numb at the
	sense of loss he's experiencing.

					GARAK
			And the casualty reports are
			still coming in...
				(a beat)
			Aren't you going to congratulate
			me, doctor? My exile is
			officially over. I've returned
			home. Or rather, to what's left
			of it...

	Bashir looks to ease his friend's suffering.

					BASHIR
			I know things must look bleak to
			you right now, Garak...

					GARAK
				(dry)
			Some may say that we've gotten
			exactly what we deserve... after
			all, we're not exactly
			"innocent," are we? And I'm not
			just talking about the Bajoran
			occupation... our entire history
			is one of arrogant aggression.
			We collaborated with the
			Dominion... betrayed the Alpha
			Quadrant... there's no doubt
			about it, we're guilty as
			charged.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT    85A.

158  CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			We both know the Cardassians are
			a strong people... they'll
			survive... Cardassia will
			survive.

					GARAK
			Doctor, please -- spare me your
			insufferable Federation optimism.
			Of course it will survive... but
			not the Cardassia I knew. We had
			a rich and ancient culture -- our
			literature, music, art were
			second to none. And now, so much
			of it is lost... So many of our
			best people... our most gifted
			minds...

					BASHIR
			I'm sorry, Garak. I didn't
			mean..

					GARAK
				(collecting himself)
			Quite all right, doctor. You've
			been a good friend. I'm going to
			miss our lunches together.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     86.

158  CONTINUED:	(2)

					BASHIR
			I'm sure we'll see each other
			again.

					GARAK
			I'd like to think so. But who
			can say... we live in uncertain
			times.

	And as Garak gives Bashir one last enigmatic smile,
	we go to

159  EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing.

160  INT. WARDROOM

	The Female Shape-shifter, TWO VORTA and THREE
	JEM'HADAR FIRSTS, are seated at the table signing
	the official surrender documents. In front of them
	stand, Sisko, Ross, Martok and a Romulan dignitary.
	Among the WITNESSES filling the room, are Kira, Odo,
	Worf, Bashir, O'Brien, Ezri and various other
	STARFLEET OFFICERS, VORTA and JEM'HADAR.

	Once the Female Shape-shifter completes the signing
	of the surrender documents, she stands and hands
	them to Admiral Ross.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			The war between the Dominion and
			the Federation Alliance is now
			over.

	It's a solemn moment. Ross looks up from the
	documents and addresses the room.

					ROSS
			Four hundred years ago, a
			victorious general spoke the
			following words at the end of
			another costly war...

	And as we PAN the many silent, somber faces in the
	crowd --

					ROSS
				(continuing)
			"Today the guns are silent. A
			great tragedy has ended...


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     87.

160  CONTINUED:

					ROSS (Cont'd)
			We have known the bitterness of
			defeat and the exultation of
			triumph, and from both we have
			learned there can be no turning
			back. We must go forward to
			preserve in peace what we've won
			in war."

	There's a moment of silence.

161  NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY 160A)

	as TWO FEDERATION SECURITY GUARDS step up behind the
	Female Shape-shifter. With her usual dignity, she
	stands and heads for the door.

162  ON THE FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (FORMERLY 160B)

	as she pauses in front of Odo.

					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER
			It's up to you now, Odo.

	Odo nods. And without another word, She EXITS.

					EZRI
			Who's asking?

					SISKO (O.S.)
			Commander Worf.

	They turn to see --

165  SISKO, MARTOK, AND ROSS (FORMERLY 162A)

					SISKO
			Can you spare a moment?

					MARTOK
			We've been discussing your plans
			for the future.

					WORF
			I wasn't aware I had plans.

					ROSS
			Commander, how would you feel
			about being named Federation
			Ambassador to Kronos?

	Worf looks at the trio to see that they are serious.

					WORF
			I am not a diplomat.

					MARTOK
			And I am not a politician. But
			sometimes, fate plays cruel
			tricks on us. Come, Worf --
			Kronos needs you. And what's
			more, I need you.

	Worf turns to Ezri.

					EZRI
				(re: Martok)
			You helped him become
			Chancellor... you can't very well
			turn your back on him now.

	Worf then looks at Sisko.

					WORF
			My first loyalty is to you,
			captain.

					SISKO
			I'll probably regret this in the
			morning, but if this is something
			you want, then by all means...

					WORF
			It has been a great honor to
			serve with you, sir.

					SISKO
			The honor was all mine.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     88.

			Excellent.

	Martok embraces Worf.

					MARTOK

			chancellor won't be so bad after
			all.


	Martok breaks into a hearty LAUGH.

					EZRI
			Congratulations, Worf.

	Ezri kisses him on the cheek and gives him a
	congratulatory hug. And off of this moment ---

166  ANGLE ON KIRA AND ODO - SECOND LEVEL (FORMERLY 163)

	as they walk, deep in discussion.

					KIRA
			When will you be going?

					ODO
			Soon.

					KIRA
			You could come back, you know...
			after you've cured your people.

					ODO
			I could...

	One look at Odo tells her that's not what he has in
	mind.

					KIRA
			But you're not going to do that,
			are you?

					ODO
			Nerys...
				(searching for the words)
			You know my feelings for you will
			never change... but my people
			need me. 


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     89.

166  CONTINUED:


					ODO (Cont'd)
			They need to know what I know...
			learn what I've learned from
			living among the Solids. It's
			the only way they will ever learn
			to trust you.

					KIRA
			You don't have to justify your
			decision, Odo. There's only one
			thing I ask.

					ODO
			Name it.

					KIRA
			I want to go back with you to
			your homeworld. That way, we can
			spend your last few days as a
			Solid together.

					ODO
			I'd like that. I'd like that
			very much.

	And off this bittersweet moment --

					ODO
				(to O'Brien)
			You certainly have a lot of

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT    90A.

169  CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Too many.

					WORF
			Minsk.

					BASHIR
			Wherever you decide... I'm sure
			you and Keiko will be very happy.

	But O'Brien is already beginning to feel the pain of
	leaving his friend.

					O'BRIEN
			Look, Julian... I know that Earth
			isn't exactly around the corner,
			but I still expect you to visit
			me.

					BASHIR
			I intend to.

					O'BRIEN
			Imagine, you and me taking a
			little trip to Texas.

					BASHIR
				(nodding)
			Standing side by side in front of
			the Alamo...

					O'BRIEN
			The real Alamo.
				(re: their parting)
			You see? It's going to be great.

					BASHIR
			Absolutely. Great.

	They both nod, trying to convince each other. But
	they're not fooling anybody.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     91.

169  CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK
			I don't see what's so great about
			it. Earth's nothing more than a
			rotating ball of boredom. If you
			ask me, you'd be better off
			staying right here --
				(to Worf and Odo)
			-- and that goes for you two as
			well.

					KIRA
			Don't tell me you're getting
			sentimental, Quark...

					QUARK
			Me? Not a chance. I just don't
			like change, that's all.

					SISKO
			Well you better get used to it,
			because things are going to be
			pretty different around here.


	For a moment, that gives everyone pause.

169A SISKO (FORMERLY 172)

	lifts his glass to his crew.

					SISKO
			To the best crew any captain ever
			had.

	They all lift their glasses.

					SISKO
			This may be the last night that
			we're all together, but no matter
			what the future holds, no matter
			how far we travel, a part of us --
			a very important part -- will
			always remain here... on Deep
			Space Nine.

	And with that thought in mind, everyone CLINKS
	glasses.

					VIC (O.S.)
			Ladies and gentlemen --


  DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 92-93.    

170  ANGLE ON THE STAGE (FORMERLY 173)

	to see Vic standing in front of the band.

					VIC
			This is a very special night for
			some friends of mine. They've
			been together a long time. But
			like the man said, nothing lasts
			forever. So... 
				(to the group)
			Gang -- this one's from the heart.

	And with that, Vic launches into "The Way You Look
	Tonight." It's an upbeat tune, but the lyrics carry
	with them a touch of melancholy. And as we pan
	across their faces, we see that the sentiment isn't
	lost on our heroes.

170A ON VIC

	as he finishes the song.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     94.

171  AND THE GROUP

	sharing a last moment of togetherness. And off
	this, we go to --

172  OMITTED

173  INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVERN (FORMERLY 164)

	CLOSE ON Dukat's lifeless body. Off-screen, we hear
	Winn continue to chant -- only now, her voice cracks
	from exhaustion.

					WINN (O.S.)
			Dorra tolka bre-tri pah-wran...

	ADJUST TO REVEAL Kai Winn looking sweaty,
	disheveled, and half-insane.

					WINN
				(continuing)
			Dorra tolka o-chen... Dorra tolka
			wey-sah shay-hal...

174  ANGLE ON THE ABYSS (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 165)

	as the FIRES transform into ENERGY PATTERNS that
	SWIRL overhead.

175  WINN (FORMERLY 166)

	sees this and her eyes light up with new hope.

					WINN
			Ko'se nusso ma'kora kajani... 
			preen dah-ono uka'lamor-eye anu --
				(ecstatic)
			Kosst Amojan -- I await you!
			Come to me!


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     95.

176  ON THE ENERGY PATTERN (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 167)

	as it gathers intensity. Suddenly, an ENERGY SPEAR
	is released, striking Kai Winn in the chest and
	flinging her against the rocks.

177  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 168)

	as a different-looking ENERGY PATTERN plunges into
	Dukat's open mouth.

178  CLOSE ON DUKAT'S EYES (FORMERLY 169)

	as they pop open, revealing the red-pupils of a Pah-
	wraith.

179  ANGLE ON KAI WINN

	coming to consciousness. She looks over toward
	Dukat --

					WINN
			No...

180  ON DUKAT (FORMERLY 181)

	as he staggers to his feet. He's been transformed
	back into a Cardassian and he seems enormously
	pleased to be his old self again. He then looks
	over to Winn, who's staring at him with disgust and
	fear. Dukat smiles at her victoriously.

									CUT TO:

181  INT. VIC'S LOUNGE (FORMERLY 182)

	CLOSE ON Sisko dancing with Kasidy. Suddenly, he 
	stops moving, a look of concern clouds his face.

					KASIDY
			Ben - what's wrong?

	A shaken Sisko takes a moment to clear his head.

					SISKO
			I understand now...

					KASIDY
			Understand what?


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     96.

181  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			What I have to do. What I was
			meant to do.
				(a beat)
			Kas -- I have to go...

					KASIDY
				(worried)
			Go? Where?

					SISKO
			To Bajor. To the fire caves.

					KASIDY
			I'll go with you.

					SISKO
			No...

182  CLOSE ON SISKO

	as he looks over to the bar --

183  SISKO'S POV

	of Kira, Odo, Worf, Quark, O'Brien, Bashir, Ezri...
	all of them having a good time.

184  BACK TO SISKO

	as he looks at Kasidy.

					SISKO
			I have to do this alone.

	And with a last look at Kasidy, Sisko EXITS. We
	HOLD on Kasidy looking after him.

185  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)(STOCK) (FORMERLY 183)

	To see a Runabout orbiting Bajor.

186  INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES (FORMERLY 184)

	Sisko makes his way cautiously through the smoky
	caverns, illuminating his way with the palm beacon
	attached to his phaser rifle.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     97.

187  ON SISKO (FORMERLY 185)

	as he enters another cavern, a voice calls out to
	him --

					JAKE (O.S.)
			Dad...

	Sisko turns to find --

188  JAKE (FORMERLY 186)

	standing among the rocks.

					SISKO
			Jake?

					JAKE
			You've got to come back to the
			station with me.

					SISKO
			How'd you get here?

					JAKE
			It doesn't matter. If you stay
			here, you'll die.

					KASIDY (O.S.)
			He's right, Ben.

	Sisko looks around to see --

189  KASIDY (FORMERLY 187)

	standing at the other side of the cavern wall.

					KASIDY
			Our baby's going to need a
			father.

	Sisko looks to Kasidy, then back to Jake.

					SISKO
			You're not real -- neither one of
			you...

					KASIDY
			But what we're saying is real.

					JAKE
			If you try to stop the
			Restoration, you'll be killed.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     98.

189  CONTINUED:

					KASIDY
			You can't defeat the Kosst
			Amojan. They're too powerful...

					JAKE
			Come home, Dad -- you don't
			belong here. It's not your
			fight.

					SISKO
			I know what you're doing...

					KASIDY
			We're trying to help you.

					SISKO
			No, you're trying to make me
			doubt myself...
				(taking a breath)
			I won't let you.

	Sisko turns his back on them and resumes his trek.

					JAKE
			Dad... please!

					KASIDY
		Ben... don't.

	But Sisko walks on, ignoring their pleas.

190  INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVERN
	(FORMERLY 188) (OPTICAL)

	The Dukat Pah-wraith stands over Kai Winn, who's
	still too weak to get to her feet. The book of the
	Kosst Amojan lies discarded beside her.

					DUKAT
			Did you really think the Pah-
			wraiths would choose you to be
			their Emissary?

	Dukat points to the ENERGY TENDRILS swirling over
	the abyss.

					DUKAT
				(dripping with
				contempt)
			Soon the Pah-wraiths will burn
			across Bajor, the Celestial
			Temple, the Alpha Quadrant... Can
			you picture it?


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT    98A.

190  CONTINUED:

					DUKAT (Cont'd)
			A universe in flames, burning
			brightly for all eternity.

	Suddenly, Dukat smiles to himself, aware of a new
	presence in the cavern.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT     99.

190  CONTINUED:	(2)

					DUKAT
			The Prophets have sent me a gift.

	And with that, he turns to look at --

191  SISKO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 189)

	standing in the cavern beneath them.

					DUKAT
			Their beloved Emissary... sent
			forth like an avenging angel to
			slay the demon.

					SISKO
			I should've known the demon would
			be you.

	Dukat raises his arms --

					DUKAT
			Go on -- kill me if you can.

	Sisko raises his rifle, but before he can take aim,
	an unseen force yanks the weapon out of his hand and
	flings it against the rocks.

					DUKAT
			Come now, captain... you'll have
			to do better than that.

192  DUKAT (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 190)

	stretches out his hand, discharging an invisible
	ENERGY BOLT which knocks Sisko to the ground.

					DUKAT
			This is too easy.

193  SISKO (FORMERLY 191)


	shakes the cobwebs and gets to his feet. Then
	mustering his strength, Sisko climbs the rock steps
	to the ledge where Dukat stands.

					DUKAT
			That's right. Come closer.

	Sisko reaches the ledge. Then using both hands as a
	club, he pummels at Dukat -- but his blows have no
	effect.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT    100.

193  CONTINUED:

					DUKAT
			Satisfied?
				(smiling)
			Now bow to me.

	But Sisko just glares at him.

					DUKAT
			I said bow --

	And suddenly, a force drives Sisko to his knees.
	But Sisko refuses to cower.

					SISKO
			You're pathetic.

					DUKAT
			Am I? Then why are you the one
			on your knees?

					SISKO
			First the Dominion... now the 
			Pah-wraiths... you have a talent 
			for picking the losing side.

	Dukat stretches out his hand again, doubling Sisko
	over in pain.

					DUKAT
			Benjamin... please. We've known
			each other too long. And since
			this is the last time we'll ever
			be together -- let's try to speak
			honestly.
				(a beat)
			In the past, we've both had our
			share of victories and defeats...
			but now it's time to resolve our
			differences and face the ultimate
			truth -- I've won, and you've
			lost.

					SISKO
				(persisting)
			The Pah-wraiths aren't going to
			conquer anything. Not Bajor.
			Not the Celestial Temple. And
			certainly not the Alpha Quadrant.

					DUKAT
			And who's going to stop us?

					SISKO
			I am.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT    101.

193  CONTINUED:	(2)

					DUKAT
			You?
				(laughing)
			You can't even stand up.

					WINN (O.S.)
			Then I'll stop you --

	They turn to see --

194  KAI WINN (FORMERLY 192)

	standing at the edge of the abyss, holding the text
	of the Kosst Amojan. She rears back to toss the
	book into the fiery abyss, but before she can --

195  DUKAT (FORMERLY 193)

	raises his hand and the book is plucked out of her
	hand and flies into his.

					DUKAT
				(to Winn)
			Are you still here?

196  ON WINN (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 194) 

	turning to Sisko --

					WINN
			Emissary, the book... 

	But before she can finish, an ENERGY TENDRIL snakes
	out of the abyss, wraps itself around her and bursts
	into flames, consuming her in seconds.

197  ON DUKAT (FORMERLY 195)

	clutching the book and smiling contentedly at Winn's fate.

					DUKAT
			Farewell, Adami.

	And as he turns back toward Sisko --

198  SISKO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 196)

	launches himself at Dukat, tackling him around the
	waist, and sending them both hurtling over the ledge
	and into the abyss.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT    102.

199  ON THE ABYSS (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 197)

	as Sisko, Dukat and the text of the Kosst Amojan
	plummet down into the infinite depths of the flaming
	caverns. And as their tumbling bodies fall, a
	bright FLASH of light WHITES OUT the screen --

200  INT. WHITE LIMBO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 198)

	Sisko looks around, trying to get his bearings. His
	HEARTBEAT and BREATHING are magnified.

					SISKO
			Sarah? Are you here? What
			happened?

	ADJUST to include Sarah/Prophet.

					SARAH PROPHET
			The Emissary has completed his
			task.

					SISKO
			But the Pah-wraiths...

					SARAH PROPHET
			You've returned them to their
			prison within the fire caves.

					SISKO
			The book was the key, wasn't it?

					SARAH PROPHET
			To a door that can never be
			opened again.

					SISKO
			And Dukat? Is he dead?

					SARAH PROPHET
			He's where he belongs... with the
			Pah-wraiths.
				(with a smile)
			Your time of trial has ended.
			You need to rest now.

					SISKO
			I intend to. As soon as I get
			back to Deep Space Nine.

			That won't be necessary...

	Just then, SEVERAL FIGURES emerge from the mists
	behind Sarah. They are other Prophets, taking the
	form of Kira, Worf, Odo, Bashir, Ezri, Martok and
	Ross.

					SARAH PROPHET
			You're with us now.

201  CLOSE ON SISKO (FORMERLY 199)

	as the meaning of her words sink in. And we:

	FADE IN:

202  INT. WARDROOM

	Where Kasidy, Jake, Odo, Worf, Bashir and Ezri are
	gathered around the table.

					EZRI
			We found the captain's runabout
			orbiting Bajor.

					WORF
				(to Kasidy)
			But when we scanned the fire
			caves, there was no sign of him.

	Bashir comes over with a cup of tea for Kasidy.

					BASHIR
			Here. Tarkalian tea -- very
			soothing.

					EZRI
				(sotto, to Bashir)
			Better keep it coming.

					JAKE
			You're not calling off the search
			yet, are you?

					ODO
			Not until we find your father.

					JAKE
			What about Kendra Province, where
			he bought that land. Maybe he
			went there for some reason...

					WORF
			Colonel Kira and Chief O'Brien
			have just completed another scan
			of the planet. As far as they
			can tell, he's not there.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    105.

203  ANGLE ON KASIDY (OPTICAL)

	She finally speaks, voicing the dread building
	inside her.

					KASIDY
			Something's happened to Ben.
			Something bad... I can feel it.
			The Prophets warned us.

	And as she looks at Jake, the screen WHITES OUT --

204  INT. WHITE LIMBO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 209)

	Kasidy, somewhat frightened and bewildered, looks
	around trying to get her bearings.

					KASIDY
			Hello? Is anyone here?

	We HEAR her magnified heartbeat and breathing. Then
	the sound of a VOICE, softly whispering her name in
	the wind.

					KASIDY
			Ben? Is that you?

					SISKO (O.S.)
			Kasidy.

	Kasidy turns to see Sisko, standing behind her. The
	moment she sees her husband, she rushes into his
	arms.

					KASIDY
			Ben! I was so worried...
				(looking around at
				the whiteness
				surrounding them)
			Where are we?

					SISKO
			The Celestial Temple.

	She steps away to get a better look at him.


 DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 106-106A.   

204  CONTINUED:

					KASIDY
			This is scaring me -- let's go
			home.

					SISKO
			I can't. Not now.

					KASIDY
			Why not?

	Kasidy can see that Sisko doesn't have an easy
	answer to that question.

					KASIDY
			Oh, God... this is it, isn't it?
			The sorrow the Prophets warned us
			about...

					SISKO
			It's difficult to explain... it
			isn't linear...

					KASIDY
			What isn't?

					SISKO
			My life... my destiny... the
			Prophets saved me, Kas -- I'm
			their Emissary, and they still
			have a great deal for me to do.
			But first, there's a lot I have
			to learn... things only the
			Prophets can teach me.

					KASIDY
			When will you be back?

					SISKO
			It's hard to say. Time doesn't
			exist here. It could be a year.
			It could be yesterday.
				(definitively)
			But I will be back.

	Kasidy finds reassurance in Sisko's eyes.

					KASIDY
			I'll be waiting.

	Sisko takes Kasidy in his arms and kisses her. And
	as they hold each other tight, the screen WHITES OUT
	again --

	others look on with concern as well.

					JAKE
			You seemed pretty far away for a

					KASIDY
			I was talking to your father.

207  INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS (FORMERLY 211R)

	As we hear an ORCHESTRAL VERSION of "The Way You
	Look Tonight," we find O'Brien -- a few BAGS slung
	over his shoulder -- shooing Molly out the door to
	join his off-screen family. He takes a last look
	around the now empty room, making sure they didn't
	leave anything behind.

	His eye snags on something on the ground and he
	reaches down to pick up a FIGURINE from his Alamo
	Model -- it's Colonel Travis. He smiles, and we --

	featuring the history of their romance.

									CUT TO:

213  INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	Jake's sitting quietly looking at the model of the

217  INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR

	Bashir and O'Brien are standing there, unable to say
	good-bye. A moment as the two regard each other,
	realizing that words could never do justice to their
	friendship. They extend their hands to shake, a
	beat, then they pull each other into a bear-hug.

									CUT TO:

218  INT. PROMENADE

	Worf, carrying a bag and a bat'leth strapped over
	his shoulder, walks with Martok toward the airlock.
	Martok is talking enthusiastically about the future
	of the Klingon Empire (of course, we don't hear any
	of this -- only the musical score is playing). But
	a somber Worf has other things on his mind at the
	moment.

	Martok steps through the airlock door, but Worf
	hesitates on the steps, taking a moment to have one
	last look at the station that's come to mean so much
	to him. Scanning the area, he looks up to see --

219  WORF'S POV OF EZRI

	standing on the second level, watching him leave.
	After a beat, she lifts her hand in farewell.

220  ON WORF

	as he returns the gesture. A beat later, he
	disappears into the airlock.

221  INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	Jake, sitting on the couch, places the roof onto the

					ODO
			Quite sure. I'm not very good at

					KIRA
			A lot of people are going to be

					ODO
			If they don't know how I feel

			words won't make any difference.

	Just as they reach the airlock, a voice calls out to
	them --

					QUARK (O.S.)
			I knew it!

	They turn to see Quark hurrying over to them.

					QUARK
			When I saw the two of you slip
			out of the holosuite, I said to
			myself, "That no-good,
			misanthropic, cantankerous,
			changeling is trying to sneak off

					ODO
			That was the idea.

					QUARK
			Well, it's not going to happen.

			Apparently not.

					QUARK
			So now that I'm here... isn't
			there something you want to say
			to me?

					ODO
			Such as?

					QUARK
			Such as, "Good-bye, you certainly
			were a worthy adversary" -- or
			maybe something with the words
			"mutual respect" in it...

					ODO
			No.

					QUARK
			No? What do you mean "no?"


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    112.

226  CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			There's nothing I want to say to
			you.

					QUARK
			You're telling me that after all
			these years... after all we've
			been through, you're not even
			going to say good-bye to me?

					ODO
			That's right.

	Odo and Quark stare each other down for a long beat.
	Finally, Odo looks to Kira --

					ODO
			Nerys... I'll be on the Runabout.

	And with a final dismissive glance at Quark, Odo
	steps around him and into the airlock.

227  ON QUARK AND KIRA (FORMERLY 176)

	watching him disappear into the runabout.

					QUARK
			I guess that's it then...

					KIRA
			Don't take it so hard, Quark --

					QUARK
			Hard? What are you talking about?
				(breaking into a smile)
			That man loves me -- couldn't you
			see? It was written all over his
			back.

	And with that, Quark heads back down the corridor.
	And as Kira follows Odo into the runabout, we go to:

228  EXT. ATOLL - DAY (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 200)

	Kira and Odo are standing on a small outcropping of
	rock, surrounded by a vast ocean of Shape-shifters in
	their gelatinous state. We're on the Dominion
	homeworld -- the changeling planet we saw in "Broken
	Link." However, this time, the Shape-shifter ocean
	is discolored -- evidence of the illness that's
	affecting the Great Link.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    113.

228  CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			The Link... it looks different.

					ODO
			They're dying.

					KIRA
			You should go to them.

	Odo nods, but he has something to say to her first.

					ODO
			Nerys, tell the captain... and
			the others... I'm going to miss
			them.

					KIRA
				(half-smiling)
			Even Quark?

					ODO
			Even Quark.
				(looking into her
				eyes)
			But most of all...

	She holds up her hand to stop him.

					KIRA
			I know.

	They kiss. It's a long, passionate embrace.
	Whatever they have to say to each other, they're
	saying it right now. Finally, they break the
	embrace.

229  ANGLE ON ODO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 201)

	as he MORPHS his clothes into a tuxedo.

					KIRA
			What's that for?

					ODO
			You always said I looked good in
			a tuxedo.

					KIRA
			You do.

					ODO
			Then that's how I want you to
			remember me...


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    114.

229  CONTINUED:

	Kira can't help smiling as she straightens his bow
	tie.

					KIRA
			I'll remember this moment
			forever.
				(a beat)
			I'll remember all our moments...

					ODO
			As will I.

	They stare at each other a beat.

					ODO
			Good-bye, Nerys.

230  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 202)

	as Odo turns away and walks calmly into the sea of
	changelings. He turns back to look at Kira one last
	time.

231  CLOSER ON ODO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 203)

	as he raises his hand in farewell.

232  KIRA (FORMERLY 204)

	raises her hand in response.

233  ODO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 205)

	then MORPHS into his gelatinous state. As he does,
	the goo around him begins to softly ripple and
	change colors, regaining its healthy golden glow.

234  ON KIRA (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 206)

	standing alone on the atoll, surrounded by the vast
	undulating changeling sea.

									CUT TO:

235  INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE (FORMERLY 212)

	The dawning of a new day. CLOSE ON Nog ENTERING
	with a PADD.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    115.

235  CONTINUED:

					NOG
			Today's duty roster, colonel.

	ADJUST ANGLE to REVEAL Kira sitting in the Captain's
	Chair. Nog hands her the PADD, which she glances at.

					KIRA
			Nice work.
				(then looking up)
			And congratulations on your
			promotion, lieutenant.

					NOG
				(grinning)
			Thank you, sir. I guess putting me
			in for promotion was one of Captain
			Sisko's last official acts.

					KIRA
			I'm sure he's very proud of you, Nog.

					NOG
			I'd like to think so, sir.

					KIRA
			Now about the cargo inventories...

					NOG
			I'll get right on it.

	And with that, Nog EXITS. We HOLD on Kira as she
	gets up from behind the desk, picks up Sisko's
	baseball and EXITS into --

236  INT. OPS (FORMERLY 213)

	where she stands at the head of the stairs, tossing
	the baseball. Kira looks around the room --

237  KIRA'S POV - OF ALL THE NEW FACES (FORMERLY 214) 

	manning the stations.

238  ON KIRA (FORMERLY 215)

	as she glances at the baseball, thinking about
	Captain Sisko. After a beat, she smiles.

									CUT TO:


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    116.

239  INT. PROMENADE (FORMERLY 216)

	Bashir and Ezri are walking down the Promenade.

					BASHIR
			... the thing of it is, I thought
			the cardiac apoptosis would lead
			to terminal coronary failure, but
			in actuality -- and here's the
			really interesting part -- the
			apoptosis was part of the normal
			cardiac renewal process.

	Bashir ends with a self-satisfied nod.

					BASHIR
			What do you think?

					EZRI
			I think maybe tonight, after
			dinner, we could go to Quark's...
			spend some time in a holosuite.

					BASHIR
			I wouldn't mind a little trip to
			Vegas... 

					EZRI
			Actually, I was thinking about
			the Alamo.

					BASHIR
			We can't go there.

					EZRI
			Why not?

					BASHIR
			That was something Miles and I
			did.
				(brightening)
			But we could try a new program I
			got... The Battle of
			Thermopylae.
				(off her blank look)
			You know, where a small band of
			Spartans led by King Leonidas
			defended a mountain pass against
			the vast Persian army.

					EZRI
			What happened then?

					BASHIR
			For two days, the Spartans put up
			a heroic struggle.


   
   DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 116A.     

239  CONTINUED:

					EZRI
			Until they were wiped out.

					BASHIR
			How'd you know?

					EZRI
			Lucky guess. I take it we'll be
			the Spartans?

					BASHIR
			Fighting to the last man.


  DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE     117    

239  CONTINUED:	(2)

					EZRI
			Just like the Alamo.

					BASHIR
			Exactly.

	Ezri looks at him for a beat.

					EZRI
			Have you ever talked to a
			counselor about these
			annihilation fantasies?

					BASHIR
			You think I should?

					EZRI
			I'll set up a session for
			tomorrow.

					BASHIR
			But tonight...

					EZRI
			Tonight we defend the pass.

	Bashir smiles; this is love. And this moment leads
	us to --

240  INT. QUARK'S (FORMERLY 217)

	The usual midday crowd. Quark places a small vial
	in front of Morn.

					QUARK
			That'll be ten strips of latinum.

	Morn is about to say something --

					QUARK
			I know, I know -- I'll put it on
			your tab.

	Morn then picks up the bottle and studies it
	carefully.

					QUARK
			Don't worry, it's guaranteed to
			grow hair within a week. Though
			if you ask me, that dome of yours
			is hairy enough. Besides, hasn't
			there been enough change around
			here already?


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    118.

240  CONTINUED:

					KIRA (O.S.)
			Quark!

	He turns to see --

241  AN ANGRY KIRA (FORMERLY 218)

	approaching, holding a PADD.

					KIRA
			You mind explaining this?

	Looking at the PADD.

					QUARK
			That's this week's betting
			pool...

					KIRA
			You're taking bets on who's going
			to be the new Kai?

					QUARK
			It's a wide open field. Just
			between you and me, the smart
			money's on Vedek Ungtae.

					KIRA
			Well just between you and me --
			all bets are off.

					QUARK
			What are you talking about?

					KIRA
			As of this moment, betting pools
			of any kind are illegal on this
			station. I catch someone placing
			a bet, and you'll spend fifteen
			days in a holding cell. Is that
			clear?

					QUARK
				(dry)
			Fifteen days... can I bring my
			own pillow?

					KIRA
			Quark!


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    119.

241  CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			It's clear, it's clear.

					KIRA
			It better be.

	And without another word, Kira EXITS. We HOLD on
	Quark and Morn.

					QUARK
			It's like I said, the more things
			change, the more they stay the
			same.

	And as Quark goes back to work --

242  INT. PROMENADE (FORMERLY 219)

	to see Kira walk down the busy Promenade. The
	CAMERA slowly RISES above the crowd and PANS OVER to
	find --

243  A SOMBER JAKE (FORMERLY 220)

	standing on the second level of the Promenade,
	looking out one of the windows.

244  JAKE'S POV -- OF THE WORMHOLE (OPTICAL) 
	(FORMERLY 221)

	which suddenly BURSTS OPEN, allowing a ship to
	enter. Like always, it's a magical sight.

245  CLOSE ON JAKE (FORMERLY 222)

	thinking about how much he misses his father. A
	hand COMES INTO FRAME and lightly grips his
	shoulder. WE WIDEN TO REVEAL --

246  KIRA (FORMERLY 223)

	standing beside him. She knows what he's feeling
	and wants him to know he's not alone. They exchange
	a brief smile, then gaze back out the window...


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE    120.

247  EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) 
	(FORMERLY 224)

	Looking in on Jake and Kira, standing by the window.
	The CAMERA SLOWLY begins to pull back, past the
	usual station shot and continuing further and
	further away... the station becoming smaller and
	smaller and smaller still... until finally, Deep
	Space Nine becomes just one more bright, but distant
	star in the vast, cathedral of space.

									FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT NINE                         
                            THE END
