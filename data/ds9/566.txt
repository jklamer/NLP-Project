VIC'S LOUNGE - NIGHT	CLOSE ON a coonskin cap being held in Vic's hand.					VIC (O.S.)			Sure I remember the Alamo.	ADJUST to include VIC, O'BRIEN and BASHIR seated at	one of the front tables. Other than Vic's band,	which is idly killing time on stage, there's no one	else in the joint.					BASHIR				(to O'Brien)			I told you he would.					VIC			Laurence Harvey, Richard Widmark			and John Wayne as Davy Crockett.			Great battle scenes, nice sets,			but way too long.					O'BRIEN			We're not talking about a movie.					BASHIR			We're talking about our holosuite			program.					VIC			Oh, that Alamo. What about it?					BASHIR			We've got Holosuite Four reserved			for an hour and we thought maybe			you'd like to join us.					VIC			Look fellas, I'm touched by the			offer, but I don't know...					O'BRIEN			We could transfer your matrix			into the Alamo program.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing... " - REV. 01/13/99 - TEASER    2-3.1    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			You've got to get out of Vegas			every once in a while, right?					VIC			True, but I'm afraid I've gotta			say no.					BASHIR			Why?	Vic studies the coonskin cap.					VIC			I don't look good in buckskin.	Bashir and O'Brien exchange a look of	disappointment.					VIC			I'll tell you what I'll do			though...	Vic gets to his feet, tossing the coonskin hat onto	the table.					VIC			How about a little tune to get			you into a Texas state of mind.	And with that, Vic steps onto the stage and launches	into a romantic song about the Alamo.2    ANGLE ON O'BRIEN AND BASHIR	enjoying this tribute to their obsession.3    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	the song plays out for a stanza or two, when	suddenly, there's a momentary disruption -- a kind	of ELECTRONIC GLITCH in the Holosuite. The lounge	seems to lose it's physical stability, albeit for no	more than a few seconds.	When everything is finally stabilized, Bashir and	O'Brien find themselves in a slightly different-	looking lounge. It's darker, smokier, and there's a	sweaty, noisy crowd, mostly made up of tough-looking	guys wearing cheap suits. And the broads that are	with them ain't exactly expensive either.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing... " - REV. 01/13/99 - TEASER     3A.3    CONTINUED:	And though Vic is still trying to complete his Alamo	tune, the music accompanying him is brassy, loud,	and vulgar. We hear AD HOC shouts from the crowd of	"Bring on the broads," "Lose the singer," and "Where	are the girls?"4    CLOSER ON O'BRIEN AND BASHIR	surprised by the sudden turn of events.5    ANGLE ON THE STAGE	as a line of scantily clad SHOWGIRLS emerge from	offstage to the joyful howls and catcalls of the	unruly crowd. The showgirls crowd a bewildered Vic,	forcing him offstage.					VIC			What the hell -- ?6    ANOTHER ANGLE	as O'Brien and Bashir get out of their seats to meet	him.					BASHIR			What's all this?					VIC			Don't ask me.					O'BRIEN			Maybe there's a pointer fault in			the holosuite parameter's file...					MALE VOICE (O.S.)			Well look who's here...	They turn to see --7    ANGLE ON THE DOOR	where a beefy-looking hard case named FRANKIE EYES	stands beside an even more imposing bodyguard, TONY	CICCI (pronounced Cheech).     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing... " - REV. 01/13/99 - TEASER      4.7    CONTINUED:					FRANKIE				(re: Vic)			The pretty boy singer himself.					VIC				(guarded)			Frankie Eyes... what are you			doing in Vegas?					FRANKIE			What happened to "Hello, Frankie,			long time no see. Make yourself			at home. Can I get you			anything?"				(to Cicci)			You believe this guy?					CICCI				(stone-faced)			No manners.					FRANKIE				(to Vic)			Were you born in a barn or			something?					BASHIR				(to Vic, re:				Frankie)			Is this gentleman a friend of			yours?					VIC				(revealing nothing)			We know each other.					FRANKIE			We're a long way from South			Philly, ain't we Vic?					VIC			You here on business or pleasure?					FRANKIE			Let's just say I'm here to stay.			While you, Vicky-boy, are about			to take a powder.					VIC			I'm not going anywhere.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing... " - REV. 01/13/99 - TEASER      5.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					FRANKIE			I got news for you, pal. I just			bought this hotel. You're			history.					VIC				(taken aback)			You can't fire me. I have a			contract.					FRANKIE			And you can paper your walls with			it. You're finished in this			town, Vic.					VIC			You're blackballing me?					FRANKIE			As of this moment, you couldn't			get a job as a singing busboy.				(a beat)			Now are you gonna walk out of			here, or do you have to be carried			out? Makes no difference to me.	O'Brien's had enough of Frankie's attitude.					O'BRIEN				(to Vic)			Let me handle this.				(to Com)			Computer. Delete characters			Frankie Eyes and --				(to Cicci)			I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.					CICCI			Cicci.					O'BRIEN				(to Com)			And Cicci from this holosuite program.	O'Brien crosses his arms in satisfaction, expecting	Frankie and Cicci to disappear any moment. But they	don't.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing...

There must be a little			problem with the character			deletion algorithm.				(to Com)			Computer, freeze program.	Still nothing happens.

VIC'S LOUNGE - NIGHT	Moments later. All eyes are on Vic.					FRANKIE			What's it going to be, "pallie?"					VIC			I guess I start packing.	Frankie smiles, nods to Cicci, who lets Vic go.	Frankie then pats Vic on the cheek.					FRANKIE			Smart boy.				(to Cicci)			Now let's go check out my casino.	And with that, Frankie and Cicci EXIT into the	casino area.9    WE HOLD ON	Vic, O'Brien and Bashir.					BASHIR				(O'Brien)			What do we do now?					VIC			Nothing we can do. Frankie's a			made man. Capice?					BASHIR				(to Vic, re: Bashir)			I'm not just talking about			Frankie, I'm talking about fixing			the entire program.					O'BRIEN			I suppose we could shut it down			manually and reset it.  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing... " - REV. 01/13/99 - ACT ONE 7A-8.     9    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)			But that would mean wiping Vic's			memory. He'd forget everything			that's happened since we first			activated him.					VIC			Hold on, pallie. No one's wiping			my memory.					BASHIR			Of course not. There has to be			another way.					O'BRIEN			I just wish I knew what it was.					BASHIR			Maybe I better talk to my friend,			Felix. After all, he designed			this program.					VIC			You do that.					O'BRIEN			In the meantime, you'd better			stay clear of Frankie Eyes.					VIC			You'll get no argument from me.	O'Brien and Bashir remain skeptical, but Vic is	determined to control his own destiny.10   INT. OPS	CLOSE ON an angry NOG.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing... " - REV. 01/13/99 - ACT ONE      9.10   CONTINUED:					NOG			I'll tell you one thing, if this			Frankie Eyes hurts Vic in any			way, he's going to have to answer			to me.	ADJUST to include O'Brien, KIRA, and WORF, at their	posts.					WORF			I don't understand how you can			feel such loyalty to a hologram.					NOG			He's not just a hologram, he's my			friend.					O'BRIEN				(to Worf)			Don't you like Vic?					WORF			As a singer, I find him...			entertaining. But beyond that, I			neither like him nor dislike him.			He's a hologram. And therefore,			does not exist.	With that, Worf heads for the turbolift.					KIRA			He does to me.10A  ANGLE ON THE TURBOLIFT	as it arrives with Bashir as its passenger. Bashir	gets off and Worf takes his place, EXITING. Bashir	approaches the group.					BASHIR			I spoke to Felix. I know what's			affecting Vic's program. It's a			jack-in-the-box.					NOG			A what?					O'BRIEN			A jack-in-the-box. It's a			children's toy, on Earth. You			wind it up and a figure jumps out			and goes "Boo!"     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing... " - REV. 01/13/99 - ACT ONE     9A.10A  CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Except this type of jack-in-the-			box is different.					NOG			It doesn't go "Boo?"					BASHIR			No, this surprise is buried deep			in the holosuite program.					O'BRIEN			It's meant to shake things up,			keep things interesting...					NOG			I wasn't bored.				(to Kira)			Were you?					KIRA			Not a bit. I liked Vic's just			the way it was.					BASHIR			According to Felix, if we get rid			of Frankie Eyes, everything			resets to the way it was.					KIRA				(seeing some hope)			That's good to know.					NOG			So how do we get rid of Frankie			Eyes?					BASHIR			That's up to us. But Felix			warned me that the program is			period specific.					O'BRIEN			In other words, if we have to			shoot him, we have to do it with			a forty-five automatic and not a			phaser.					BASHIR			We can't shoot Frankie, it's too			dangerous.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Badda-bing...
