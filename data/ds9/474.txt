                       "The Way of the Warrior"                        
                            TEASER                              

	FADE IN:

1    INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	We start off close on SISKO and KIRA, both carrying the
	modified phaser rifles used in "The Adversary." They're
	in motion, hurrying down a corridor, looking grim and
	focused. Whatever's up, it's serious business.

	They reach a doorway and flatten themselves against the
	bulkhead, one on each side of the door, SWAT team 
	style. Sisko nods to Kira, holds up his hand, and 
	counts down three-two-one with his fingers. As his 
	hand closes into a fist, Kira hits the com-panel with 
	her palm, the door opens, and they both swing into the 
	doorway and aim their rifles.

2    INT. GUEST QUARTERS (OPTICAL)

	As they ENTER, Sisko fires his phaser rifle, 
	Which gives off an expanding burst of energy (as in "The 
	Adversary"), washing over the room.

	They both wait for a beat. Whatever they're hunting 
	isn't there. Their combadges CHIRP.

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE
			O'Brien to Sisko.

					SISKO
			Go ahead.

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE
			We've swept all of Level 
			Seventeen. No sign of the 
			changeling.

					SISKO
			Move down to Eighteen. We'll meet 
			you there after we finish checking 
			the guest quarters.

					KIRA
			Just watch yourself, Chief. This 
			changeling knows the station as
			well as we do. He could be 
			anywhere... or anything.

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE 
			Aye, Major.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER         2.

 2   CONTINUED:

	Sisko and Kira EXIT the room and move to the next guest 
	quarters.

3   INT. GUEST QUARTERS - BEDROOM (OPTICAL)

	Sisko and Kira ENTER, but before they can set
	themselves to fire, A CHAIR in the room suddenly
	SHAPE-SHIFTS into a jet of protoplasmic goo. The goo
	quickly arcs toward the door, changing in mid-flight
	into a bird, which flies away.

	He's go before Sisko or Kira can get off a shot.

					SISKO
				(hits combadge)
			We found him. He's headed for the Promenade.

									CUT TO:

4   INT. PROMENADE

	Two-person security teams, armed with phaser rifles, 
	run along either side of the upper level of the 
	Promenade.

4A   NEW ANGLE

	Down below, BASHIR, also armed with a rifle, takes 
	cover behind the shop directory.

4B   CLOSE ON BASHIR

	Who's been promoted to full lieutenant.

					BASHIR
				(to com)
			All right, I want phaser sweeps of 
			everything in the Promenade. He's
			here somewhere. Let's find him.
				(a beat)
			On three. One, two...

	Just then, an arm reaches from behind Bashir and grabs
	him by the shoulder. As a startled Bashir turns 
	around, we hear the sound of a morph.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER         3.

5   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	We see the tail end of a morph as ODO separates himself 
	from the shop directory. Just then, O'BRIEN steps up 
	behind Odo and aims his phaser rifle at the constable.

					O'BRIEN 
			Bang. You're dead.

					ODO 
			And so is Doctor Bashir.

	Just then, Sisko and Kira ENTER the Promenade. They 
	join Bashir, O'Brien and Odo, as do several security 
	officers.

					KIRA
				(to com) 
			Computer, elapsed time?

					COMPUTER VOICE 
			Three hours, twenty-seven minutes.

					ODO 
			That's not good enough. If one of 
			my people were loose on the 
			station for that long, there's no 
			telling what damage he could do.

					SISKO
				(to Kira) 
			Schedule another surprise drill. 
			If the Dominion tries to infiltrate 
			the station, I want to 
			be ready for them.

					ODO
				(re: Bashir) 
			And remind everyone that next 
			time, they'd better sweep 
			everything. A changeling can be 
			anything. A post, a pillar...
				(patting the directory) 
			Even a patch of reflective surfacing.

					O'BRIEN
				(chagrinned) 
			We get the message, Constable.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER         4.

5   CONTINUED:

					ODO 
			I hope so, Chief. Just remember, 
			the Founders are even better 
			shape-shifters than I am.

	As Odo and O'Brien are talking, QUARK ENTERS the 
	Promenade from the bar, looking distressed.

					QUARK 
			Excuse me, but if you're done 
			scaring my customers away, I'd 
			like to reopen the bar.

					KIRA
			Go right ahead.

					QUARK 
			Thank you.
				(aside to Odo) 
			Constable, it just occurred to me 
			that if I knew in advance how long 
			it would take them to catch you 
			during the next drill... Well 
			let's just say you and I could 
			split a substantial profit.

	Odo harumphs and walks away. Quark smiles about having 
	gotten under Odo's skin.

					QUARK
				(calling after him) 
			Think about it.

	Quark also EXITS. Kira tries to ignore the 
	interruption and get on with her job.

					KIRA
				(to the troops) 
			Performance reviews will be held 
			starting at oh-eight-hundred hours 
			tomorrow in the wardroom. Check 
			with your team leader for the 
			schedule.
				(a beat) 
			Dismissed.

	As everyone walks off ...

6   CLOSE ON SISKO AND KIRA

	They both look a little tired from the drill.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER         5.

6   CONTINUED:

					KIRA 
			How about some dinner?

					SISKO
			Not tonight. I've got a previous 
			engagement.

					KIRA
			Oh, that's right. Captain Yates 
			got in this morning. 
				(smiles) 
			Give her my regards.

					SISKO
			I will.

	With a smile, Sisko hands Kira his phaser rifle and 
	walks away, leaving her holding a pair of rifles.

7   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	Sisko is lighting candles at the dinner table. He's 
	prepared an elaborate meal and he's wearing civilian 
	clothing. The table is set for two. The door CHIMES. 
	Sisko makes a quick last-minute adjustment to the 
	table, then...

					SISKO 
			Come in.

8   NEW ANGLE

	As KASIDY YATES ENTERS. She's dressed nicely and is 
	carrying a gift bag.

					KASIDY 
			Hello, Ben. I hope I'm not 
			too late.


      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 07/13/95 - TEASER     5A.

8   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(smiling)
			Some things are worth waiting for.

	Kasidy studies Sisko's newly shaven head for a beat. 
	Then she reaches out and runs her hand over his scalp.

					KASIDY
				(smiling)
			Nice.

					SISKO
			I'm glad you like it.

	Sisko reaches for a small wrapped package that's 
	sitting on the table.

					SISKO
			Here.  For you.

	Sisko hands her the gift.

					KASIDY
			Isn't that a coincidence? I have
			something for you, too.

	They exchange gifts. Kasidy opens hers first.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER         6.

8   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KASIDY
				(reacting to the scarf, 
				delighted) 
			Where'd you find Tholian silk?

					SISKO 
			The Tholian ambassador owed me a favor.

	She puts it on.

					SISKO
				(re: his gift)
			May I?

					KASIDY
			It's not silk, but I think you'll like it.

	Sisko opens the package and takes out a baseball cap 
	with the logo of the Pike City Pioneers.

					KASIDY
			It's from my brother's team.

					SISKO
				(nodding) 
			The Pike City Pioneers.

					KASIDY
			My brother says if you're ever on 
			Cestus Three, he'll get you seats
			in the dugout.

	Sisko tries it on. It's a perfect fit.

					SISKO
			How far is it to Cestus Three?

					KASIDY
			Eight weeks, at maximum warp.

	Sisko takes off the cap and looks at it wistfully.

					SISKO
			To see a real baseball game... 
			might be worth the trip.


					KASIDY
			Tell you what, if you ever decide 
			to go, I'll take you there myself. 
			As long as you don't mind 
			traveling by freighter.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER         7.

8   CONTINUED:	(3)

					SISKO 
			I might just take you up on that.

	Kasidy looks at the table spread.

					KASIDY
			Did you do this all yourself?

					SISKO
			My father always says the way to 
			a woman's heart is through her 
			stomach.

					KASIDY 
			Ah, so it's my heart you're after.

					SISKO
			I never could keep a secret.

	For a moment they just stare at each other, but then 
	the moment passes. This is going a little faster than 
	either of them intended.

					KASIDY 
			In that case, maybe you could tell 
			me what all those maintenance 
			crews are doing in the docking 
			ring.

	Sisko opens a bottle of wine and begins pouring.

					SISKO
				(evading the question) 
			Just some retrofitting.

					KASIDY
			Now you are keeping a secret.

					SISKO 
			Let's just say we're preparing a 
			few surprises in case the Dominion 
			comes through the wormhole.

					KASIDY 
			Seems like everyone's got the 
			Dominion on their minds these 
			days. I hear the Cardassians have 
			even sealed their borders.

					SISKO
			They're worried about being 
			infiltrated by the Dominion. 


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER        7A.

8   CONTINUED:	(4)

					SISKO (Cont'd)
			The idea that there might be 
			changelings loose in the Alpha 
			Quadrant has everyone a little 
			nervous.

	Sisko hands Kasidy a glass of wine.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER         8.

8   CONTINUED:	(5)


					KASIDY 
			All I know is I've got a cargo 
			hold full of Teresian hardwood 
			bound for Cardassia Prime and now 
			I can't deliver it. If you ask 
			me, I think everyone's being a 
			little paranoid.
				(looks to Sisko for 
				confirmation) 
			Aren't they?

	Sisko'd like to agree, but he can't. There's a short, 
	uncomfortable silence, then...

					SISKO 
			I hope so.
				(doesn't want to talk 
				about it) 
			What do you say we forget about 
			business for a while?

	He raises his glass. He and Kasidy each take sip of wine.

					KASIDY
			I'd say that's a good idea.

	There's a beat and once again the sexual tension is 
	heating up when the com-line CHIRPS.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER         9.

8   CONTINUED:	(6)

					DAX'S COM VOICE
			Dax to Sisko.

	Sisko knows Dax wouldn't interrupt him unless it's an 
	emergency.

					SISKO
				(concerned)
			Go ahead.

					DAX'S COM VOICE
			I think you'd better get up here.

					SISKO
			On my way.
				(to Kasidy)
			I'll be back as soon as I can.

	Kasidy smiles. She knows Sisko doesn't like this any 
	more than she does.

					KASIDY
			I know you will.

	Sisko EXITS. There's a beat as Kasidy looks at the 
	beautifully prepared dinner. Then she shrugs, sits
	down and helps herself to some stew.

9   INT. OPS (OPTICAL)

	Sisko ENTERS from the Turbolift. DAX is at the Ops 
	Table. She's been promoted to Lieutenant Commander and 
	has three pips on her collar. Sisko looks up at the 
	viewscreen which shows a Klingon attack cruiser. It's 
	the latest model, of the same type as the Klingon ship 
	in "All Good Things... "


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER        10.

9   CONTINUED:

					DAX 
			It just decloaked.

					SISKO
				(recognizes it) 
			That's the new Klingon flagship.

					DAX
				(nods, confirming) 
			The Negh'Var. There's a General 
			Martok aboard, asking to speak 
			with you.

					SISKO
			Put him through.

10   ANGLE ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Which shifts to show GENERAL MARTOK, an imposing, 
	battle-scarred Klingon warrior.

					MARTOK
				(on Viewscreen) 
			Captain Sisko. I bring greetings 
			from your allies in the Klingon 
			Empire.

					SISKO
			Welcome to Deep Space Nine, 
			General. Is there something I can 
			do for you?

					MARTOK
			It has been a long journey. My 
			men require shore leave.

					SISKO
			Certainly.  They can come aboard 
			whenever they like.

					MARTOK 
			Good.

	Martok turns and barks a command in Klingon to someone 
	off screen. (English translations are in parentheses.)

					MARTOK
			Sowee TAH! (Uncloak!)


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - TEASER        11.

10   CONTINUED:

	Martok breaks off the transmission.

10A   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	On the Negh'Var. Suddenly, an entire task force of 
	Klingon ships DECLOAKS behind the Negh'Var.

11   INT. OPS

	As Sisko and Dax react to this imposing and somewhat 
	ominous sight.

FADE OUT.

	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

12   INT. QUARK'S

	The mood is subdued. There are several tables full of 
	Klingons scattered around the room. But the Klingons 
	are uncharacteristically somber. They're stone-faced 
	and serious, talking quietly among themselves, and 
	carefully watching the room.

	QUARK is behind the counter, surveying his domain with 
	a frown. A quiet bar is an unprofitable bar.

	Bashir and O'Brien are seated at a table. While Bashir 
	watches, O'Brien places a Gramillion sand pea on the 
	back of his hand, then slaps his wrist, catapulting the 
	sand pea into the air and catching it in his mouth.

					BASHIR
				(smiling) 
			Chief, I'm beginning to think 
			there's no limit to the wonders 
			you can perform.

					O'BRIEN
			That's what I like about you, 
			Julian. You're easily impressed.

	But despite their easy manner, Bashir and O'Brien can't 
	help but be aware of the mood of the Klingons. Quark 
	brings them a pair of drinks. He puts them down on the 
	table, but his attention is still focused on the 
	Klingons.

					BASHIR 
			Thank you, Quark. Can we get a 
			little yamok sauce for these sand 
			peas?

	Quark says nothing. He's definitely spooked.

					BASHIR
				(trying to get his 
				attention) 
			Quark?

	To their surprise, Quark sits down at the table with 
	them.

					QUARK
				(quietly) 
			Listen. Do you hear that?

					BASHIR 
			I don't hear a thing.

					QUARK 
			Exactly. The ambient noise level 
			in this room is less than thirty 
			decibels. On an average day it's 
			sixty-five. When there're 
			Klingons in the room, it can go as 
			high as eighty-five.

					O'BRIEN
			So what you're saying is, it's 
			quiet in here.

					QUARK 
			Too quiet. Something is terribly 
			wrong.

					BASHIR 
			Like what?

					QUARK 
			I don't know. But have you ever 
			met a quiet Klingon before? 
				(a beat) 
			And look at the way they're 
			watching the room. It's like... 
			they're picking out targets.

	O'Brien gets up.

					QUARK
				(panicky) 
			Where are you going?

					O'BRIEN
			I thought I'd ask the Klingons 
			what they're up to.

	Quark knows he's kidding, but can't take chances.

					QUARK
			Don't do that.

					O'BRIEN
			Why not?


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT ONE       14.

13   CONTINUED:	(2)

					QUARK 
			I don't want them to know we're on 
			to them.

					O'BRIEN 
			Suit yourself.

	O'Brien and Bashir relax. Bashir tries to duplicate 
	O'Brien's trick with the sand pea. He misses.

					O'BRIEN 
			The secret is positioning the pea 
			correctly on your hand.

					BASHIR 
			I thought I did.

	Bashir reaches for another sand pea, but Quark moves 
	the bowl away.

					QUARK 
			What are you two doing? I'm 
			telling you, the Klingons are up 
			to something.

					BASHIR 
			Calm down, Quark. The Klingons 
			are our allies.

					QUARK 
			They might be your allies, but 
			they're not mine.

					O'BRIEN
			Relax. If something's up with the 
			Klingons, Captain Sisko will find 
			out about it.

	Quark thinks it over. He's still got a bad feeling 
	about this.

					QUARK 
			Yeah. But will he tell me?

									CUT TO:

14   INT. WARDROOM

	Sisko, Kira and General Martok are standing at the 
	table.

					SISKO 
			So what brings you here, General?


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT ONE       15.

14   CONTINUED:

					MARTOK 
			A valid question. But first ...

	Martok draws his dagger.

					MARTOK 
			Let us be sure we are all who we 
			say we are.

	Martok cuts his hand and lets the blood drip onto the 
	tabletop. After waiting for a beat, he hands the 
	dagger to Sisko. Kira is surprised and a little taken 
	aback.

					KIRA 
			You think we're changelings?

					MARTOK 
			What I think doesn't matter. The 
			blood will tell.

	Sisko considers Martok's request, then takes the knife, 
	cuts his hand, and lets a drop of blood fall to the 
	table. Martok examines it closely, then nods his 
	approval. Sisko passes the knife to Kira. Kira cuts 
	her hand, then smears the blood on the table.

15   CLOSE ON MARTOK

	Martok examines her blood too. After a beat, he 
	visibly relaxes. He sits down. Sisko and Kira follow 
	suit.

					SISKO
				(still waiting for his 
				answer) 
			Now that that's over with...

					MARTOK 
			We've been sent here to fight 
			alongside our Federation allies 
			against the Dominion.

	Sisko relaxes a little. Though the Klingon presence is 
	unexpected, he understands their reasoning.

					SISKO 
			I appreciate the gesture. But I'm 
			not sure it's necessary.

					MARTOK 
			The Klingon High Council thinks it 
			is.

15   CONTINUED:

					SISKO 
			Our communications relay in the

			giving the wormhole a wide berth.

					MARTOK 
			They will come. 
				(a beat) 
			And when they do, we will be ready

	And there's a finality about Martok's word that seems 
	to end the discussion. Off Sisko and Kira's

17   INT. TRILL PUBLIC BATHS (HOLOSUITE)

	We're in a small side chamber of a larger complex of 
	baths. We can hear the sounds of a large number of 
	people talking, bathing and swimming echoing through 
	a vast (unseen) space.

	This particular area is a steam room curtained off 
	from the rest of the baths by heavy hanging tapestries. 
	Kira is seated on a bench in front of a steam-producing 
	device, wearing the garment she picked up from Garak.

     	Suddenly the tapestries are parted, and Dax ENTERS, 
	also wearing a kifata, arm in arm with two male Trills, 
	who are, if anything, wearing even less clothing than 
	the women. Dax and her friends seem to be having a 
	pretty good time.

					DAX
			There you are. We've been looking 
			all over for you. Malko here just 
			gave me an amazing massage. I'm 
			sure if you ask nicely he'd be 
			willing to do the same for you.

	Malko smiles in acknowledgement.

					KIRA 
			No thanks.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT ONE       17.

17   CONTINUED:

					DAX 
			Why?

					KIRA
				(stating the obvious)
			Because Malko isn't real. He's a 
			puppet made of holographic light 
			and replicated matter.

	Dax sighs. Getting Kira to relax and enjoy herself is 
	going to be just as hard as she thought.

					DAX
				(to Malko and friend) 
			Boys, can you wait outside?

	Malko shrugs and he and his friend EXIT.

					KIRA
				(needling Dax) 
			Afraid I hurt their feelings?

					DAX
			You really should try to get into 
			the spirit of things. People come 
			from all over Trill to visit the 
			Hoobishan Baths.

					KIRA
			And if I'm ever on Trill I'll 
			visit them too. But we're not on 
			Trill and this isn't the Hoobishan 
			Baths. It's a holosuite. Nothing 
			here is real.

					DAX
				("so what?")
			And?

	Kira sighs. This is making her a touch melancholy.

					KIRA 
			I'm sorry Dax. I just feel... 
			silly.

					DAX
			Good. That's what a holosuite's 
			for. To have a good time. All 
			you have to do is relax and use 
			your imagination.

	Dax doesn't realize it, but she's just hit the crux 
	of the problem.

17   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA 
			I guess I don't have much of an 
			imagination.

					DAX
			Of course you do. Everyone does.
			Didn't you used to play make-
			believe when you were a kid?

					KIRA
				(softly) 
			Yeah. I used to make-believe that 
			all the Cardassians would stop 
			killing Bajorans and just go away.

	Even though Kira's tone is soft, Dax knows she's 
	touched a nerve.

					DAX
			I'm sorry, I didn't mean--

					KIRA
				(gently interrupting) 
			No. I'm the one who's sorry. I 
			guess I've never gotten much use 
			out of my imagination.
				(a beat) 
			I mean, look at me. You planned 
			a fun evening for us and all I can 
			do is sit here and worry about 
			Klingons.

					DAX
			You can worry about them tomorrow. 
			From what I hear, they aren't 
			going anywhere.
				(a beat) 
			And as for your underdeveloped 
			imagination, I prescribe a strict 
			regimen of exercise... starting 
			immediately.

	Kira smiles. Dax's enthusiasm is contagious.

					KIRA 
			All right, I'll give it a try.

					DAX
			That's all I ask.
				(a beat) 
			Come on. Malko couldn't have 
			gotten far.

	Together they stand up, and EXIT the steam room.

19   INT. PROMENADE 

	It's early in the morning. The activity on the
	Promenade is light, except for a sprinkling of 
	Klingons, scattered about in groups of twos and threes. 
	The Klingons don't seem to be doing much of anything, 
	just talking quietly among themselves and watching the 
	Promenade. But there's something meticulous about 
	their placement and military about their bearing, 
	almost like they're sentries on watch.

20   INT. REPLIMAT

	Garak and Odo are eating breakfast. Garak has a full 
	meal. Odo is sipping from a cup of coffee, which he 
	keeps constantly in his right hand. Throughout the 
	scene, Odo maintains a casual surveillance of the 
	Klingons on the Promenade.

					GARAK
				(re: the coffee) 
			Fascinating. So both the cup and 
			the liquid are merely extensions 
			of your body.

					ODO
			That's correct. And if I want to, I 
			can even drink the liquid,
			reabsorb it, and produce new 
			"coffee" in the cup.

	Demonstrating, Odo takes a swallow, then holds out the
	cup. It's refilled.

					ODO
				(holds up cup) 
			This way I can give the illusion 
			that I'm sharing in the dining 
			experience.

					GARAK 
			Very thoughtful.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT ONE       20.

20   CONTINUED:

					ODO 
			So, perhaps you'd like to tell me 
			what's bothering you?

					GARAK
			Why do you think something's 
			bothering me?

					ODO
			Because you're almost done with 
			your meal. It usually takes you 
			twice as long to eat your 
			breakfast.

					GARAK 
			Does it?

					ODO
			In my experience, most mornings 
			you're more interested in talking 
			than eating.

					GARAK 
			Maybe I'm just hungry today.

	Odo gives Garak a skeptical look. Garak knows he's not 
	fooling anyone and decides to come clean.

					GARAK 
			Tell me, Odo, have you heard any 
			news from Cardassia lately?

					ODO
			Not since they sealed their 
			borders.

					GARAK 
			Well I have.  And frankly I don't 
			like what I've been hearing. 
			Rumors of uprisings, civil 
			disturbances. All very alarming.

					ODO
			I didn't know you still had 
			friends inside the Empire.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 07/10/95 - ACT ONE     21.

20   CONTINUED:	(2)

					GARAK
				(shrugging) 
			One or two. But now I can't even 
			get through to them.
				(a beat) 
			I'm worried. With the destruction 
			of the Obsidian Order and the 
			threat of the Dominion, these are 
			unsettling times for Cardassia.

 					ODO 
			They're unsettling times for 
			everyone. But, if I hear 
			anything, I'll let you know.

  					GARAK 
			I'd appreciate that, Constable.

	But throughout the above, Odo's been staring at the 
	Klingons on the Promenade. As he watches, they stop 
	and question MORN, as if challenging his right to be 
	there. Despite his protests, they begin searching his 
	duffel bag. This is the last straw for Odo, who's 
	clearly been bothered by the way the Klingons have been 
	acting.

					ODO 
			Excuse me a moment.

	Overcome with curiosity, Garak gets up and follows Odo. 
	As they approach the Klingons, one of them, DREX, a 
	wiry, arrogant young warrior, is still hassling Morn.

					DREX
				(to Morn) 
			So what is it that you do on this 
			station?

	Before Morn can answer...

					ODO
				(to the Klingons) 
			May I help you?

	Drex stares daggers at Odo.

	The other Klingon laughs. Drex turns away.

					GARAK 
			Actually, I'm not sure Constable 
			Odo has a mother.

	Drex looks back at Garak, surprised and almost offended 
	that a Cardassian can speak his language.

					ODO
			Morn, I believe Ensign Sanders is 
			looking for you.

	Morn EXITS. Odo turns to Klingons.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT ONE     22.

23   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO 
			Gentlemen, if you have business on 
			the Promenade, I suggest you go 
			about it. If not, move along.

					GARAK 
			I'd listen to him if I were you.

					DREX 
			I don't take orders from 
			Shape-shifters.
				(to Garak) 
			Or their Cardassian lapdogs.

					ODO
			I may be a Shape-shifter, but I'm 
			also chief of security of this 
			station. So either you move 
			along, or you'll be continuing 
			this conversation from inside a 
			holding cell.

	There's a beat as Drex looks from Odo to Garak. He'd 
	love to start a fight, but he has orders not to.

					DREX
				(to Odo) 
			As long as you wear that Bajoran 
			uniform, we're allies. Make sure 
			you never take it off.

	Drex nods to his companion, and they walk off. Odo is 
	not impressed.

					ODO
				(talking to Garak, but 
				his eyes still on Drex) 
			I didn't know you spoke Klingon.

					GARAK 
			You'd be surprised at the kind of 
			things you can learn while you're

	Odo harumphs. But neither of them completely relaxes.

	As Garak ENTERS his shop, four Klingons step out from 
	either side of the door and block the exit. One of 
	them is Drex. Garak knows a setup when he sees one.

26   NEW ANGLE

     Garak looks at the Klingons.

					GARAK 
			Let me guess, you're either lost 
			or you're desperately searching 
			for a good tailor.

	Drex steps forward and punches Garak, knocking him to 
	the ground. And as the other three Klingons close in, 
	we ...

27   INT. INFIRMARY

	Bashir is treating Garak for his injuries. He's 
	already done most of the patching up, though Garak is 
	still sore.

					BASHIR 
			I can't believe you're not pressing 
			charges.

					GARAK  
			Constable Odo and Captain Sisko  
			expressed similar concern. But  
			really, Doctor, there was no harm
			done.

					BASHIR  
			They broke seven of your 
			transverse ribs and fractured your 
			clavicle.

					GARAK 
			But I got off several cutting 
			remarks that no doubt did serious 
			damage to their egos.

					BASHIR 
			Garak, it's not funny.

					GARAK 
			I'm serious, Doctor. Thanks to 
			your ministrations, I'm almost 
			completely healed. The damage I 
			did to them will last a lifetime.
				(a beat) 
			What I can't understand is their 
			inexplicable hostility toward me. 
			Maligning Constable Odo is one 
			thing... after all he is a 
			changeling and the Klingons don't  
			know him as well as we do. But  
			relations between the Klingon and  
			Cardassian Empires have never been  
			anything but amicable.

					BASHIR 
			With the exception of the Betreka 
			Nebula incident.

					GARAK
				(dismissive)  
			A minor skirmish.

					BASHIR
			That lasted eighteen years.

					GARAK 
			That was ages ago.

					BASHIR
				(humoring him) 
			Not like you? Impossible.

					GARAK
			You're right, as always, Doctor.
				(smiles) 
			They must've mistaken me for

28   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Sisko is at his desk, being updated by Kira.

					KAYBOK
 				(on Viewscreen)

					KIRA
			Search them for what?

					KAYBOK

			For Shape-shifters. Each ship will 
			be scanned, its cargo searched, 
			and its crewmembers and passengers 
			subjected to genetic testing.

					SISKO
			On whose authority?


					KAYBOK
				(on Viewscreen) 
			On the authority of Gowron and the 
			Klingon High Council.

					KAYBOK

			How can we have evidence until we

					KIRA
			Commander, Bajoran law strictly

			must've been good.

					SISKO
			Is everyone all right?

	Kasidy knows that he's really asking about her. She 
	smiles.

						KASIDY
				(on viewscreen)
			"Everyone" is fine.

					SISKO
			I'm glad to hear that.

	There's a beat. Everyone knows that there's a personal 
	undertone to this conversation, but they pretend not to 
	notice.

					SISKO 
			We'll keep you on sensors as long

					KASIDY 
			I appreciate that, Captain. I'll 
			see you in about two weeks.

					SISKO
			You know where to find me.

	Re-establishing, with the Klingon ships.

38   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Sisko and Dax are in mid-conversation.

					DAX 
			According to our long-range 
			sensors, the Klingon task force 
			has withdrawn to just outside 
			Bajoran territory.

					SISKO
			So now they're in unclaimed space. 
			And if they decide to continue 
			searching ships ....

					DAX
			There's nothing we can do about 
			it. Unless they try to stop a 
			Federation or Bajoran vessel.

					SISKO
			Which, so far, they haven't done.

	Just then, the com-line CHIRPS.

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE 
			Captain, General Martok is here to 
			see you.

					SISKO
			Send him in.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 07/10/95 - ACT TWO     32.

39   NEW ANGLE

	As Martok strides into the room. He looks angry.

					SISKO
			General, we need to talk 
			about ...

	But Martok ignores him, slamming a Klingon ceremonial 
	dagger onto his desk.

					MARTOK 
			SOHK-vad. (For you.)

	Martok immediately turns and EXITS. Dax goes to 
	examine the dagger. She looks at the family crest on 
	the hilt.

					DAX
			It's Commander Kaybok's.

					SISKO
			Why give it to me?

					DAX
			He's letting you know Kaybok's 
			dead. Martok probably had him 
			executed for disobeying orders.

	Sisko looks at the knife, grimly absorbing the news.

					SISKO 
			Which means our next confrontation 
			with the Klingons won't be 
			resolved so easily.
				(a beat) 
			Any suggestions, old man?

					DAX
			The longer the Klingons stay here, 
			the worse things are going to get. 
			Whatever you decide to do, you'd 
			better do it soon.

	Sisko thinks about it for a beat, then allows himself 
	a grim smile.

					SISKO 
			Curzon told me once that in the 
			long run, the only people who can 
			really handle Klingons are 
			Klingons.
				(makes up his mind) 
			Get me Starfleet Command.

	FADE IN:

45   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Sisko is standing behind his desk, looking out at the 
	stars. The door opens and Worf ENTERS.

					WORF 
			Lieutenant Commander Worf 
			reporting for duty.

					SISKO
			It's good to have you aboard, 
			commander.

					WORF
			Thank you, sir.

	Worf's bearing is very military and precise. He's 
	standing at attention and Sisko realizes that he's 
	waiting to be told to stand at ease.

					SISKO 
			At ease, Mister Worf.

	Worf's posture relaxes somewhat, but we can see
	that he's still treating this as a formal occasion. Sisko 
	tries to break the ice.

					SISKO 
			I was sorry to hear about the 
			Enterprise. She was a good ship.


					WORF
				(trying to be stoic) 
			Yes, sir.

	Sisko sees that this is not something that Worf wants 
	to dwell on, and quickly changes the subject.

					SISKO 
			I understand you've been on 
			extended leave ...

					WORF
			I've been visiting the Klingon 
			monastery on Boreth. I found my 
			discussions with the clerics 
			there... most enlightening.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT THREE      35.

45   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			I hope you'll forgive me for  
			pulling you away from your  
			studies. I doubt this assignment  
			will last very long.


					WORF
			My leave was almost over.

					SISKO
			Any idea where you're going to be 
			stationed next?

	Worf takes a long beat before responding, then...

					WORF 
			I'm considering resigning my 
			commission.

	Worf's news catches Sisko a little off guard.

					SISKO
			Really? Do you mind if I ask why?

					WORF
			I've spent most of my life among 
			humans. It has not always been 
			easy for me. And since the 
			destruction of the Enterprise, it 
			has become even more difficult. 
			I am no longer sure I belong in 
			this uniform.

	Sisko is in an awkward position. He needs Worf to help 
	him willingly, not because he's being forced.

					SISKO
			Mister Worf, if I said we didn't 
			need you here, I'd be lying. But 
			if you don't want to take this 
			assignment, I'd understand.

					WORF
			Thank you, sir. But until I make 
			my decision, I intend to do my 
			duty.

					SISKO
			I'm glad to hear that. 
				(a beat) 
			I assume you've read my situation 
			report.

	Worf nods.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way...Warrior"-REV. 08/01/95 - ACT THREE     36.

45   CONTINUED: 	(2)

					SISKO  
			I can't help feeling that General  
			Martok hasn't told me the whole  
			truth about the Klingon task 
			force. There are too many 
			unanswered questions.

					WORF
			Then I will find you some answers.

	That's what Sisko wanted to hear.

					SISKO 
			Good. If you need any help, let 
			me know.

					WORF
			Yes, sir.

	Worf starts to exit, but Sisko calls after him.

					SISKO
			Commander.

	Worf turns.

					SISKO
				(continuing)
			I thought about resigning from 
			Starfleet once, too. But I know 
			if I had, I would've regretted it.
				(a beat) 
			Don't make any quick decisions.

					WORF
			Thank you, sir. I'll keep that in 
			mind.

	Worf EXITS.  Hold on Sisko for a beat.

									CUT TO:

46   INT. QUARK'S

	The bar is busy. There are a couple of Klingons 
	scattered around. Worf ENTERS and looks around, sizing 
	up the place. He sidles up to the bar, where Quark is 
	serving drinks.

					QUARK
			Let me guess, Klingon bloodwine.

					WORF
			Prune juice, chilled.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT THREE    37.

46   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
				(surprised) 
			Prune juice?

	Worf gives Quark his best intimidating glower.

					QUARK
				(backs down) 
			If you say so.

	As Quark goes to get him a prune juice from the 
	replicator, Worf surveys the crowd like a sheriff in an 
	old Western.

					O'BRIEN (O.C.) 
			Commander, over here.

47   NEW ANGLE 

	Worf turns and sees O'Brien and Bashir, standing by the 
	dartboard. O'Brien waves him over. Worf takes the 
	prune juice and joins them.

					O'BRIEN
				(making introductions) 
			Doctor Julian Bashir, Lieutenant 
			Commander Worf.

	Bashir and Worf exchange nods. Bashir holds up a dart.

					BASHIR 
			Care for a game of darts?

					WORF
			I don't play games.

					O'BRIEN
				(joking) 
			It's like poker, but with pointy 
			tips.

	Worf just stares at him unimpressed.

					O'BRIEN 
			All right, think of it as target 
			practice.

					BASHIR 
			The object is to throw the dart 
			and hit that board over there.

					O'BRIEN
			Aim for the dot in the middle.

	Worf looks skeptical, but he takes the dart, holding it 
	by the tip like a throwing dagger, then flings it at 
	the board like he's trying to kill it.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT THREE      38.

48   CLOSE ON THE BOARD

	He doesn't hit the bullseye, but he does bury the 
	dart two inches into the board.

49   CLOSE ON WORF

	Who gives the slightest hint of a smile.

50   ANGLE ON BASHIR AND O'BRIEN

	As they look at the dart. If the board was a person, 
	it'd be dead now. Just then...

51   NEW ANGLE

	As we hear Dax and Kira arguing as they come down the 
	spiral stairs near the board. They're dressed like 
	princesses from a medieval fairy tale, complete 
	with pointed hats and veils.

					DAX
			I can't believe you did that.

					KIRA
			He didn't leave me any choice.

					BASHIR
			What did she do?

					DAX
			She knocked out Lancelot.

					KIRA 
			He kissed me.

					DAX
			He's supposed to kiss you.

					KIRA
			But I was playing a married woman.

	Bashir and O'Brien are having a hard time keeping a 
	straight face.

					BASHIR
			Lieutenant Commander Worf, this is
			Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax,
			and Major Kira Nerys, our first
			officer.

					WORF 
				(to Kira)
			Nice hat.


    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT THREE    39.

51   CONTINUED:

	Kira realizes she's still wearing the princess hat and 
	yanks it off her head.

					KIRA
				(defensive) 
			I don't always dress like this. 
			We were in the holosuite...

					WORF
			So I gathered.
				(turns to Dax) 
			You used to be Curzon Dax.

					DAX
			That's right.
				(smiling) 
			And I don't usually dress like 
			this either.

					WORF
			Curzon's name is an honored one 
			among my people.

					DAX
				(mischievous, in
				Klingon)
			Louk, a jeek CHIM-ta law. (Yeah,
			but I'm a lot better looking than
			he was.)

	Worf is a little flustered, both by Dax's seeming lack 
	of respect for Curzon, and by the complexities of 
	joined Trill gender.

					WORF
				(uncomfortable) 
			I suppose so.

	Just then, Worf sees Drex and two of his friends 
	swagger into the bar and order drinks.

					DREX 
			Bloodwine, and hurry.

					WORF
			Excuse me.

52   CLOSE ON KIRA AND DAX

	As Worf walks away.

					KIRA 
			What did you say to him?


    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT THREE    40.

52   CONTINUED:

					DAX
			It loses something in the
			translation.

53   NEW ANGLE

	On Drex, who is standing at the bar, yelling at a 
	Ferengi waiter.

					DREX
			This bloodwine is cold.

	Drex hurls the cup of bloodwine against the wall.

					DREX
			Get me another.

	Worf steps up to Drex.

					WORF
				(not a question)
			You are Drex, son of Martok.

					DREX
				(condescending)
			That's right.

					WORF
			I am Worf, son of Mogh.

	Without warning, Worf hauls back and punches Drex in 
	the face, knocking him back against the bar. Drex is 
	stunned. He reaches to draw his knife, but before he 
	can get it out, Worf hits him with a quick combination, 
	and Drex falls to the ground, unconscious.

	The other Klingons aren't sure how to react, but when
	Worf snarls at them, they back off. Worf reaches down 
	and takes Drex's dagger. He places the dagger in his 
	belt and EXITS.

54   ANGLE ON KIRA, DAX, BASHIR, AND O'BRIEN

	Who have watched the preceding in amazement. Only Dax 
	really understands what's going on. She smiles.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT THREE      41.

54   CONTINUED:

					DAX  
			He's good.

					O'BRIEN
			What did I tell you?

55   INT. GUEST QUARTERS 

	Worf has been given quarters in the habitat ring. 
	They've got the same layout as Kira's. He's unpacking
	a few personal items from his duffel bag, which include
	a bat'leth, a phaser, some items of clothing and a 
	picture of Alexander. The door CHIMES.

					WORF 
			Enter.

56   NEW ANGLE

	As General Martok ENTERS.

					MARTOK 
			I have come for my son's d'k tahg. 
			Give it to me or I will take it 
			from you.

	Martok expects to have to challenge Worf to regain his 
	son's honor, but to his surprise, Worf hands him the 
	dagger.

					WORF 
			Now that you're here, I have no 
			further need for it.

	Martok looks at the dagger. In some ways, this is even 
	worse than having to fight for it.

					MARTOK 
				(shocked) 
			You robbed my son of his honor 
			just to get my attention?

					WORF
			You can't take away what someone 
			doesn't have.


	Martok is gravely offended.

					MARTOK 
			Are you saying my son is without 
			honor?


    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT THREE    42.

56   CONTINUED:

					WORF  
			I am saying your son is a coward  
			and a liar.


					MARTOK  
			And what of his father?

					WORF
			That remains to be seen.

	Martok is torn between his anger at Worf's behavior and 
	his bewilderment at not understanding his motivations.

					MARTOK 
			Tell me, what have I done to earn 
			your disrespect?

					WORF
			The misdeeds your troops have 
			committed speak for themselves. 
			Assaulting a Cardassian tailor. 
			Detaining and searching ships in 
			neutral space without warning or 
			provocation. And you... executing 
			one of your own commanders because 
			he refused to fire on a Federation 
			ship...

					MARTOK 
			Whatever we've done has been in 
			the best interests of the Alpha 
			Quadrant.

					WORF
			You must think me a fool to make 
			your lies so transparent.

	Martok is about to respond in anger, but he catches 
	himself. He sees now what Worf is trying to do.

					MARTOK 
			I do not wish to quarrel with you, 
			Worf.

					WORF
			Nor I with you. 
				(a beat) 
			The House of Martok is an honored 
			one, with a proud tradition. But 
			I need to know why you are here.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT THREE      43.

56   CONTINUED:	(2)

					MARTOK  
			I am here under the authority of  
			Gowron himself. I am carrying out 
			his orders. That should be all 
			the explanation a Klingon warrior 
			needs.

					WORF
			You forget, I am not just a 
			Klingon warrior. I am a Starfleet 
			officer. And Starfleet deserves 
			an explanation.

					MARTOK 
			They will get one soon enough. 
			But until then, know this... My 
			mission will determine the fate of 
			the Klingon Empire. Interfere, 
			and you risk destroying us all.

	And with that, Martok EXITS. Hold on Worf's troubled 
	expression for a beat.

									CUT TO:

57   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	Re-establishing with the Klingon ships.

S8   INT. CAVE (HOLOSUITE)

	Worf is wielding a Klingon saber, fighting a hulking 
	ogre-like monster from Klingon mythology. He and the 
	monster exchange a flurry of blows. Worf barely 
	manages to fend him off. He's here to let off steam 
	and he's got the program set on maximum.

59   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) 

	There's the SOUND of a door opening and closing and Dax 
	ENTERS. Worf is momentarily distracted, and narrowly 
	avoids getting split in two by his opponent's weapon.

					DAX
			You shouldn't drop your left 
			arm like that.

					WORF
				(still fighting) 
			I don't recall asking for your 
			advice.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT THREE      44.

59   CONTINUED:

					DAX
			Just trying to help.

	Just then, Worf launches into a quick combination and 
	finishes off his opponent, who falls to the ground, 
	then DEMATERIALIZES.

					DAX
			So, how'd you like the program?

					WORF
			I found it... adequate. Though I
			was surprised to find a Klingon
			exercise program in this
			holosuite.

					DAX
			It's mine.

					WORF
			You mean Curzon's.

					DAX
			No.  I mean mine.
				(to com)
			Computer, bat'leth.

60   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	On Worf's bat'leth, which is stuck in the ground. 
	Dax's bat'leth MATERIALIZES next to it.

					DAX
				(off Worf's reaction)
			I thought you might be tired of
			fighting holograms.

	Dax picks up her bat'leth. Worf looks at her as if 
	she's crazy.

					WORF
			It would not be a fair match.

					DAX
				(playful)
			I'll go easy on you.

	Worf can't let that one slide by.

					WORF
			Very well. Defend yourself.

	Worf switches weapons, taking up his own bat'leth.


    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT THREE    45.

61   NEW ANGLE 

	As Worf and Jadzia begin to fence. Worf is bigger and 
	stronger, but Dax is faster and more maneuverable. 
	They're much more evenly matched than Worf expected.
	She illustrates this by going on the offensive, 
	executing a tricky combination that puts Worf off 
	balance and almost scores a hit.

					DAX
				(still fighting) 
			I hope you're not holding back 
			because I'm a woman. If it makes 
			things easier, think of me as a 
			man. I have been one several 
			times.

	As if in answer, Worf launches into an offensive 
	combination of his own.

	Using his superior strength and size, he drives her 
	back... Then sweeps her legs and brings her to the 
	ground.

					WORF 
			I see you haven't forgotten all 
			that Curzon knew about the 
			bat'leth.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT THREE      46.

61   CONTINUED:

	Dax looks up at Worf, who is standing over her.

					DAX
				(smiles) 
			Feel better?
				(off Worf's reaction) 
			I take it your conversation with 
			General Martok didn't go all that 
			well.

	She holds out her hand. He looks at it for a beat, 
	then reluctantly helps her up, still not sure what to 
	make of her.

					WORF 
			He was not forthcoming. And he's 
			not the only one. I tried 
			contacting Gowron, Emperor 
			Kahless, even my own brother who 
			sits on the High Council. No one 
			will speak with me.

					DAX
				(she thinks it over) 
			Maybe you're going about this the 
			wrong way.
				(off Worf's reaction) 
			With so many Klingons around, 
			there must be someone who owes 
			your family a favor.

	And as these words sink in...

62   CONTINUED: 

	And with that they both drink deep from half-empty 
	bottles of bloodwine, butt heads ferociously, and laugh 
	out loud. They're both a little intoxicated, Huraga 
	more so than Worf.

					HURAGA
				(having a great time) 
			Your father and I used to sing 
			that song when you were just a 
			small boy.
				(a beat) 
			Did I ever tell you how your 
			father saved my family's honor 
			during our bloodfeud with the 
			House of Duras?

					WORF  
			Many times.

					HURAGA 
			It is a good story.

					WORF
			You tell it well.

					HURAGA 
			Your father was a great warrior. 
			My family owes him everything we 
			have. I wish there was some way 
			I could repay him.

	Worf gets serious and leans closer to Huraga.

					WORF 
			There is. Tell me why the task 
			force is here. The real reason, 
			not the one Martok has given to 
			the Federation.

	Huraga studies Worf for a second. He no longer seems 
	quite as drunk as he did a minute ago.

					HURAGA 
			The real reason?
				(a beat) 
			I suppose you have the right to 
			know. You are a Klingon warrior 
			and it would be wrong to keep you 
			away from battle.
				(smiles) 
			And it's going to be a glorious

62B   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL 

	Worf is standing at the railing, looking over the crowd 
	below. A group of Klingons troop by.

					ODO (O.S.) 
			It all seems simpler from up here, 
			doesn't it?

	Worf turns and sees that Odo has joined him at the 
	railing.

					WORF
			If you're looking to start a 
			conversation, look somewhere else. 
			I'd prefer to be left alone.

					ODO
			That may be. But you can't stay 
			up here forever. Sooner or later 
			you're going to have to talk to 
			Captain Sisko. Whatever it is 
			you've found out about the 
			Klingons, he should be the first 
			to know.

	This gets a reaction out of Worf. Odo's obviously been 
	keeping tabs on him.

					WORF
				(angry) 
			You have been spying on me.

	But Odo's not about to back down to Worf.

					ODO
				(with an edge)
 			As Chief of Security, it's my duty

			Then last night, you met with a

			And since then, you haven't sent

 					WORF 
			None of which is your business.

					ODO
			The security of this station is my

					WORF
			I'm not interested in your

	Worf turns to go.

					ODO

	Worf turns around. He's barely able to control his 
	temper. But to his surprise, Odo eases up a little.

					ODO 
			I just wanted to say that I 
			understand what you're going 
			through. I've also had to choose 
			between duty and loyalty to my 
			people.

					WORF
				(dismissive) 
			I've read your Starfleet security

	Worf's had enough of Odo, and Odo's had enough of him.

					ODO

			Frankly, Mister Worf, I don't care

	And with that, Odo walks away, leaving Worf alone 
	at the railing, feeling the pressure bearing down on him.

62C   INT. OPS

	Worf ENTERS and spots Chief O'Brien.

					O'BRIEN 
			Mister Worf. What can I do for

					WORF
			Where is Captain Sisko?

					O'BRIEN 
			I think he's in a briefing session 
			with--

					WORF
				(cuts him off) 
			I need to speak with him. Now.

	O'Brien looks at Worf. He knows he means it.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 07/10/95 - ACT THREE    48.

63   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Sisko reacts to Worf's report.

					SISKO  
			Cardassia? Why would the Klingons  
			want to invade Cardassia?

	Worf shifts uncomfortably. This isn't easy for him.

					WORF 
			According to my source, there's 
			been an uprising on the Cardassian 
			homeworld. The Central Command 
			has been overthrown and power has 
			been transferred to civilian 
			authorities.

					SISKO
			Even if your source is correct, 
			what does that have to do with the 
			Klingons?

	This is tearing Worf up. He wishes he never accepted 
	the assignment.

					WORF 
			Gowron and the High Council 
			believe that the coup was 
			engineered by the Dominion.

					SISKO
			Do they have any proof?

					WORF
			None that I know of. But they're 
			convinced that civilians could not 
			have overthrown the Central 
			Command without help.

					SISKO
			So by attacking Cardassia, they 
			think they're protecting the Alpha 
			Quadrant from the Dominion.

	Worf nods. He looks uncomfortable, not buying the 
	logic any more than Sisko.


					SISKO 
				(to com) 
			Sisko to Dax. Contact General 
			Martok. Tell him I need to meet 
			with him immediately.

					DAX'S COM VOICE 
			Yes, sir.


    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT THREE    49.

63   CONTINUED:

	Sisko looks over at Worf. He can tell Worf's deeply 
	troubled with the way things have turned out.

					SISKO 
			Mister Worf, I know this hasn't 
			been an easy assignment for you...

					WORF
				(interrupting) 
			No. But I knew this day would 
			come again.
				(melancholy) 
			That I'd be forced to choose 
			between the Federation and the 
			Klingon Empire.

					SISKO
			Maybe you don't have to make that 
			choice just yet.
				(off Worf's reaction) 
			I don't think there's any need for 
			you to be there when I meet with 
			Martok.

	Worf would love to take Sisko up on his offer. He 
	knows this would give him an out. But honor demands 
	that he face Martok for his betrayal.

					WORF 
			I would prefer to be there. I 
			cannot avoid responsibility for 
			what I have done today.

	Sisko nods, understanding both Worf's situation and his 
	decision.

64   INT. WARDROOM

	Sisko and Worf face Martok across the wardroom table. 
	Martok seems unconcerned that Sisko has discovered 
	their plan.

					MARTOK  
			I must compliment you on your  
			intelligence network, Captain.
				(addressing Sisko, but 
				eyeing Worf)  
			One day, you must tell me how you 
			learned of our plans.

	Worf refuses to conceal the truth. He knows Martok 
	holds him in contempt and wants to show him that he 
	will not hide from confrontation.

					WORF 
			General, I--

	Sisko holds up his hand, cutting Worf off.

						SISKO
				(interrupting) 
			How I got the information isn't 
			important.

					MARTOK
				(still looking at Worf)  
			I think it is. And so will  
			Gowron.

	But Sisko has more pressing business on his mind.

					SISKO 
			General, I want you to call off 
			this attack.

					MARTOK 
			And what do you propose we do 
			instead? Stand by and let the 
			Dominion take over the Alpha 
			Quadrant?

					SISKO
			You have no proof that there are 
			any Founders on Cardassia.

					MARTOK 
			The change in government is all 
			the proof we need.

					WORF
			What if you're wrong?

					MARTOK 
			That would be unfortunate... for 
			the Cardassians.


       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT THREE      51.

64   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO 
			General, the Federation council 
			has made it clear to me that they 
			cannot support your plans to 
			attack Cardassia.

	This surprises Martok. The Klingons assumed that the 
	Federation would go along with their plan.

					MARTOK 
			Are you saying the Federation will 
			sit back and do nothing while 
			Klingon soldiers give their lives 
			to protect the Alpha Quadrant?

					WORF
			Starfleet will not participate in 
			an unprovoked invasion.

	This is a setback, but Martok isn't going to let it get 
	to him.

					MARTOK 
			Then the victory will be ours alone.

					SISKO
			General, I'd advise you to 
			reconsider. The Federation 
			Council has informed Gowron that 
			if the attack goes forward, it 
			will jeopardize our treaty with 
			the Klingon Empire.

	This makes Martok thoughtful.

					MARTOK 
			Believe me, Captain. We have no 
			wish to antagonize your people.

					SISKO
			Then call off the attack.

	Martok looks like he's actually considering it.

					MARTOK 
			I will consult with Gowron. You 
			will have his decision within the 
			hour.

	Martok gets up and heads for the door. He passes Worf, 
	staring at him in contempt, then exits. Sisko looks at 
	Worf, deeply concerned for his officer.

	All eyes turn to Worf, who translates.

						WORF
				(translating) 
			"Begin."

					O'BRIEN
			I'm picking up a huge distortion

					KIRA
			Can you plot their course?

					O'BRIEN
				(as he works) 
			Judging from the vector of the

	FADE IN:

67   INT. WARDROOM

	Sisko has called a meeting of the senior staff. Kira, 
	Dax, Worf, Bashir, Odo and O'Brien are all present. 
	Worf sits silently off to one side, seemingly lost 
	in his own thoughts.

					SISKO 
			The Federation Council is trying 
			to contact Gowron, but so far, 
			they've had no response. Until 
			they've had a chance to speak with 
			him, we've been ordered not to get 
			involved.

					KIRA
			The Bajoran government has agreed 
			to abide by the decisions of the 
			Federation Council.

					BASHIR 
			So this means we're not going to 
			warn the Cardassians?

					DAX
			The Klingons are still our allies. 
			If we warn the Cardassians, we'd 
			be betraying them.

					O'BRIEN
			Besides, what if the Klingons are 
			right? What if the Dominion has 
			taken over the Cardassian 
			government?

					ODO
				(backing up O'Brien) 
			If my people wanted to seize 
			control of Cardassia, that is how 
			they'd do it.

					KIRA
			The coup could've happened just as 
			easily without the Founders. The 
			Cardassian dissident movement's 
			been gathering strength for years. 
			And with the Obsidian Order out of 
			the way, they might've finally 
			succeeded.


     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT FOUR    54.

67   CONTINUED:

	Worf looks up. He speaks with the simple certainty of 
	someone who's analyzed the situation and knows the 
	truth.

					WORF  
			The issue is not if there are 
			Founders on Cardassia.

	All eyes turn to Worf.

					WORF 
			There are many Klingons who say we 
			have been at peace too long. That 
			the Empire must expand to survive. 
			Fear of the Dominion only gives my 
			people an excuse to do what they 
			were born to do. To fight. And 
			to conquer.

	This is exactly what Sisko's been thinking.

					SISKO 
			If they're so eager to fight, 
			who's to say they'll stop with the 
			Cardassians.

					KIRA
			Their next target could be 
			anyone... even the Federation.

					DAX
			If I were you, I'd be more worried 
			about Bajor.
				(to everyone) 
			Think about it. What good does it 
			do for the Klingons to defeat 
			Cardassia, if they don't control 
			the wormhole?

					WORF
				(agreeing) 
			If my people return to the old 
			ways, no one will be safe.

					SISKO
			Then we've got to make sure that 
			doesn't happen.

					O'BRIEN
			How? The way I see it, we've only 
			got two choices, both of them bad. 
			If we stand by and do nothing, we 
			risk becoming the Klingons' next target.

67   CONTINUED:	(2)


					O'BRIEN (Cont'd) 
			But if we disobey Starfleet's 
			orders and warn the Cardassians, 
			we may end up starting a war with 
			the Klingons.

					SISKO
			Which means we need a third 
			option.

	And as they look at Sisko expectantly...

									CUT TO:

68   INT. GARAK'S SHOP

	Garak is saying good-bye to Morn, who is carrying a 
	package.

					GARAK 
			Trust me, you won't regret this. 
			When it comes to keeping warm, 
			nothing beats Vitarian wool 
			undergarments. 
				(a beat) 
			And in case you change your mind

	As Morn nods and EXITS, Garak's com-line CHIRPS.

					SISKO'S COM VOICE 
			Mister Garak, I'd like to see you 
			in the wardroom immediately. And 
			bring your tailor's kit.

	And off Garak's puzzled reaction...

69   INT. WARDROOM 

	Garak ENTERS, carrying a small case. He's surprised to 
	see the assembled senior staff.

					DAX
			All together, we're talking about 
			well over a hundred ships, just in 
			the first wave ...

	Dax trails off as she sees Garak ENTER the room.

					GARAK 
			I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

69   CONTINUED:


	Sisko stands up.

					SISKO
			I'd like to be measured for a new suit.

					GARAK
				(surprised) 
			Now?

					SISKO
			Right now.

					GARAK 
			But captain, I have your 
			measurements--

					SISKO
				(cuts him off) 
			Take them again.
				(and as Garak complies) 
			You were saying, Commander?

					DAX
			I was saying that between ground 
			forces and warships, the Klingons 
			have committed almost a third of 
			their military to this invasion.

					SISKO
				(to Worf) 
			How long until they reach their 
			target?

	Worf looks at Garak uncomfortably. He's not sure he 
	agrees with Sisko's solution to their problem.

					WORF
			According to our estimates, the 
			task force will enter Cardassian 
			space within the hour.

70   CLOSE ON GARAK

	As his whole body tenses in reaction to what he's just 
	heard.

					SISKO
			Don't forget the waist. I think 
			I've lost a little weight.

	Hold on Garak. He's trying to keep a poker face, but 
	he knows what he has to do.

70   CONTINUED:

					GARAK 
			Thank you, Captain. I think  
			I have everything I need.

71   INT. GARAK'S SHOP (OPTICAL) 

	Garak is talking to DUKAT on a portable communications 
	device. He's just given Dukat the news and Dukat looks 
	dumbfounded.

					DUKAT 
			The Klingons? Why would the 
			Klingons invade us?

					GARAK 
			According to my sources, the 
			Klingon High Council believes that 
			Cardassia has been taken over by 
			the Founders.

					DUKAT 
			That's ridiculous..

	Garak looks skeptical. For all he knows, Dukat could 
	be a Founder.

					GARAK 
			Is it?

	Dukat pauses. He wonders too.

					DUKAT 
			Garak, you've got to talk to 
			Sisko. Tell him he has to find a 
			way to stop the Klingons. 
			Cardassia has enough problems 
			right now.

					GARAK 
			Having trouble keeping the 
			civilians in line?

					DUKAT 
			How do you know about that?

					GARAK 
			I'm afraid after the fall of the 
			Obsidian Order, Cardassian 
			security isn't what it used to be.

					DUKAT
				(sarcastic) 
			Yes. Shame about the Order. I 
			suppose there won't be much of a 
			demand for clandestine services 
			anymore. Looks like you'll be 
			hemming women's dresses for the 
			rest of your life.

71   CONTINUED:


					GARAK 
			We can sit here all day reminding 
			ourselves of how much we hate each 
			other. But you don't have the 
			time. The Klingon fleet will 
			reach Cardassian territory in less 
			than an hour. So I suggest you 
			get ready for them.

	And with that, Garak cuts off the transmission. He

	for Dukat.

73   INT. OPS (OPTICAL)

	Kira, Dax, and Worf are gathered around the Ops Table, 
	looking at a display in the middle of the table (where 
	the station diagram usually is.) The display is a map 
	of the Cardassia/Bajoran border. The graphics show 
	that the Cardassian systems closest to the border have 
	been overrun by the Klingons. In the b.g. we can see 
	Sisko talking to someone (we don't see whom) on his 
	desk monitor.

					KIRA
			Based on Klingon transmissions 
			we've intercepted, the outlying 
			Cardassian colonies were overrun 
			almost immediately. But now that 
			the Cardassian fleet has 
			mobilized, the Klingons are 
			meeting stronger resistance.

					DAX
				(dry) 
			You'd almost think someone warned 
			the Cardassians they were coming.

					KIRA
			Hopefully this will make the 
			Klingons think twice about what 
			they're doing.

					WORF
			Unlikely, Major. Now that the 
			battle has begun, Martok and his 
			troops will settle for nothing 
			less than victory.

74   NEW ANGLE 

	As Sisko ENTERS from his office. There's a pregnant 
	pause, and then O'Brien says what's on everyone's mind.

					O'BRIEN  
			Well, what did the Federation 
			Council say?

					SISKO
			They've decided to condemn the 
			Klingon invasion.

	Everyone reacts. They're not surprised, but they know 
	this may mean trouble.

					SISKO 
			In response, Gowron has expelled 
			all Federation citizens from the 
			Klingon Empire and recalled his 
			ambassadors from the Federation.

					KIRA
			You're saying he's cut off 
			diplomatic relations?

					SISKO
			He's done more than that. The 
			Klingons have withdrawn from the  
			Khitomer Accords. The peace 
			treaty between the Federation and 
			the Klingon Empire... has ended.

	And as the senior staff reacts to this grave announcement ...

75   NEW ANGLE

	On O'Brien, who is still at his station. During the 
	above, he sees something on his monitor and goes to 
	check it.

					O'BRIEN
				(off monitors) 
			Captain, you're never going to 
			believe this ...
				(off reactions) 
			A Klingon ship just decloaked off

					WORF 
			Chancellor Gowron. You wished to 
			speak with me?

	Worf's expecting trouble, but to his surprise, Gowron

					GOWRON 
			Worf, it is good to see you.

	Gowron gives Worf a Klingon embrace.

					WORF
			It seems you were right. But I

				(dismissive) 
			Yes, yes. I know you did what you

			though you may have made some 
			enemies, I assure you I am not one 
			of them.

	Worf is surprised and relieved.

					WORF 
			I'm glad. Your friendship means 
			much to me.

					GOWRON 
			And yours to me. It has been too 
			long since you last fought at my 
			side. But now the time has come 
			again. We will do great deeds in 
			the coming days. Deeds worthy of

77   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE (CONTINUOUS)

	Gowron waits for Worf's response to his offer. Worf 
	wants to go, to redeem himself in the eyes of his 
	people, but in the end, he knows he can't.

					GOWRON
			Worf, why do you stand there like
			a mute d'blok. I have offered you 
			a chance for glory. All you have 
			to do is take it.

	Worf knows what his decision has to be.

					WORF 
			If there is glory to be won, it 
			will have to be yours alone. I... 
			cannot come with you, Gowron.

	Gowron is taken aback. He didn't expect this.

					GOWRON 
			Of course you can. It is where 
			you belong.

					WORF
			I cannot abandon my post.

					GOWRON 
			You no longer have a post. You

			no business wearing that uniform.

					WORF
			I have sworn an oath of allegiance--

					GOWRON
				(cuts him off, with 
				contempt) 
			To the Federation.

	Worf can't believe what Gowron is asking of him.

					WORF 

			You would have me break my word?

	Gowron is every bit as surprised by the direction of 
	this conversation as Worf. These are two men who 
	considered themselves friends realizing that they have

			they are without honor. And you

					WORF
			It is not what I owe them that 
			matters. It is what I owe myself. 
			Worf, son of Mogh, does not break 
			his word.

	But taking the high ground only makes Gowron more furious.

					GOWRON 
			And what of your debt to me? Are 
			you saying you owe me nothing? I 
			gave you back your name, restored 
			your house, gave your family a 
			seat on the High Council. And 
			this is how you repay me?

					WORF
			It is true that I owe you a great 
			debt. I would give my life for 
			you. But invading Cardassia is 
			wrong. And I cannot support it.

	Gowron goes cold. He sees that Worf will not be 
	swayed, but he wants to make sure that Worf understands 
	the consequences of his actions.

					GOWRON 
			Worf, I've always considered you 
			a friend and an ally. And because

79   INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL 

	Worf sits alone by the railing of the second level of

	departure of the Klingons, the place is back to its old 
	self, noisy, boisterous and raucous. But Worf takes
	no joy from his surroundings.

					O'BRIEN
			How could I forget? That was

			Truth is, there were a couple of 
			moments when I thought we were all 
			going to wind up "assimilated."

					WORF
			I never doubted the outcome. We

					O'BRIEN

	O'Brien smiles at Worf, but the Klingon is unable to 
	muster up a grin in return. O'Brien senses something 
	is wrong and looks questioningly at Worf. After a 
	beat, Worf looks up, meeting O'Brien's gaze.

					WORF 
			I have decided to resign from 
			Starfleet.

					O'BRIEN
			Resign? What are you talking about?

					WORF
			I have made up my mind. It is for 
			the best.

					O'BRIEN
			Look, I know how much you miss the 
			Enterprise, but I'm sure they'll 
			be building a new one soon.

	But to O'Brien's surprise, this doesn't seem to be a 
	factor in Worf's decision.

					WORF 
			It will not be the same. 
				(a beat) 
			The Enterprise I knew is gone. 
			Those were good years, but it's 
			time for me to move on.

					O'BRIEN
			And do what?

					WORF
			I don't know. I thought I would 
			be returning to Boreth. But now, 
			that's impossible. I have made an 
			enemy of Gowron, and of every 
			other Klingon in the Empire.

					O'BRIEN
			All the more reason to stay in 
			Starfleet.

					WORF
			This uniform will only serve as a  
			reminder of how I have disgraced 
			myself in the eyes of my people. 
				(thinking) 
			I suppose I could get a berth on 
			a Nyberrite Alliance Cruiser.

			The Nyberrite Alliance. That's a

				(a beat)
			What about your son?

	If anything, this makes Worf even more melancholy.

					WORF 
			Alexander is much happier living

			than he ever was staying with me.
				(a beat) 
			One thing is certain, the sooner

	O'Brien frowns thoughtfully, but before he can reply, 
	a jovial Quark comes up to the table.

					QUARK
			Do you hear that, Chief? Seventy-

	Quark's not about to let O'Brien bring him down.

					QUARK
			You want quiet, go to the 
			Replimat. This is Quark's the way

				(a beat) 
			Am I glad we finally got rid of

	Worf bristles.

					QUARK
			Present company excepted, of

	But Worf doesn't even bother replying. He just gets up 
	and walks away.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Quark) 
			I got to hand it to you, Quark 
			You really know how to make your

	O'Brien also gets up and walks away, leaving Quark

			Ah, what do I care? All he ever

81   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

	Worf and Sisko are in mid-conversation, Worf having 
	just revealed his decision to resign. Sisko studies 
	Worf for a beat, then...

					SISKO 
			I'm sorry Mister Worf, but I can't 
			accept your resignation at this 
			time.

	This isn't what Worf was expecting. In his mind, he's 
	screwed up and he thought Sisko would be eager to get 
	rid of him.

81   CONTINUED:

					WORF 
			I don't understand. What further

					SISKO
			I'm not sure yet. But as long as 
			the fighting continues between the

			need you here on the station.

					WORF
			If you think that is wise.

					SISKO 
			I don't know if it's wise or not. 
			But I do know you're a good

	Just then, Kira ENTERS.

					KIRA
			Captain, we just got word from

					SISKO
			How long until they reach 
			Cardassia Prime?

					KIRA
			Fifty-two hours.

					WORF
			If the Klingon Empire has reverted 
			to its old practices, they will 
			occupy the Cardassian homeworld, 
			execute all government officials, 
			and install an imperial overseer 
			to put down any further 
			resistance.

	Sisko thinks this over for a beat. For him, this is 
	not an acceptable outcome.

					SISKO
				(to Kira) 
			I think it's time we talk to the

					DUKAT 
			Captain, I'm a little busy at the

					SISKO
			Dukat? I was trying to reach

					DUKAT 
			And you succeeded. You're 
			speaking to the new Chief Military 
			Advisor to the Detepa Council.

					SISKO
			Does this mean you've turned your 
			back on the Central Command?

					DUKAT 
			It means that as a loyal officer 
			of the Cardassian Military, I'm 
			pledged to serve the legitimate 
			ruling body of the Empire. 
			Whoever that may be.

					SISKO 
			In other words, you saw which way

					DUKAT 
			It seemed like a good idea at the

					DUKAT
			That's a very generous offer,

					KASIDY
			Oh, hell.

	She wraps her arms around him and they kiss. It's a

			Really?

					O'BRIEN

	Sisko gets up and makes his way to a nearby monitor.

102   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	To include Gul Dukat on the monitor. Sisko and Dukat's 
	conversation lacks any of the veiled threats and 
	innuendoes that usually mark their interactions. These 
	are two professional soldiers in the middle of a war 
	and they're speaking quickly and precisely.

					DUKAT 
			I must compliment you, Captain. 
			You're nearly Cardassian in your

	In the background we hear the phasers fire.

					SISKO
				(no time for chit-chat)

					SISKO
			Prepare to evacuate. We'll begin 
			beaming you over as soon as 
			possible.

	The Defiant rocks from more weapons fire.

					DUKAT
			You'll have to drop your shields 
			to use your transporters.

					SISKO
			Let me worry about that. Sisko out.

	Suddenly the ship is hit by an especially powerful 
	blast. The Tactical station sparks and the Weapons
	Officer is thrown to the deck, badly injured.

103   CLOSE ON WORF

	Who instantly replaces the Weapons Officer at Tactical 
	as Sisko returns to the Captain's chair.

					SISKO
				(wants to make sure Worf 
				knows what he's doing) 
			Mister Worf?

					WORF
			Weapons ready, Captain.

	They look at each other for a beat, then Sisko nods.

					WORF
			Sir, restricting our fire to their 
			engines has not proven effective.

	In other words, Worf thinks they'd better shoot to 
	kill.

					SISKO 
			Very well. Target at your 
			discretion.


        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - 07/07/95 - ACT SIX       84.

	Garak ENTERS Quark's and looks around. The bar is 
	subdued and much emptier than usual. Many of the 
	civilians have evacuated, and the ones that are left 
	aren't in Quark's. Basically the only people in the 
	bar are off-duty Bajoran and Starfleet officers. 
	They're doing more talking than drinking, and no one is 
	playing dabo or any of the other games.

	Quark is at the bar, looking miserable. Garak 
	approaches him.

					GARAK
				(to Quark) 
			Might I trouble you for a glass of 
			kanar?

	Quark reaches under the counter and pulls out a bottle 
	of the Cardassian beverage. He sets it in front of 
	Garak.

					QUARK 
			Help yourself. It's on the house.

					GARAK 
			That's uncharacteristically

     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Way... Warrior" - REV. 08/01/95 - ACT SIX    89A.

118A   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			I'm in an uncharacteristic mood. 
			Besides, I've got eighty cases of
			this stuff sitting in my

			going, I'll never unload another 
			bottle unless it's to you.

					GARAK 
			How thoughtless of me never to

			destruction of my homeworld would 
			have on your business. These must 
			be trying times for you.
				(a beat) 
			Be brave.

	Quark nods.

					QUARK 
			I should've listened to my cousin Gaila. 
			He said to me, "Quark, 
			I've got one word for you... 
			weapons." No one ever went broke 
			selling weapons. But did I take 
			his advice... No. And why not? 
			Because I'm a people person. I 
			like interacting with my 
			customers. Like you and I are 
			doing right now. Talking to each 
			other, getting to know one 
			another...

					GARAK
				(sarcastic) 
			I can see the attraction... for 
			you.

					QUARK
				(ignoring him) 
			But when you're dealing in 
			weapons, buyers aren't interested 
			in casual conversation. They just 
			want their merchandise... no 
			questions asked. It's so 
			impersonal.

					GARAK 
			Your charms would be wasted.

					QUARK 
			Exactly. So now Gaila owns his 
			own moon, and I'm staring into the 
			abyss.

					GARAK 
			I know precisely how you feel.

	Quark suddenly gets an idea.

					QUARK 
			Here, I want you to try something 
			for me.

	Quark pulls out a glass and fulls it with a foamy brown 
	liquid.

					QUARK 
			Take a sip of this.

	Garak looks skeptically at the drink.

					GARAK 
			What is it?

					QUARK 
			A human drink. It's called root 
			beer.

					GARAK
				(eyes it suspiciously) 
			I don't know...

					QUARK 
			Go ahead. Aren't you just a 
			little bit curious?

	Garak hesitates a beat, but then takes a sip. He 
	immediately makes a face.

					QUARK 
			What do you think?

					GARAK 
			It's vile.

	Quark is glad that someone agrees with him.

					QUARK 
			I know.
				(searching for bad things to say) 
			It's so bubbly and cloying and

					GARAK 
			It's insidious.

					QUARK 
			Just like the Federation.

	There's a long beat as the two aliens share their 
	common bond.

					GARAK 
			Do you think they'll be able to

130   INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR

	Federation security teams armed with phaser rifles take 
	up firing positions outside the airlock.

131   INT. PROMENADE (OPTICAL)

	As the last station resident EXITS the Promenade, the 
	airlock doors roll closed and a forcefield winks on, 
	sealing them shut. The Promenade is now deserted 
	except for Bajoran deputies armed with rifles standing 
	guard.

	From the Infirmary, Bashir scans the empty Promenade.

132   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR

	Garak hurries down the corridor. We follow him until 
	we reach Dukat and two Starfleet security officers, 
	armed with phaser rifles.

					DUKAT
			That's close enough, Garak.

					GARAK 
			I just wanted to make sure the 
			council members were safe.

132   CONTINUED:

					DUKAT 
			Hoping, no doubt, that your concern 
			would curry political favor?

					GARAK
				(sarcastic) 
			Oh, and I take it your concern for 
			the council members is motivated 
			strictly by patriotism.

					DUKAT 
			The council members are well aware 
			of my patriotism. And the 
			sacrifices I was willing to make 
			in order to save them. Now why 
			don't you go back to your tailor 
			shop and sew something?

					GARAK 
			Because if the Klingons do invade 
			the station, you just may need my 
			help.

	And with that Garak takes out a small Cardassian 
	disruptor. At the sight of an armed Garak, Dukat 
	readies his own weapon.

					GARAK 
			Who would've thought the two of us 
			would be fighting side by side?

					DUKAT 
			Just be sure when you fire that 
			thing you're aiming at a Klingon.

					GARAK 
			I'll try to keep that in mind.

133   INT. OPS

	Close on O'Brien's hand, as he takes a phaser and

	Martok looks a little taken aback, but before he can 
	respond Gowron steps forward from the shadowy interior 
	of the Klingon bridge.

					GOWRON
				(on viewscreen) 
			It is of no consequence. All that

					SISKO
			I'm aware of that. But maybe 
			you're not aware of what you're 
			risking. We've had a year to 
			prepare this station for a 
			Dominion attack. And we're more 
			than ready.

	There's a beat, and then Gowron laughs.

					GOWRON 
			You are like a toothless old 
			Grishnar cat, trying to frighten 
			us with your roar.

					SISKO
			I assure you, this old cat isn't 
			as toothless as you think. Right 
			now, I've got five thousand photon

			launch. If you don't believe me, 
			feel free to scan the station.

	Martok turns to a Klingon officer on his bridge, who 
	nods.

					MARTOK
				(to Gowron) 
			It is a trick. An illusion

					SISKO
				(calm)
			It's no illusion.

					GOWRON 
			We shall see.

138   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	The Klingon fleet sweeps down on DS-Nine. We follow a

140   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

	As the lead ships continue to strafe the station, 
	suddenly Deep Space Nine opens fire.

	Sisko wasn't bluffing. O'Brien and his crews have been 
	busy over the past three years. When we came here, DS-
	Nine may have been a defenseless hull, but it's not that 
	way anymore.

	From weapon arrays situated all around the station, 
	swarms of photon torpedoes lash out at the Klingon 
	ships, finding their targets with deadly accuracy.

142   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The station unleashes a massive concentration of phaser 
	fire, which rips into the already heavily damaged 
	Klingon fleet.

	This is a display of firepower that far exceeds the 
	capabilities of any starship. Deep Space Nine is the 
	first line of Federation defense, and it's been armed 
	for bear.

143   INT. OPS	143

	As everyone reacts to the destruction.

148   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	A Klingon Boarding Party MATERIALIZES in Ops. Worf is 
	on his feet even before the Klingons are fully

	one of the Klingons to the deck.

	Sisko and Kira aren't far behind. Kira fires, striking

	On Odo, who ducks under the swing of a Klingon's 
	bat'leth, then counterattacks, knocking out the 
	Klingon. Unfortunately, a second Klingon is right on

	Dukat and Garak stand shoulder to shoulder, in front of 
	he doorway leading to the Cardassian council members. 
	They are brawling with four Klingon warriors. Dukat 
	and Garak are both cut up and bleeding. The two 
	Federation officers lie on the ground, dead, along with 
	two or three Klingons.

	Somehow, Dukat has gotten hold of a bat'leth and he's 
	hacking at two Klingons. Garak's struggling with a 
	Klingon, but suddenly his opponent is hurled into a 
	bulkhead. Garak's shot him in the stomach with his 
	disruptor.

					GARAK 
			All this hand-to-hand combat is 
			really quite distasteful.

	As Dukat tries to fend off the two Klingons, Garak 
	fires at an off-screen target.

154   INT. OPS

	Close on Dax, as she uses her Klingon martial arts to 
	subdue her opponent. Behind her, Kira gets stabbed by 
	a Klingon, but she manages to take him out before she 
	slumps to the deck.

155   NEW ANGLE

	As a Klingon nails O'Brien, but his triumph is short-
	lived. Worf launches into the Klingon with a salvaged 
	bat'leth, hitting him with an impressive combination of 
	blows. The Klingon is overwhelmed.

156   CLOSE ON WORF

	As he turns around, looking for another foe, but the 
	only people standing in Ops are Sisko and Dax. Kira is 
	on the ground, holding a knife wound in her side. 
	Sisko has a cut on his forehead. They all look a 
	little worse for wear.

	Worf immediately sits down and begins firing the 
	station's weapons. As does Dax, who takes Kira's 
	place.

157   NEW ANGLE

	Sisko helps O'Brien back to his feet.

					SISKO

	Which shows Gowron and Martok on the bridge of the 
	Negh'Var.

					GOWRON
				(on Viewscreen) 
			Captain, your shields have been

			and more Klingon ships are on the 
			way. Surrender while you can.

					SISKO
			I don't think so. My shields are

			have been contained, and my 
			reinforcements are closer than 
			yours.
				(a beat) 
			Gowron, you're facing a war on two 
			fronts. Is that what you really 
			want?

					WORF 
			The Klingon Empire isn't strong

			the Cardassians. End this now, 
			before you lead the Empire to its 
			worst defeat in history.

					MARTOK

					SISKO (Cont'd)
				(a beat)  
			This is exactly what the Founders

			Cardassian... Federation against 
			Klingon. The more we fight each 
			other, the weaker we'll get, and 
			the less chance we'll have against 
			the Dominion.

					WORF 
			Consider what you do here, Gowron. 
			Kahless himself said, "Destroying 
			an Empire to win a war is no 
			victory."

	This gives Gowron pause. The whole campaign isn't 
	working out the way he thought it would.

					GOWRON
				(finishing the quote) 
			"And ending a battle to save an 
			Empire is no defeat."

	Martok isn't so ready to give up.

					MARTOK
				(on viewscreen,

			But we can still win.

					SISKO
				(to Martok) 
			Not before those starships get 
			here.
				(to Gowron) 
			Now, what do I tell them? To 
			stand down... or come in firing?

	Gowron thinks it over for a long beat, then seems to 
	come to a decision.

					GOWRON
				(on viewscreen) 
			It is we who shall stand down.

					MARTOK
				(on viewscreen, objecting) 
			Ach Gowron, yay chol... (But 
			Gowron, victory is near.)

				(to Sisko) 
			But let your people know, the

	The door CHIMES.

					WORF
			Enter.

	Sisko ENTERS, carrying a PADD, which he hands to Worf.

					SISKO 
			I brought your discharge papers.

	Worf looks at the PADD.

					SISKO 
			I understand you're headed for the    
			Nyberrite Alliance.

					WORF (nods) 
			I leave this afternoon.

	There's nothing in Worf's manner that even suggests 					he's looking forward to his trip.

					SISKO       
			I finally realized it wasn't

			I thought I could just wrap the

			them both away.
				(a beat) 
			But it doesn't work like that. 
			Running may help for a little 
			while, but sooner or later the 
			pain catches up to you. The only 
			way to get rid of it is to stand 
			your ground and face it.

					WORF 
			But wearing the uniform must 
			remind you of what you've lost.

					SISKO
			Sometimes. But it also reminds me 
			of what I've gained. And who I 
			am. I could throw away my 
			uniform, resign my commission, run 
			all the way to the Nyberrite 
			Alliance, and it wouldn't make any 
			difference.
				(a beat) 
			A Starfleet officer. That's what 
			I am, and that's what I'll always

	This touches a nerve with Worf. He looks down at the 
	folded uniform.

					WORF
			And you think that's true of me 
			as well.

					SISKO
			What's important, Mister Worf, 
			is what you think.

165   CLOSE ON WORF

	Worf looks at the uniform for a long beat.

			you all to know... I just spoke to 
			Dukat and several members of the 
			Detepa Council. They've returned 
			to Cardassia Prime without 
			incident and asked me to convey to 
			you their personal thanks.

					KIRA 
			Who would've thought I'd help save 
			the Cardassian government?

					ODO
			Don't worry... I'm sure Dukat will 
			take all the credit.

					BASHIR 
			Poor Garak. Dukat's a hero, and 
			Garak is still stuck in his 
			tailor shop hemming trousers.

			Captain, I'm receiving a priority    
			one message from Starfleet    
			Intelligence.


				(concerned) 
			The Klingons are refusing to give

			colonies they seized during the 
			invasion. They're fortifying 
			their positions and deploying 
			orbital defense systems.

					KIRA 
			Looks like the Klingons are here 
			to stay.

	There's a moment of tension as everyone reacts to 
	this disquieting bit of news.

			Maybe they are... But so are we.

	And off this moment, we ...
