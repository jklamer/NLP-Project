As do I.	The crew is celebrating its successful return from 	another mission and the Mess Hall is fuller and louder 	than we've ever seen it. our people have faced 	hazardous duty daily, and when they return to safety, 	the pressure of their situation demands release.	Nog has set up a makeshift BAR, complete with BOTTLES 	and GLASSWARE, and he's using the skills he learned in 	his uncle's establishment to mix elaborate drinks. He 	picks up a TRAY of DRINKS, and we FOLLOW him as he 	crosses to --     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - TEASER     2.3    OMITTED3A   SISKO, DAX AND BASHIR	sitting at a table. As he serves them three tumblers 	of brandy:					NOG			Here you are...	Sisko looks at the drinks, surprised and pleased.					SISKO			How'd you get your hands on			Saurian Brandy?					BASHIR			In the middle of a war, no less.					NOG			It's a busy Starbase.				(smiles)			I may be a cadet, but I'm still a			Ferengi.					DAX				(raising her glass)			Lucky for us.	Nog moves off with the tray, crossing past the door, 	which OPENS to admit O'BRIEN. He's carrying an empty 	CANISTER about three feet long. He approaches Sisko's 	table to present it to him. When the crew sees him, 	they start to gather around to watch.					O'BRIEN			Excuse me, captain.	When Sisko sees the canister in O'Brien's hand, he 	immediately knows what it is and what is expected of 	him. Our people are about to act out what has become 	a ritual of sorts.					O'BRIEN			The power cell from the phaser			array, sir. We used it up on the			last mission.	Sisko takes the cannister, holds it out for everyone to 	see.					SISKO			Take a good look at this, people.			It says something about this ship.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - TEASER     3.3A   CONTINUED:					SISKO (Cont'd) 			It says that we're willing to 			fight -- and that we'll keep on 			fighting until we can't fight 			anymore.	Everyone in the room answers in unison --					ALL 			Yes, sir!					SISKO			You don't just throw something 			like this away.					ALL 			No, sir!	Sisko looks over at the wall, where SIX other 	CANISTERS form a row of trophies. As Sisko moves over 	to place the cannister next to the others, the crew 	breaks into cheers and applause.	It's a rousing moment, and only Nog notices the door to	the Mess Hall OPENING behind them to admit ADMIRAL 	ROSS.					NOG 			Admiral on deck!	The room falls silent as everyone turns to stand at 	attention.					ROSS 			As you were.	The mood relaxes a bit as people move to talk to each 	other, but the din in the room is noticeably quieter. 	Sisko moves to join Ross. He's been serving under him 	ever since the crew's rescue in "Rocks and Shoals," and 	the two men have developed a close relationship based 	on mutual respect.					ROSS				(as Sisko approaches) 			Ben.					SISKO 			Admiral.					ROSS 			Let's take a walk.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - TEASER    3A.3B   INT.

They've done a 			hell of a job.					SISKO			Thank you, sir.	Sisko smiles at his friend...					SISKO			But you didn't come here to tell 			me that, did you?	Ross smiles, gets to the point of his visit.					ROSS			No, I didn't. Ever since this war 			began, the Dominion's been able to 			outmaneuver us at every turn. No 			matter where we send our ships, 			they always seem to be there 			waiting for us.					SISKO				(dry) 			I've noticed that.					ROSS				(smiles) 			It's almost enough to make you 			think they're smarter than we are. 				(off Sisko's smile) 			But they're not. They've just had 			an edge we didn't know about until 			yesterday. Starfleet Intelligence 			located a massive sensor array 			hidden on the periphery of the 			Argolis cluster. The damn thing 			can monitor ship movements across 			five sectors.					SISKO			That's how they've managed to stay 			one step ahead of us.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - TEASER     4.3B   CONTINUED:					ROSS 			They've had an enormous tactical 			advantage.

QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL (OPTICAL)	where we find KIRA and ROM near the railing, looking 	down at the crowd on the First Level. Rom slowly wipes 	down a table, pretending to work so he can watch.	There's a group of CARDASSIAN SOLDIERS at the Dabo 	table, gambling and having a good time. BAJORAN 	SUPERNUMERARIES sit at various tables, their mood a bit 	subdued by the Cardassians in their midst. JEM'HADAR 	SOLDIERS stand here and there, implacably watching the 	proceedings but not joining in.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - TEASER     5.5    CONTINUED:	QUARK, along with a few FERENGI WAITERS, is scrambling 	to serve the customers.					ROM 			There he is.	Below, we see DAMAR, Gul Dukat's right hand man, ENTER	from the Promenade.					KIRA			Damar's a creature of habit, all 			right.	Damar moves to an open space at the bar near THREE 	CARDASSIANS.					KIRA				(sarcastic) 			After a hard day's work, he 			deserves his glass of kanar.	Damar barks and order to Quark -- we see his lips move, 	but can't hear him from this vantage point. Quark 	hurries to get a bottle -- while he waits, Damar 	glances around, scowls at the Jem'Hadar in his midst.					KIRA			Why are the Jem'Hadar always in 			here, he asks himself. They don't 			eat, they don't drink, they don't 			gamble -- all they do is take up 			space.	As Quark pours Damar a drink, Damar asks him something.					KIRA			Damar asks his bartender if he 			found a PADD he was working on the 			other day. He misplaced it, he 			wants it back.	Quark shakes his head, shrugs.					ROM 			My brother tells the truth, he 			hasn't seen it.	Damar accepts Quark's word, drinks his Kanar.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - TEASER     6.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			Damar doesn't like that. The PADD 			contained a draft copy of a secret 			memorandum he was working on 			concerning the shortage of White. 			Without the drug, the Jem'Hadar 			will run amok, killing everyone 			and everything in their path. If 			the Cardassians can't bring down 			the minefield and re-open the 			supply line from the Gamma 			Quadrant, they're planning to 			poison the last ration of White 			and eliminate the Jem'Hadar before 			it's too late.				(beat, to Rom) 			How did you get hold of Damar's 			PADD, anyway?					ROM				(modest)			I'm good with my hands.	Rom gestures to a table of THREE JEM'HADAR sitting 	nearby, glaring at Damar.					ROM				(with anticipation) 			Here we go... they've seen him.	After a beat, the JEM'HADAR THIRD motions for the 	others to follow him. Kira and Rom watch as the group 	of Jem'Hadar come to a stop a few yards behind Damar. 	The Third says something to Damar, but again, we don't 	hear it. When Damar turns to face him, the Third barks 	an accusation, pulls out a CARDASSIAN PADD.					KIRA			The missing PADD.	Damar knows immediately what it is, he makes an angry 	accusation.					KIRA				(smiles knowingly) 			He thinks they stole it.	The Jem'Hadar bristles at Damar's retort --					ROM			The Jem'Hadar didn't like that...	The Third points at a nearby table --     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - TEASER     7.5    CONTINUED:	(4)					KIRA				(to Rom) 			Why's he pointing at that table?					ROM 			Because that's where he found it. 				(pleased) 			Right were I left it.	As they watch, the exchange grows more heated -- nearby 	Cardassians stand and move to Damar's side, ready to 	join in if there's trouble.					KIRA 			I knew this was going to work. 			The Cardassians and Jem'Hadar may 			pretend to be allies, but they 			hate each other.	Not knowing what he's getting into, Quark moves to try 	to diffuse the situation. Damar roughly shoves Quark 	aside, sending him flying across the bar. Rom winces --					ROM 			Ow.	Suddenly Damar and the Jem'Hadar Third lunge at each 	other. A split second later, their men do the same. 	Patrons scramble to get out of the way. We CUT DOWN to 	the first level as chaos erupts -- after a few vicious 	swipes at each other, a Jem'Hadar pulls his KNIFE and 	slashes a Cardassian.	Some Cardassians out on the Promenade realize what's 	happening and rush in -- seeing that their comrades 	are no match for the Jem'Hadar, a Cardassian pulls his	RIFLE and FIRES at a Jem'Hadar inside, killing him in 	a burst of SPARKS. Another Jem'Hadar swings around 	with his own weapon and FIRES back.	As the situation escalates, Kira and Rom react -- this 	is bigger than they expected.

QUARK'S - MINUTES LATER	The rioting has been brought under control; ODO has his 	BAJORAN DEPUTIES keeping the JEM'HADAR and CARDASSIANS 	separated. Some of them are battered and bloodied, and 	we see the bodies of THREE DEAD CARDASSIANS and TWO 	DEAD JEM'HADAR.	Broken tables and chairs litter the area, some SCARRED 	by phaser fire. In the background, BAJORAN MEDICAL 	PERSONNEL are tending to THREE INJURED BAJORANS. Quark 	is being led out the door by an N.D. NURSE.	WEYOUN is dressing down the Jem'Hadar Third. Across 	the way, a furious DUKAT is talking to a chastened 	Damar.					DUKAT				(quiet rage) 			I don't care what they did. 			You shouldn't've let the situation get 			out of hand.	There's nothing Damar can say to defend himself. 	Disgusted with him, Dukat crosses away to join Odo in 	the center of the room. He looks down at the bodies of 	his dead men with controlled rage. As Weyoun turns 	away to join Odo and Dukat, he stares the Third down 	coldly.					WEYOUN			You're reduced six ranks.	The Jem'Hadar drops his head in obeisance. As Weyoun 	moves to join the others, he barely registers the body 	of the dead Jem'Hadar. He's more concerned about the 	implications of what happened here -- he knows the 	Cardassian/Dominion alliance is rocky, and he's worried 	about what this incident could do to relations.					WEYOUN				(quiet) 			How could Damar have been so 			stupid as to leave such an 			inflammatory document lying around 			for anyone to find?					DUKAT				(anger rising) 			Your men stole it from him.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT ONE     9.6    CONTINUED:					WEYOUN 			The Jem'Hadar are not thieves.					DUKAT 			And Damar is not a liar.7    ODO	catches a glimpse of Rom on the Second Level, peeking 	in from behind the crowd of onlookers. Odo's eyes 	narrow as he realizes that the Resistance Cell is 	behind what happened -- he's none too happy about it, 	and when Rom sees the look on his face, he ducks out of 	sight.8    RESUME					WEYOUN				(to Dukat) 			Keep your voice down. Our men 			need to see that we're still 			allies. Smile.	Weyoun forces a smile, looks around at the gathered 	faces as if everything's all right. It's a convincing 	show, but when he turns to Dukat, he sees a less-	convincing smile snarled on his features. Warning him 	to do better --					WEYOUN				(still smiling) 			Dukat.					DUKAT				(through his clenched 				smile) 			I'm smiling.					ODO 			Gentlemen, I suggest we get 			everyone out of here as soon as 			possible.					WEYOUN 			Odo's right. Tell your men 			they're confined to quarters 			pending disciplinary hearings.	Dukat bristles at being told what to do, but before he 	can object --					WEYOUN 			I'll do the same.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT ONE    10.8    CONTINUED:	Dukat backs off --					WEYOUN 			And keep smiling.	Dukat repaints a smile on his face, glances around at 	his men as if everything's all right.

STARBASE - ADMIRAL ROSS' OFFICE	This is a minor redress of Sisko's office as seen in 	"A Time to Stand." The basic configuration is the 	same, but some of Ross's personal items are on the 	walls.	Sisko is giving Ross his attack plan, referring to a 	STARCHART on the WALL MONITOR. The array is located 	at the edge of the Argolis Cluster, across from where 	Starbase 375 is located.					SISKO			-- according to Intelligence, the 			array is capable of detecting 			cloaked ships as far away as two 			light years.	Sisko indicates the star chart, showing Ross how a ship 	might leave the Starbase and swing around the Argolis.					SISKO 			By the time the Defiant got around 			the Argolis Cluster, the Dominion 			would already know we were coming.					ROSS				(grim) 			You'd have a dozen Jem'Hadar ships 			on you before you even got close.					SISKO			We need to have the element of 			surprise on our side -- it's the 			only way.					ROSS 			What are you suggesting?	Sisko knows how this is going to sound --    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT ONE    11.9A   CONTINUED:					SISKO 			That I take the Defiant through 			the Argolis.					ROSS 			You can't take a ship through 			there... you'd be cut to pieces by 			the gravimetric shear.					SISKO			That's exactly what the Dominion 			thinks. But if we came at them 			from the Argolis, they wouldn't 			know what hit them.					ROSS 			What makes you think you can get 			through?					SISKO			Dax says she can navigate around 			the gravimetric distortions -- 			she's studied proto-star clusters, 			she knows what to look for.	Ross wants to believe it can be done -- he badly wants 	the array destroyed.					SISKO				(continuing) 			It's a gamble. But it's one I'm 			willing to take.	Ross considers for a beat, makes his decision.					ROSS 			All right. Let's give it a shot.			When can you leave?					SISKO			As soon as we've finished repairs 			on the Defiant.					ROSS 			Keep me posted.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT ONE    12.9A   CONTINUED:	(2)	Ross dismisses him with a nod, turns to his desk 	monitor.

SECURITY OFFICE	where Odo is pacing behind his desk when Kira ENTERS.					KIRA			You wanted to see me?	Odo is angry with her, but he's playing it close to the 	vest. He looks at her as if he's expecting her to 	apologize to him. After a beat.					ODO			Well?				(off her blank look) 			Don't you have something to say to 			me?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT ONE    13.12   CONTINUED:					KIRA				(unsure) 			You mean about what happened in 			Quark's?				(off his nod) 			It worked better than I expected.	Odo was hoping to hear an apology, and when he doesn't, 	he launches into her.					ODO			I knew you were behind it.					KIRA			Of course you did. We discussed 			it at the last Resistance meeting.					ODO			And I said it was a bad idea.					KIRA			Yes, you did.				(annoyed at the memory) 			And then you walked out of the 			room as if there was nothing more 			to say. But Rom and Jake stayed 			and we discussed it. And you know 			what? I decided it was a good 			idea.					ODO				(incensed) 			So you went ahead and did it 			behind my back?					KIRA			Why are you taking it so 			personally?					ODO			How do you expect me to take it? 			I spend my days sitting on the 			Council with Dukat and Weyoun, 			doing what I can to make sure 			Bajor survives this war intact. 			The last thing I need is to have 			you running around causing mayhem.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT ONE    14.12   CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO (Cont'd) 			Do you have any idea what would 			happen if Dukat found out you were 			behind it? It would give him all 			the excuse he needs to throw every 			Bajoran off this station.					KIRA			The Federation is losing this war. 			We can't just sit by and do nothing.					ODO			There are limits to what we can 			do.					KIRA			I'm beginning to think you 			shouldn't have agreed to sit on 			that Council. It's as if you've 			gotten so invested in making sure 			the station runs smoothly, you've 			forgotten there's a war going on.	This hits Odo like a punch in the stomach. He rears up 	his dignity, asks her outright what she's saying.					ODO			Are you questioning my loyalties, 			Major?	This is so far from her mind that she doesn't even 	answer directly --					KIRA			I need you, Odo. The Resistance 			needs you.	But this isn't good enough for him.					ODO			Answer me. Are you questioning my 			loyalties?					KIRA			Of course not.

Outside on the Promenade, 	we see TWO JEM'HADAR guards take up position on either 	side of the door. Kira is surprised by her unexpected 	appearance, but Odo is positively stunned.

SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 	Kira can see that Odo is shaken by the Female 	Shape-shifter's unannounced arrival; the Major's crossed 	paths with her before, and she doesn't trust her. The 	Founder barely registers Kira's presence... all she cares 	about is Odo. Without looking at Kira, she calmly 	tells her to go.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			Leave us. I need to speak with 			Odo.					KIRA				(not impressed) 			Do you?	The Founder turns and looks at Kira for the first time; 	it's as if Kira's very presence tires her. Odo 	considers what to do for a moment, then gently lets 	Kira know what he wants.					ODO			It's all right, Nerys. I may as 			well hear what she has to say.	Kira's all but forgotten the argument she and Odo were 	just having -- right now, she's just concerned about 	her friend.					KIRA			Are you sure?	Odo nods that it's all right. Kira gives the Founder 	a last, "watch yourself" look, then turns and EXITS. 	Odo and the Founder study each other for a beat.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			You called her "Nerys."					ODO			What of it?					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			You used to call her "major." Using 			a Solid's name denotes intimacy.	Odo isn't about to let her dictate the conversation -- 	he has questions of his own.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT TWO    17.14   CONTINUED:					ODO			You're a long way from home. Here 			to keep an eye on the war effort?					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			I'm content to leave the details 			of the war to the Vorta.					ODO			Then what brings you to Deep Space 			Nine?					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			You.	Odo reacts -- given their past history, this is a 	potentially ominous remark.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			I was trapped here in the Alpha 			Quadrant when Captain Sisko mined 			the entrance to the wormhole. 			I've spent too much time among 			Solids. I came because I felt the 			need to be with one of my own.	Given their backstory, Odo can't believe what he's	hearing.					ODO				(sardonic) 			That's ironic, considering what 			happened the last time we crossed 			paths.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			You caused the death of a fellow 			changeling, Odo. Turning you into 			a Solid was the only punishment 			severe enough for your crime.					ODO				(incredulous) 			And now that I'm a changeling 			again, you come here as if nothing 			ever happened?					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER				(simply)			We've forgiven you.					ODO			Well I haven't forgiven you.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT TWO    18.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			It's time to put the past behind 			us.					ODO			What about the present? You're 			waging war against my home.	She looks at Odo sadly, realizing how little he 	understands.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			This isn't your home, Odo. You 			belong with your own kind... as 			part of the Great Link.	Odo had assumed that the Founders had passed final 	judgment on him when they turned him into a Solid. 	Suddenly the Link is being held out to him again, and	the thought holds great allure -- even so, he's not 	about to admit that to her now.					ODO			I'm quite content here, thank you.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER 			You say that because you don't 			know what you're capable of 			becoming.				(a gentle suggestion) 			Perhaps if we spend time together, 			you'll begin to understand.	Though he tries to hide it, Odo has a burning curiosity 	about his people. Satisfied that she's planted the 	seed of temptation, she turns and EXITS... leaving Odo 	with a lot to think about...15   EXT.

Why 			didn't you disable the alarm?	Odo turns to her, regards her with an almost Founder-	like serenity.   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/-97 - ACT FIVE   58.50   CONTINUED:					ODO			It's difficult to explain...	His calmness only stokes Kira's anger and frustration --					KIRA 			Rom is sitting in a holding cell 			being interrogated! He was 			counting on you. I was counting 			on you.					ODO			I know.					KIRA			You know!				(anger rising) 			Do you realize you handed the 			Alpha Quadrant to the Dominion?					ODO			I was in the Link.	Odo says this as if it were explanation enough...					KIRA				(disbelieving) 			Are you telling me you forgot?					ODO			I didn't forget. It just... 			didn't seem to matter.					KIRA			You know!				(incredulous) 			A lot of people are going to die -- 			don't you care?					ODO			It has nothing to do with me.					KIRA				(stunned) 			How can you say that?					ODO			If you could experience the Link, 			you'd know why nothing else 			matters.					KIRA			The last five years... your life 			here... our friendship -- none of 			that matters?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Behind the Lines" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT FIVE   59.50   CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO			It did... once.	She looks at him, realizing that everything she ever 	thought they had between them was a lie.					ODO				(saddened)			I wish I could make you			understand. But you can't.				(almost pitying her)			You're not a changeling.	Kira fixes him with a look --					KIRA			That's right. I'm a Solid.	She's letting him know that as far as she's concerned, 	they're on different sides now. Without another word, 	she turns and EXITS. We hold on Odo's face for a beat, 	then we hear the SOUND of a door opening and the Female 	Shape-shifter ENTERS from the back room.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER			You look troubled, Odo. Did she			upset you?	A beat as Odo considers it, then he realizes how he 	feels...					ODO			No... not really...	Off the Female Shape-shifter as she allows herself a 	small smile of triumph...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
