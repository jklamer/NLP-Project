Don't fade in; instead:									CUT TO:2    INT. PALLRA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	Muted lightning from candles, oil lamps.  A Bajoran woman 	(PALLRA) at a window... she's blonde, dressed entirely in 	white.  She opens the window as the lightning blinks lightly 	outside, takes a deep cleansing breath of the rain breeze...					PALLRA			I didn't kill him, you know.	She turns and looks toward us... and as the lightning flickers 	outside, half her body is illuminated as we see her face for 	the first time... and it takes our breath away.  She's the 	kind of woman men kill for.  Or die for.  She moves away 	from the window... it's hot... her skin shines vaguely like 	a rain-slicked street.  In another apartment, someone is 	practicing an alien instrument, (not electronic).  The music 	floats in the window -- a hauntingly romantic and yet 	disturbing melody with chromatic intervals... it is a theme 	that will haunt us throughout our story...					PALLRA			A lot of people believed it was me.  			That shape-shifter thought so.  But 			he was wrong.	She moves to a sofa where QUARK sits, sipping a drink, 	listening curiously... why the hell tell me?, his face seems 	to say.  Sexual tension fills the air.					QUARK			It was a long time ago.        DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/17/93 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					PALLRA				(nods, beat, not ready 				to get down to 				business)			Say what you will about the 			Cardassians... at least they could 			keep the power on... do you want 			more ice?					QUARK			I'm fine.	His eyes measure her... what does she want?					PALLRA			You were always very kind.					QUARK			Was I?					PALLRA			You made life a little easier.					QUARK			I ran a black market for anyone who 			could pay.  Never exactly thought of 			myself as... kind.					PALLRA			But there was a little extra ginger 			tea in the package you gave me, wasn't 			there...	They look at each other a long beat... she isn't wrong... 	they both know it...					QUARK			You didn't call me to Bajor to talk 			about tea.					PALLRA			I need a favor.					QUARK				(dry)			For old times sake.        DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/17/93 - TEASER        3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					PALLRA			That's right.					QUARK			I'm still as kind as ever.					PALLRA			I can pay you.					QUARK			I'm listening.	She rises, moves back toward the window... the breeze blows 	through her hair, moves through and under her dress...					PALLRA			My husband kept a strongbox in our 			shop on the station.  Buried in the 			wall.  I want you to bring it to me.					QUARK			What's in it...					PALLRA			Nothing anyone would value.					QUARK			Anyone but you.					PALLRA			Sentimental reasons.					QUARK			Why not take a sentimental journey 			back to the station... if it's your 			property...					PALLRA			I couldn't stand going back to that 			shop... where my husband was 			murdered...					QUARK			Or maybe you'd rather not let Odo 			see you there.					PALLRA			I'm sure he's forgotten about all 			that by now.	Quark smiles -- they both know she's lying.          DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - 09/16/93 - TEASER           4.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					PALLRA				(beat)			Can you neutralize the security 			system... ?	Quark nods.					PALLRA			I knew I could count on you.				(beat)			It's behind the panelled wall to the 			right as you enter.  Four panels 			in... and two up...					QUARK			Four in.  Two up.					PALLRA			I'll give you five bars of latinum.					QUARK				(uncertain)			Five... ?					PALLRA			And as always... my personal 			gratitude.	A beat as Quark studies her... the lightning flickers, she's 	irresistible... no matter how tough he plays it, he knows it 	and what's worse, so does she.  He nods, rises.					QUARK			A day.  Maybe two.	She smiles with promise.  He leaves.  A beat later, a heavy 	set, muscular man (TRAZKO) appears from the shadows of the 	other room.  Pallra glances at him with cold eyes... 	everything went exactly as planned.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/17/93 - ACT ONE        5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)3    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)	Establishing.4    INT. PROMENADE - LATE NIGHT	Seems deserted; all shops and other places sealed for the 	night; almost all signage shut off.  Dark and silent.  Finding 	the silhouette of ODO standing at his door, backlit, making 	one last look down the Promenade.  His voice over has the 	undertone of somebody who'd prefer not to be bothered --					ODO (V.O.)			Commence Station Security log.  			Stardate 47282.5.  At the request of 			Commander Sisko, I will hereafter be 			recording a daily log of law 			enforcement affairs.5    INT. SECURITY OFFICE	As Odo comes in, and begins to turn off consoles and lights...					ODO (V.O.)			The reason for this exercise is beyond 			my comprehension except perhaps that 			humans have a compulsion to keep 			records and lists and files... so 			many in fact that they have to invent 			new ways to store them 			microscopically.  Otherwise their 			records would overrun all known 			civilization.				(beat)			My own very adequate memory not being 			good enough for Starfleet, I am 			pleased to put my voice to this 			official record of this day: 			Everything's under control.

PROMENADE - POV OF THE SECURITY OFFICE	as the last light inside goes off...7    ANGLE ON QUARK & ROM					QUARK			Now.	They move stealthily along the side of the lower Promenade; 	flattening themselves as much as possible against the wall 	to avoid detection by any possible passersby.  ROM carries a 	satchel of lightweight tools over his shoulder.8    CLOSER - QUARK & ROM	looking every which way as they sneak along.  They'll speak 	in STAGE WHISPERS:					QUARK			When we get to the entrance, you 			stay flat against the wall.  It's a 			pulsatel lockseal.  I can get it to 			release in about twenty-five seconds.					ROM			Twenty-five seconds... but somebody 			will see us... let me do it...					QUARK				(scoffs)			You?  We'd be at it all night.					ROM			No, only about ten seconds.	Quark stops dead -- stares at Rom.					QUARK			How would you release a pulsatel 			lockseal in ten seconds?       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/22/93 - ACT ONE        7.8    CONTINUED:					ROM			You have one on the storeroom door.					QUARK			So?					ROM			Sometimes when you forget to leave 			me the desealer, I have to get the 			storeroom open.					QUARK				(deadly)			You've unsealed the storeroom without 			my knowledge?					ROM			Only to serve a customer's needs...					QUARK			In ten seconds?					ROM			You forget fairly often.	They're again moving surreptitiously to...8A   FRONTING SHIP'S STORE	Quark removes the satchel from Rom's shoulder -- will dig 	into it for something, as:					QUARK			Ten seconds.				(searching satchel)			We'll see how you handle this 			desealing rod.					ROM				(fishes in pocket)			That's all right; I have my own.					QUARK				(stops; gapes)			What?	Rom pulls forth a little penknife-looking gizmo -- which he 	opens to reveal a short strip of metal, having key-like ridges 	along both sides, and an icepick-like tip.       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/22/93 - ACT ONE       7A.8A   CONTINUED:					ROM			Nog made it for me.  Boy's always 			been clever with his hands.	Quark's now gaping at the open desealer.

SHIP'S STORE	as, from without, the front door-seal is broken open (just 	enough of a SNAP-CRACK Sound to tell us it's a break-in, 	rather than something being properly unlocked).  Quark and 	ROM sneak in, closing the door behind them.  Both take palm 	lights from the satchel.  This is a shop that sells and 	repairs techno gadgets that ships need.  There's a 	workbench... several gadgets and tools on display.  Throughout 	the above:					QUARK				(accusatory hiss)			Thief.  Don't deny it.  You've 			been stealing from me...					ROM			Brother, I'd never...					QUARK			Tomorrow morning, I'm changing my 			entire lock system.       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/17/93 - ACT ONE        8.9    CONTINUED:	Quark moves to the wall to his right... it is a panelled 	wall, with multiple Cardassian duranium squares 	checkerboarding the wall.  Quark counts the squares as 	ordered...					QUARK			Four in... two up... here... it's 			behind this one...	Focusing on the right panel... attached at its four corners 	as by 24th century equivalent of screws.					QUARK			Keep an eye on the Promenade...	Quark again starts rummaging around in the satchel, pulls 	out a laser torch device as...					QUARK				(continuing)			... while I burn off the panel.					ROM			The glare could attract attention.  			I have a better idea.					QUARK			A better idea.	Rom reaches into the satchel...					ROM			I took the liberty of bringing along 			a small vial of magnasite drops...	He pulls it out...					QUARK			Magnasite drops?  What are magnasite 			drops?	Rom will take the container -- which looks exactly like an 	eyedrop bottle (including the eyedropper itself) and begin 	applying it to each of the four corner "screws" of the panel.  	As he's doing so:					ROM			A compound that will eat through 			duranium... one on each corner and 			the panel will fall off...       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/17/93 - ACT ONE        9.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK				(again, deadly)			How do you know that?	The four corners of the panel on which Rom has dabbed a bit 	of the magnasite drops from the dropper, now BEGIN TO SMOKE...					ROM				(still happily working)			When you were in the Gamma Quadrant 			overnight... we did very good 			business... naturally, I had to keep 			your profits safe.

Ever; 			ever; again.12   INT. QUARK'S (OPTICAL)	Closeup of the box.  Still very late at night.  A laser tool 	carefully unseals the strongbox.

CHEMIST SHOP	... It's five years earlier... as Odo ENTERS the shop.  His 	"attire" is different (appropriate to occupation times), but 	his face looks the same.  The doors don't, though... nor 	does the chemist's shop into which he's walked (alone).  	(NOTE:  Odo himself is, in this period, quieter, and with a 	far less open and decisive demeanor.  His eyes dart everywhere -- 	not through cunning, but due to uncertainty in these 	surroundings, and with these people.  This is an earlier Odo 	in personality as well as attire.  At this point, he's an 	outsider without status -- maybe even the neighborhood "freak" --  	and used to being treated as such.)					ODO			You asked to see me?23   FULL SHOT	We now see how the chemist's shop looked when this was the 	Bajoran Ghetto section of the Cardassian station: A sparsely 	supplied, ramshackled excuse for a shop.  Sprawled on the 	floor is the body of the Bajoran Chemist (who'll be referred 	to as Vaatrik)... covered with a sheet.  Sitting casually on 	a desk, drinking a cup of hot, steaming liquid, reading a 	PADD is GUL DUKAT, who looks up, gregarious.					GUL DUKAT			Yes, yes, please come in.  We've met 			before.  Gul Dukat.	Odo hesitantly shakes hands, glances at the sheet.  He doesn't 	like Cardassians any more than anyone else.					ODO			Have we?       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/22/93 - ACT TWO       19.23   CONTINUED:					GUL DUKAT			I don't expect you'd remember.  I 			was one of the guests at the 			reception.  At the Bajoran Center 			for Science... it must have been two 			years ago.					ODO			Ah yes, when the Cardassian High 			Command was invited to... view me.					GUL DUKAT			You were very amusing that night.					ODO				(dry)			Was I.					GUL DUKAT			You did a Cardassian neck trick that 			brought the house down.					ODO			The Bajoran scientist who worked 			with me thought you might find it 			entertaining.  He made me practice 			for weeks on the... Cardassian neck 			trick.					GUL DUKAT			Gul Hadar couldn't stop talking about 			it.  He wanted to send you out to 			entertain the troops.				(beat)			I, on the other hand, began to wonder 			if you couldn't provide a more 			valuable service to the Cardassian 			Empire.  I've stayed informed about 			you, Odo... since you walked out on 			your Bajoran keepers.					ODO			I simply felt I could learn more 			outside a laboratory.					GUL DUKAT			Yes, you've become something of a 			student of humanoid nature, haven't 			you...					ODO			Just what is it you need, Gul Dukat?       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/21/93 - ACT TWO       20.23   CONTINUED:	(2)	Dukat raises the sheet to show Odo the body.					GUL DUKAT			Ever seen a dead man before?					ODO			Yes.  In your mines.					GUL DUKAT			Those were casualties.  This is 			murder.  I've decided you're going 			to investigate it.					ODO			Me?  Why me?  I'm no investigator.					GUL DUKAT			But I have a suspicion you'd make a 			good one.  Shape-shifting your way 			into places the rest of us can't 			go...					ODO			I have no intention of being a 			Cardassian agent.	And it's said with such force that Dukat has to blink at the 	impertinence of it.  Odo stares at him and won't back off 	it.  Dukat controls himself, smiles.					GUL DUKAT			Not an agent.  An investigator.					ODO			There's a difference... ?					GUL DUKAT			We can't have these Bajorans running 			around, murdering each other.  I'm 			talking about order.  Justice.	Odo looks at him evenly.					ODO			There is very little justice in the 			Cardassian occupation of Bajor.       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/22/93 - ACT TWO       21.23   CONTINUED:	(3)					GUL DUKAT				(breaking character, 				harsh)			Don't push me, Odo.  My superiors 			would have me "solve" this murder by 			choosing ten Bajorans at random and 			executing them!  I am hoping you'll 			give me a better alternative.	Odo looks at Dukat evenly, is already beaten, knows it... 	waits for orders... a long beat, Dukat gets his mask back 	on...					GUL DUKAT			Now, these Bajorans won't talk to 			us... but they seem to trust you... 			I understand you used to sort out 			local disputes in some Bajoran village 			or other.					ODO				(slight nod)			Now and then.					GUL DUKAT			And as I've heard it, you do the 			same for our Bajoran laborers here 			on the station.  Petty disputes in 			the barracks over food, blankets, 			everyday things like that... They 			come to you.					ODO			I suppose I'm considered a neutral 			observer.					GUL DUKAT			Of course.  You're not one of them.  			And you should be thankful for it.  			So here's another petty dispute.  			Only this time I'm bringing it to 			you.  Find the murderer.	A beat... a surrender...					ODO			Are there any witnesses?       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/22/93 - ACT TWO       22.24   INT. STORAGE ROOM/SECURITY OFFICE - CLOSE ON PALLRA	Pallra is not as glamorous as we saw her in the future... 	but she's a handsome woman even in occupation clothes... in 	fact, her clothes are just a cut above the rest we've seen... 	she sits on one of two folding-type chairs... some crates 	still are around.  There should be a small computer that was 	probably used for inventory.					GUL DUKAT (O.S.)			Sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. 			Vaatrik.	Moving to find Dukat ENTERING with Odo.					GUL DUKAT			This is Odo.  He'll be investigating 			your husband's death.

My sympathies, Madame.	He bows to her and EXITS.  She looks to Odo.  After a long 	beat.					ODO			I'm sorry for your loss.					PALLRA			Thank you.	Odo searches for the right questions to ask.  Nothing comes 	natural to him here.					ODO			Do you have any idea who might have 			done this?					PALLRA			I have a very good idea.					ODO				(reacts)			You do...       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/22/93 - ACT TWO       23.24   CONTINUED:	(2)					PALLRA				(sighs)			May I be honest with you... ?					ODO			That might be helpful.					PALLRA			My husband was having an affair.  			Some girl came on the station about 			a week ago.  He was... infatuated 			with her, I don't know... Why are 			men like that?					ODO			Believe me, I have no idea.					PALLRA			We had two wonderful years together... 			until she arrived and now...				(sighs, angry, shaking 				her head)					ODO			You loved him very much.					PALLRA			Of course I did.					ODO			Then, perhaps you might explain 			something I don't understand.					PALLRA			What's that?					ODO			Mister Vaatrik was found dead two 			hours ago.  Mrs. Vaatrik hasn't shed 			a tear.					PALLRA				(about to deny)			What makes you think...					ODO			By necessity I'm an observer, Mrs. 			Vaatrik.  When a humanoid cries, the 			epidermis below the eyes swells 			noticeably.

So you were about to 			accuse this other woman of the murder, 			I believe...	And Pallra who's played this scene in her mind several times 	has had her entire rhythm thrown off by Odo's approach... 	she tries to regain her balance...					PALLRA			He had confessed his indiscretion to 			me days ago but said it was over...       DEEP SPACE: "Necessary Evil" - REV. 09/17/93 - ACT TWO       24.24   CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO			And when he broke it off with her, 			she killed him in a jealous rage.					PALLRA			Something like that.					ODO			Do you know her name?					PALLRA			No, but I can point her out to you.	Odo nods, she rises and they EXIT to...25   INT. PROMENADE GHETTO AREA	A wire-like fence in immediate f.g. separates the (o.s.) 	Cardassian part of the Promenade from the part -- which we're 	now seeing beyond the fence -- that is the Bajoran ghetto.  	It's the equivalent of the Warsaw Ghetto of WWII.  No lights 	to mark the few little open shops; only cold, hungry, ragged 	Bajorans sitting in open doorways, or trudging wearily to 	and from their back-breaking labors; no color to anything; 	no hope of anything.  Odo and Pallra EMERGE from the chemist's 	shop (just within the fence in f.g.), and head away from us 	through the dreary ghetto... past a small campfire...26   MOVING WITH ODO AND PALLRA					ODO			When was the last time you saw Mister 			Vaatrik alive?					PALLRA			At dinner.  He went back to the shop 			to do some inventory work afterwards.	She chokes on the last words...

A beat.58B  CONTINUED:					KIRA				(simply)			I just came by to wish you luck on 			Draylon Two.	Haneek nods sadly.					KIRA				(continuing)			Haneek, I still believe this is the 			best choice... for Bajor and for 			you.					HANEEK			And you believe we would have been a 			burden to your people...					KIRA				(a long beat)			Yes.					HANEEK				(nods; it's the answer 				she expected)			I think you've made a terrible 			mistake.  All of you.  Maybe we could 			have helped you.  Maybe we could 			have helped each other.  The Skrreeans 			are farmers, Kira.  You have a famine 			on your planet.  We might have made 			that peninsula bloom again.  We'll 			never know, will we?	Kira nods... tries to think of the right thing to say.					HANEEK				(continuing)			Fifty years of Cardassian rule has 			made you all frightened and 			suspicious.				(beat)			I feel sorry for you.58B  CONTINUED:  (2)  					HANEEK				(beat; coldly)			You were right.  Bajor is not 			Kentanna.	Haneek turns and enters the Skrreean ship, leaving Kira 	standing alone and feeling alone, as she ponders Haneek's 	last words...59thru   OMITTED67									FADE OUT.                        <U>END OF ACT FIVE</U>                                                     <U>THE END</U>
