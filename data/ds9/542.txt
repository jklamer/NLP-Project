INFIRMARY	where we find a harried BASHIR finishing up some work 	at his console. He works the controls for a beat, then 	picks up a PADD.					BASHIR			Computer, download file to PADD...				(checking its serial 				number) 			F-seven.	We hear the SOUND of the computer initiating the 	download.					COMPUTER VOICE 			Download complete.	Just as Bashir grabs another two PADDS and prepares to 	leave, a VOICE from the doorway --					ODO'S VOICE 			You're up late.2    NEW ANGLE	to reveal ODO standing in the doorway. Outside, we can 	see the relatively quiet Promenade.					BASHIR				(nods a greeting) 			I have a few things to finish up 			before I leave in the morning.	Odo gives him a curious look, and Bashir holds up the	PADD to explain --					BASHIR 			I'm presenting a paper at a 			medical conference.					ODO 			I see. Where is it? Risa, 			Casperia Prime?					BASHIR 			Casperia. How'd you guess?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					ODO 			Doctors always hold their 			conferences at sunny resorts.					BASHIR				(smiles) 			Ours can be a grim profession. 			Don't you think we deserve a break 			from all the illness and death?	Odo gives him a skeptical look --					ODO 			Don't forget to bring plenty of 			sunscreen.	As Odo turns away, we reveal a sheepish looking O'BRIEN 	standing in the doorway. He's wearing his kayaking 	WETSUIT and nursing an injured right shoulder.					ODO 			Let me guess. You dislocated your 			shoulder.	An embarrassed O'Brien nods, and Odo rolls his eyes 	before EXITING. O'Brien gives Bashir a beseeching 	look.					BASHIR 			Not again.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER        3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Bashir leads O'Brien over to the bio-bed. As he scans 	him with a TRICORDER --					BASHIR				(scolding him) 			You promised me you wouldn't go 			kayaking again until your shoulder 			had a chance to heal.					O'BRIEN				(chastened) 			I know. But I can't stay away.				(trying to explain 				himself) 			It's like the river calls to me.					BASHIR 			That's right. It's saying, "Stay 			away. Don't come near me. I'll 			only hurt you more!"	Before O'Brien can protest, Bashir wrenches his 	shoulder back into place -- we hear a POPPING SOUND and 	O'Brien lets out a howl of pain. A moment, then he 	lets out a relieved breath and gingerly tests his 	shoulder.					O'BRIEN 			Much better.	Bashir gives him a HYPO to the shoulder --					BASHIR 			It'll be tender for a few days so 			go easy on it.					O'BRIEN 			Right.	Bashir starts getting his things together so he can 	leave --					BASHIR 			If the pain starts to get any 			worse, Nurse Bandee can give you 			something.					O'BRIEN 			Thanks, Julian. Have a good time 			on Casperia.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER        4.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR 			I'm going to a medical conference, 			not on a vacation.					O'BRIEN			Whatever you say.					BASHIR				(at the door) 			Remember -- listen to the river... 			and stay away.	And with that, Bashir EXITS. Off O'Brien as he tests 	the pain in his shoulder... to his relief, he can use 	his arm fairly normally...3    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.4    OMITTED4A   INT. BASHIR'S BEDROOM	Bashir is asleep in bed when the Computer wakes him.					COMPUTER VOICE 			The time is oh-seven hundred hours.	Bashir groans, rolls over and opens his eyes. He idly 	scratches behind his right ear. (NOTE: This seemingly 	innocent gesture will eventually pay off in Act Five.)	His eyes are bleary and he feels as if he just fell asleep.					BASHIR				(unable to believe it) 			You're joking. Computer, 			confirm time.					COMPUTER VOICE 			The time is oh-seven-hundred 			hours, twenty-three seconds.	Bashir swings himself to a sitting position and yawns. 	Then he shakes his head, trying to clear it.					BASHIR 			Something tells me I'm going to 			need a lot of raktajino today.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER       4A.5    INT. BASHIR'S QUARTERS	as he ENTERS from the bedroom, now in uniform. He 	crosses to an open SUITCASE on the couch, tosses in a 	few last-minute items. He shuts the case, glances at 	his STUFFED BEAR, which is sitting on a nearby shelf.					BASHIR			See you in a few days, old chum.			Keep the home fires burning.	A COM VOICE interrupts --					COM VOICE			Attention, senior officers.			Report to Operations immediately.	Bashir sighs, a bit annoyed --					BASHIR			What now?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER        5.5    CONTINUED:	He grabs his case and heads for the door --6    INT. OPS	as the turbolift RISES into view carrying Bashir. He 	sees WORF, KIRA, DAX, O'Brien and Odo standing down by 	the Ops table. Armed N.D. STARFLEET INTERNAL AFFAIRS 	OFFICERS are at various consoles, downloading information.					BASHIR				(stifling a yawn)			This better be quick. I have a			transport to catch.	His demeanor changes when he sees the serious looks on 	the faces of his friends. His tiredness forgotten, he 	glances around and sees other INTERNAL AFFAIRS GUARDS 	stationed at strategic locations around Ops, HAND 	PHASERS strapped to their sides. (NOTE: Bashir's yawn 	and initial tiredness will pay off in Act Five, but 	from this point on, the seriousness of his situation 	will cause him to forget his fatigue.)	There's a definite tension in the room. Bashir moves 	to O'Brien's side, leans in close.					BASHIR			What's going on?					O'BRIEN			Internal Affairs.					BASHIR			What are they doing here?					O'BRIEN			They're not saying.					DAX				(trying to lighten the 				mood)			If they'd called ahead, we			could've thrown them a party.	Kira scans the sober faces of the guards --					KIRA			Something tells me this isn't a			social visit.					WORF			Where is the captain?					ODO				(motioning to Sisko's 				Office)			In there.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER        6.7    NEW ANGLE 	Through the door, our people can see a grim SISKO 	having a discussion with the head of the security team, 	Deputy Director SLOAN. Sloan cuts an impressive figure -- 	he carries himself with the confidence of a man who 	know what he wants and how to get it.					BASHIR			He doesn't look very happy.					ODO 				(grim) 			No. He doesn't.	As the senior staff watches, Sisko seems to acquiesce 	to some request of Sloan's. He motions toward the 	door, and follows Sloan out into Ops. A beat as our 	people wait to hear what he has to say.					SISKO 			All right, people. This is Deputy 			Director Sloan of Internal 			Affairs. He's here under the 			authority of the Federation 			Council. I expect you to give him 			your full cooperation.	Sloan steps forward. As he speaks, his eyes search the 	faces of the entire senior staff.					SLOAN 			Starfleet Intelligence has reason 			to believe that there's been a 			security breach aboard Deep Space 			Nine.	He lets this statement sink in for a beat before 	continuing.					SLOAN 			It appears that someone has been 			passing information to the 			Dominion.	Our people can't believe what they're hearing -- Dax is 	the first to object to this allegation.					DAX 			With all due respect, I think 			there's been some kind of mistake.					SLOAN 			I hope you're right, commander. 			I really do.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER       6A.7    CONTINUED:					SLOAN (Cont'd) 			But until we determine the source, 			we have to follow standard 			containment procedures and isolate 			the members of the senior staff.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER        7.7CONTINUED:	(2)	We can see that Sloan means this. He doesn't like 	accusing Starfleet officers of treason, but at the same	time, he's determined to get to the bottom of this.					SISKO 			As of now, you're all relieved of 			duty and confined to quarters.					KIRA				(incredulous) 			Confined to quarters?					SISKO			I don't like it any more than you do.	Our people exchange looks, but what can they do?					SLOAN 			You'll be contacted shortly. I'll 			be conducting interviews with each 			one of you. For the time being, 			you're not to discuss this matter 			amongst yourselves.				(beat) 			Any questions?	After a beat, Bashir asks --					BASHIR 			Do you have any idea how long your 			investigation is going to take?					SLOAN 			It's difficult to say, doctor. 			But don't worry, we've already 			contacted Starfleet Medical and 			informed them that you won't be 			attending your conference.	Bashir and the others react -- this guy seems to know 	a lot about them already.					BASHIR				(dry) 			How very considerate of you.	If Sloan catches Bashir's tone, he doesn't seem to 	care. He turns and nods to his Security forces --       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - TEASER        8.7    CONTINUED:	(3)					SLOAN			Take them to their quarters.	Lieutenant KAGAN, a young male, and Lieutenant 	CHANDLER, a stoic female -- step down to escort our 	people. They're professionals with a job to do and no 	hard feelings.

BASHIR'S QUARTERS	Bashir is pacing back and forth, mulling over what 	happened in Ops. He knows in his heart that Starfleet	Intelligence is wrong in its suspicions, and he's 	frustrated that a pointless investigation ruined his 	trip to Casperia. Finally, he stops pacing and crosses 	to the REPLICATOR, intent on getting something to eat.					BASHIR 			Hot buttered scones, moba jam and 			red leaf tea. 9   THE REPLICATOR	fails to respond. Bashir gives it a light bang with 	his hand. Nothing happens.					BASHIR			What's wrong with this thing?	He lets out an irritated breath, glances around for 	something to occupy his time. His eyes settle on his 	SUITCASE and he decides to unpack. He takes the case 	to a table, opens it, and starts to remove its 	contents. First he removes a STYLUS, which he sets on 	the table, then he withdraws the three PADDS he packed 	earlier. As he sets them down next to the stylus, he	inadvertently knocks it --10   TO THE FLOOR 	As he bends to look for the stylus the door CHIMES, and 	he decides to retrieve the implement later.					BASHIR 			Come in.	The door OPENS to reveal Lieutenant Chandler. Her 	weapon is slung.					CHANDLER 			Would you please come with me, 			doctor?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT ONE      10.10   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Certainly.11   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR	as Chandler and Bashir ENTER and start down the 	corridor.					BASHIR			Where are we going?					CHANDLER			To the wardroom. Director Sloan			wants to ask you some questions.	They round a corner, and suddenly, from the 	intersecting corridor, comes the SOUND of rushing 	FOOTSTEPS.					STARFLEET SECURITY VOICE (O.S.)			Stand clear --	Chandler grabs Bashir by the shoulder and shoves him 	over to the wall, clearing the path for --12   THREE STARFLEET INTELLIGENCE GUARDS	who run past with RIFLES at the ready. Bashir watches 	them hustle down the corridor and around a corner, out 	of sight.					BASHIR			What's going on?					CHANDLER			Nothing you need to worry about,			sir.	Bashir finds her explanation less than satisfactory, 	but clearly she intends to say no more.					CHANDLER			This way.	With a last glance down the corridor through which the 	guards disappeared, Bashir starts away, his features 	troubled.13   INT. WARDROOM	as the door OPENS and Chandler escorts Bashir into the 	room.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT ONE      11.13   CONTINUED: 	Sloan is seated at the table studying one of an 	assortment of PADDS arrayed within his reach. He looks 	up and nods to Chandler, who EXITS.	Sloan studies Bashir for a beat, then sets down his 	PADD and rises. Sloan has his jacket open and looks 	much more relaxed than in his previous scene. He 	approaches Bashir and extends his hand.					SLOAN			Doctor Bashir.	Bashir shakes the offered hand. Sloan is all smiles 	and hospitality. He's sizing Bashir up as a suspect, 	but hides his real agenda behind an affable facade. 	Only later will we discover the real motivations behind 	his innocuous questions and remarks.					SLOAN 			Have a seat.	Bashir seats himself in the indicated chair.					SLOAN 			I'm sorry you had to miss your			medical conference, but it 			couldn't be helped. In a case 			like this, I have to follow strict 			procedures.	Bashir's surprised by Sloan's warm and casual manner 	and it throws him a little off balance.					BASHIR			Of course. I understand.					SLOAN				(returns to his seat) 			Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.				(a wry smile) 			The last time you tried to attend 			a medical conference you were 			taken prisoner by the Dominion.					BASHIR				(nods) 			An experience I wouldn't care to 			repeat.					SLOAN 			I'm sure you wouldn't. Five weeks 			in a Dominion prison camp -- I 			can't imagine what it must've been 			like.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT ONE      12.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR 			It wasn't pleasant.					SLOAN 			I read your report.				(with a hint of 				admiration for Bashir's 				fortitude) 			It made me ask myself how I 			would've held up under those 			conditions. I guess you never 			really know until you go through 			it.					BASHIR 			I'm sure you would've found a way 			to cope. We do what we have to to 			survive.	Sloan smiles as if in agreement and picks up a PADD.					SLOAN 			I was just reading some of your 			case reports. Fascinating stuff. 			The work you did with those 			genetically enhanced patients? 			Very impressive.	Sloan's manner is such that Bashir finds himself 	starting to relax in his presence --					BASHIR			Thank you.					SLOAN				(smiles) 			Before you started working with 			them, they were described by 			Starfleet Medical as --				(checking PADD)			-- "alienated, uncommunicative,			and hostile." You're the first			doctor who managed to establish a			dialogue with them.					BASHIR 			Well, I think the fact that I'm 			genetically enhanced myself made 			them more open to accepting me.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT ONE      13.13   CONTINUED:	(3)					SLOAN				(enthusiastically) 			You spoke their language.					BASHIR			Exactly.					SLOAN			I envy your profession. You make 			a positive impact on people's 			lives.				(almost rueful) 			You know, I considered becoming a 			doctor myself.					BASHIR			You have a good bedside manner.				(off Sloan's look) 			When I walked in here, I was half 			expecting to be interrogated under 			a bright light.					SLOAN				(laughs) 			Not this time.	They share a smile. With a last glance at a PADD,	Sloan sits back.					SLOAN 			Well, I don't see a need to 			trouble you any longer. Thank you 			for your cooperation.					BASHIR			My pleasure.	Without alerting Bashir, Sloan activates a control that 	OPENS the door behind the Doctor.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT ONE      14.13   CONTINUED:	(4) 	Bashir stands and turns to discover Lieutenant Chandler 	waiting in the doorway for him.					SLOAN 			Lieutenant Chandler will take you 			back to your quarters. I'm afraid 			I'm going to have to ask you to 			stay there until I've finished the 			rest of the interviews.					BASHIR 			In that case, could you send 			someone to have a look at my 			Replicator? It isn't working.					SLOAN 			Actually, we took them off-line.					BASHIR				(surprised) 			Oh?					SLOAN 			To prevent anyone from trying to 			replicate a communications device 			or a weapon.	This strikes Bashir as a bit much, but he decides not 	to say anything.					BASHIR			All I want is some breakfast.					SLOAN				(picking up a STYLUS) 			What would you like? I'll have it 			sent to your quarters right away.					BASHIR 			Hot buttered scones, moba jam and 			red leaf tea.	Sloan jots this down and smiles, playing the waiter --					SLOAN 			Coming right up.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT ONE      15.13   CONTINUED:	(5)					BASHIR			Thank you.	Bashir turns and heads for the door. Just as he 	reaches it, Sloan calls him back.					SLOAN			Doctor. One more thing.					BASHIR			Yes.					SLOAN			About those genetically enhanced			patients of yours. Did Starfleet			Medical ask you to work with them,			or did you volunteer?					BASHIR			I volunteered.	Bashir isn't sure why this is important, but Sloan 	notes it on his PADD.					SLOAN			I see, very good.	Bashir nods, and EXITS to join Chandler.14   INT. BASHIR'S QUARTERS	where Bashir is sitting on the couch with his feet 	propped up, waiting for his breakfast. After a beat, 	the door CHIMES.					BASHIR			Yes.	The door OPENS to reveal Lieutenant Kagan carrying a 	TRAY of food.					KAGAN			Here you are, sir.					BASHIR			Thank God. I'm famished.	Bashir stands and takes the tray from Kagan.					BASHIR 				(thanks)			Cheers.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT ONE     15A.14   CONTINUED:					KAGAN 			Enjoy.	Kagan EXITS. Bashir takes the tray and sets it on his 	coffee table. He unfolds his napkin, then lifts the 	COVER off the plate with relish. But instead of the 	breakfast he ordered, he's been given --       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT ONE      16.15   A PLATE OF LIVE GAG'H	A startled Bashir recoils from the UNDULATING 	TENTACLES, quickly closes the cover over them.					BASHIR			Ugh. It's a little too early for			gag'h.	He picks up a small NAME CARD sitting on the tray, sees -16   WORF'S NAME	printed there, and realizes they made a mistake.					BASHIR				(annoyed)			I hope you like scones, Worf...	Disappointed to not have anything to eat, Bashir 	decides to get some work done. He crosses to the table 	to get his PADDS, but to his surprise, they're not on 	the table where he left them. Puzzled, he looks around 	until he sees his open --17   SUITCASE	There, sitting atop his still folded clothes, are the 	three PADDS.

He picks it 	up, a troubled look coming across his face as he 	realizes someone was in his quarters while he was gone.	He scans the room to see if anything else looks out of 	place. The CHAIR -- wasn't it facing the desk? The 	coffee MUG he drank from before he was called to Ops -- 	wasn't it a few inches closer to the edge of the table? 	His STUFFED BEAR -- wasn't it sitting a little more 	slumped when he saw it last?	Bashir barely has time to assimilate the fact that his 	quarters were searched when his COM-UNIT BEEPS.

WARDROOM 	as Chandler and Kagan escort Bashir into the room. 	Sloan is at the replicator, withdrawing a CUP of 	coffee, his jacket now closed -- the picture of a spit-	and-polish officer. He ignores Bashir's entrance. In 	a maneuver that the internal affairs team has practiced 	to well-oiled perfection, Chandler guides the doctor to 	a chair while Kagan takes a position near the wall 	behind him. The second everyone has settled in place, 	Sloan turns to face Bashir.					SLOAN 			Did you get your breakfast, 			doctor?	Sloan comes to a stop on the opposite side of the table 	and smiles expectantly at Bashir. Bashir senses Sloan 	is waiting for him to complain about the gag'h, and 	refuses to give him the satisfaction.						BASHIR 			Yes, I did.	Sloan studies him for another beat, then nods.					SLOAN 			Good.	Sloan sits down on the edge of the Wardroom table, 	effectively maintaining a dominant position relative to 	the seated Bashir. He picks up one of the many PADDS 	arrayed on the table and studies it while sipping his 	coffee.					SLOAN 			I was going over my notes from our 			last conversation and there are a 			few things I'd like you to 			clarify.					BASHIR			Oh?					SLOAN 			Do you have a problem with that?					BASHIR			Not at all.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT TWO      21.21   CONTINUED:					SLOAN 			Let's go back to the time you 			spent with the Dominion.					BASHIR			I wasn't "with the Dominion."

Five. Five days.					SLOAN				(frowns) 			That's odd. General Martok said 			you were gone for seven days.					BASHIR			Well, he's wrong. It was five.					SLOAN 			Why would he lie about something 			like that?					BASHIR			He's not lying.					SLOAN 			You can't both be right.					BASHIR			All I'm saying is that he must've 			lost count of the days.

They left you everything 			you needed to build a transmitter.	Bashir tenses. In this context, their escape does 	sound farfetched.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT TWO      25.21   CONTINUED:	(5)					SLOAN 			Isn't it more plausible that the 			Dominion wanted you to escape?					BASHIR			Why? For what reason?	Sloan's now behind Bashir, leaning over his shoulder as 	he speaks.					SLOAN 			So that you could start working 			for them.					BASHIR			I'm not working for them.					SLOAN 			How can you be sure?	This is such an odd question that it stops Bashir in 	his tracks --					BASHIR 			Excuse me?	But Sloan just repeats himself, more slowly this time, 	as if this were a perfectly reasonable question.					SLOAN 			How can you be sure that you're 			not working for them? Are you 			familiar with the term engramatic 			dissociation?					BASHIR			Vaguely.					SLOAN 			The theory holds that if a 			person's mind is sufficiently 			disciplined, he'd be capable of 			compartmentalizing contradictory 			information -- believing one thing 			while doing another.	Sloan starts to hammer home his case --       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT TWO      26.21   CONTINUED:	(6)					SLOAN 			I think you possess that kind of 			mind.

I 			need you to tear down the walls 			inside your mind and dredge up a 			fragment of memory -- anything 			about your mission, your contacts. 			I know it's not easy, but you've 			got to try.					BASHIR			There are no memories to dredge 			up.

He slams the PADD he was holding 	down on the table and vents the rabid hostility that he 	has so carefully concealed until this point.					SLOAN 			I've had enough of your lies, 			doctor.

Why, exactly, did you 			decide to work with them?					BASHIR			They'd been institutionalized most 			of their lives. I thought I might 			be able to help them assimilate 			into society.					SLOAN 			A laudable goal. But what I find 			puzzling is the way you went about 			it. These misfits had been 			sheltered from the outside world 			for as long as they could 			remember, yet you chose to bombard 			them with information about the 			war with the Dominion. Frankly, 			I'm surprised it didn't scare them 			into deeper isolation.	Bashir feels confident enough in what he did to go on 	the offensive --					BASHIR 			I was trying to engage them--- and 			it worked.					SLOAN 			Is that why you convinced 			Starfleet Command to give them 			access to classified battle plans?					BASHIR 			Starfleet was interested in 			hearing our ideas on how to win 			the war.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT THREE     34.27   CONTINUED:	(4)					SLOAN				(sardonic) 			How to win the war?

This was a	painful and still unresolved source of conflict between 	himself and his chief medical officer.					SISKO 			No.					SLOAN 			Of course not. No loyal Starfleet 			officer could.	Sloan's case is beginning to chip away at Sisko's 	certainty about Bashir's innocence -- though he 	continues to defend him, he doesn't have the same level 	of conviction we saw earlier.					SISKO 			I won't deny that Doctor Bashir 			has made some...				(choosing his words 				carefully) 			-- questionable decisions in his 			career, but you're a long way from 			convincing me he's a traitor.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT THREE     35.27   CONTINUED:	(5)					SISKO (Cont 'd) 			So far, your case is based on 			circumstantial evidence and 			speculation.					SLOAN 			What other kind of case can I make 			against a man who's covered his 			tracks so well?					SISKO			That's a circular argument and you 			know it.					SLOAN 			Captain, if Doctor Bashir had been 			involved in one or two 			questionable incidents, I can 			understand how you might be able 			to dismiss them. But the sheer 			number of incidents form a pattern 			of behavior that can't be ignored.	Sloan turns to face Sisko, and suddenly softens to a 	warm and sympathetic tone.					SLOAN 			I understand that you want to be 			loyal to a man who's served under 			you for so long. I understand 			that you're inclined to take his 			word over that of an outsider. 			But step back for a moment and 			think about it. This man 			concealed the truth about his 			illegal genetic enhancement for 			over thirty years. He lied to get 			his medical license. He lied to 			get into Starfleet. He lied to 			you when he came aboard this 			station and he's lied to you ever 			since.	This last salvo strikes Sisko personally -- in an area 	where he still holds resentments he's barely conscious 	of. But his sense of honor forces him to continue to 	defend Bashir, as much for his own sake as for the 	Doctor's.					SISKO 			He did eventually come forward and 			tell the truth.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT THREE     36.27   CONTINUED:	(6) 	Sloan plays this delicately, picking up on the 	unresolved dynamic between Bashir and Sisko, aware that 	heavy-handed grilling will demolish his work.					SLOAN			That's right, he did.

But the ends don't 			always justify the means.					SLOAN 				(calmly) 			Really? How many lives do you 			suppose you've saved in your 			medical career?					BASHIR 			I don't see what that has to do 			with anything.					SLOAN 			Hundreds... thousands?

But 			they didn't deny it either.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT FIVE      54.43   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO (Cont'd) 				(a beat) 			They simply said they'd look into			it and get back to me.					BASHIR			When?					SISKO			They didn't say.					KIRA			Sounds like a cover-up to me.	Bashir shakes his head in disbelief.					BASHIR 			Is it possible that the Federation 			would condone this kind of 			activity?					ODO			Personally, I find it hard to 			believe that they wouldn't. Every 			other great power has a unit like 			Section Thirty-one... the Romulans 			have the Tal Shiar, the 			Cardassians had the Obsidian 			Order...					BASHIR			But what would that say about us? 			That we're no different than our 			enemies? That when push comes to 			shove, we're willing to throw away 			our principles in order to 			survive?					SISKO 			I wish I had an answer for you, 			Doctor.					KIRA			Maybe we should do some more 			checking... try to track down 			Sloan ourselves.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Inquisition" - REV. 1/29/98 - ACT FIVE      55.43   CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO 			It won't be easy. If what he says 			is true, and Section Thirty-one 			has existed since the birth of the 			Federation... they've learned to 			cover their tracks well.					SISKO 			We don't have to find them. 			They'll come to us.	Everyone looks at Sisko.					SISKO				(to Bashir) 			You said Sloan wanted to recruit 			you.					BASHIR 			I turned him down.					SISKO			He doesn't strike me as a man who 			takes "no" for an answer.				(convinced) 			And next time he asks you to join 			his little group... you'll say 			"yes."	Bashir studies Sisko's face; the captain isn't joking.					BASHIR				(dry) 			I can hardly wait.					ODO			Congratulations, Julian. Looks 			like you're going to get a chance 			to play a spy after all.				(a beat) 			Only this time, for real.44   CLOSE ON BASHIR	as the thought begins to sink in.
