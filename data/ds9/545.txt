DAX, WORF, 	BASHIR and KIRA are seated at the table; ODO stands 	near the window. The mood is somber.					SISKO				(indicating the star 				map) 			-- the Dominion has solidified its 			hold on the Kalandra Sector. 			They're trying to establish a 			supply line running through 			Betazoid space into the Argolis 			Cluster.					WORF 			If they succeed, they would be 			able to launch an attack on 			Vulcan.					SISKO				(nods) 			Starfleet's going to try to cut 			them off near the Tibor Nebula. 			The Seventh Fleet will be engaging 			the enemy in the morning.					DAX			The Seventh Fleet is still at half-			strength. They took heavy losses 			at Sybaron.					SISKO			We'll just have to hope they can 			get the job done.				(beat) 			On a happier note, I do have a bit 			of good news.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 2/17/98 - TEASER      1A.Bl   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			That's a welcome change.					SISKO 			The Romulans have forced the 			Dominion to retreat from the 			Bolian System.	The senior staff break into enthusiastic WALLAH. Sisko 	smiles, gives them a moment to enjoy the good news. 	Then Odo chimes in with a sober observation.					ODO 			That is good news. The question 			is, will the Romulans be willing 			to leave Bolarus after the war's 			over?	This causes everyone to shift uncomfortably. Odo's 	raised a possibility that most of them would rather not 	think about.					ODO 			Once they capture territory, they 			rarely give it up.	Sisko privately shares Odo's concern, but he needs to	keep his people on track.					SISKO			Right now, we need to concentrate 			on beating the Dominion. We'll 			worry about the Romulans later.	Odo backs off with a shrug, but his point has clearly 	soured the moment of celebration.					SISKO			As some of you already know, Major 			Kira, Jake and I will be leaving 			for Bajor at twenty-two hundred.					DAX				(teasing them) 			There's a war on -- this is no 			time for a vacation.	Kira smiles, sets the record straight.					KIRA			The archaeologists excavating 			B'hala have found something they 			want the Emissary to see.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 2/17/98 - TEASER      1B.B1   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 			We'll be back tomorrow night.				(looks at his crew) 			That's all, people.	Everyone EXITS, except Kira and Odo.

He regards Kira	with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes -- it's a side 	of him we've never seen before, a side that Kira brings 	out when they're alone.					ODO 			Besides, everyone expects me to be 			dour and suspicious. I don't like 			to disappoint them.					KIRA				(smiles) 			If they only knew the real you.					ODO 			That is the real me.				(beat) 			At least as far as everyone else 			is concerned.	They share a smile. off this moment...Cl   EXT.

(NOTE: Could be substituted with a STOCK	MATTE of the planet's surface, maybe something from	"Rapture".)       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - TEASER      1C.1    INT. EXCAVATION TUNNEL	Ranjen KORAL, an old but vigorous Bajoran monk, leads 	Sisko, Kira and JAKE down a gloomy passageway cut 	through layers of reddish-brown SEDIMENT. The passage 	is lit every so often with makeshift LIGHTS, but there 	are nowhere near enough to make their PALM BEACONS 	unnecessary. Support BEAMS line the ceiling and the 	rough contours of the walls. Although a deeply 	religious man, Koral wears the practical work clothes 	of a veteran archaeologist.					KORAL				(glancing back at Sisko) 			I can't tell you how pleased we 			are by your visit, Emissary.					SISKO			I'm happy to be here, Ranjen.					KORAL 			There's no need to keep calling me 			"Ranjen." I'm a simple monk. My 			order is quite informal.					SISKO			You've certainly been busy. The 			last time I visited these ruins, 			none of these tunnels had been cut 			yet.					KORAL 			It's been a great deal of work, 			but we do it gladly. Excavating 			the Holy City is a privilege. Our 			efforts are an expression of our			faith in the Prophets... and in 			the Emissary.	Sisko accepts this with a gracious nod. Kira and Jake 	follow several paces behind. Kira notices that Jake is 	studying his father closely.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - TEASER       2.1    CONTINUED:					KIRA 			Something wrong, Jake?					JAKE				(sotto to Kira) 			No. It's just that Dad seems to 			be taking his role as the Emissary 			very seriously these days.					KIRA			You say that like you think it's 			a bad thing.					JAKE 			You have to admit, it's a long way 			to come to look at some old ruins.					KIRA			They've found what might be an 			important religious artifact in 			these "old ruins."					JAKE 			I hope so.				(re: the PADD in his 				hand) 			Otherwise I won't have much of a 			story.					KIRA			Try to look like you're enjoying 			yourself. Your father needs this. 			It's good for him not to have to 			worry about the Dominion for a few 			hours.2    ANOTHER PASSAGE OF TUNNEL	Koral rounds a corner and leads them down the passage. 	A movement in the shadows, the FLUTTER of wings in the 	darkness --					KORAL 			Don't let the bats bother you.	Jake pauses, nervously scanning the ceiling with his 	palm beacon.					KIRA				(over her shoulder) 			Don't worry, they rarely bite.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED:					JAKE.				(still scanning the 				ceiling) 			Rarely?	Jake notices the others have moved on without him and 	hurries to catch up.3    YET ANOTHER PASSAGE	Occasional sections of ancient STONE WALL are exposed 	in the sediment. Sisko idly runs his hand along the 	venerable structure.					KORAL 			We're directly below the Temple of 			B'hala. These walls predate the 			ancient city by ten thousand 			years.					JAKE 			Who built this place?					KORAL 			We don't know much about the 			original inhabitants, but it 			appears they abandoned this site 			some twenty-five thousand years 			ago. Over time, sediment buried 			the ruins.					JAKE				(catching on) 			And then B'hala was built on top 			of them.					KORAL 			Precisely.	Koral comes to a halt before the inky black mouth of a 	chamber. The others stop behind him.					KORAL 			In here...	A feeling of apprehension steals over them. Something 	about this place feels vaguely ominous.	Koral steps into the opening and is swallowed by the 	darkness. It's an eerie moment. Challenged and 	curious, Sisko follows, his light reaching into the 	bleak opaque void.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - TEASER       4.4    INT. CHAMBER	Koral switches on the portable TUBE LIGHTS along the 	floor. Like the tunnels, the ceiling is braced with 	BEAMS. Sections of the wall that once framed this room 	are visible through the sediment. In the center of one 	wall, an ancient stone TABLET is embedded in the stone.	Kira and Jake follow Sisko into the room, and Koral 	leads them over to the tablet. It's a vertical 	limestone oval, similar in shape to the symbol of Bajor 	on the temple entrance on DS9.					KORAL 			It's over thirty thousand years old...	Jake is less than thrilled, but Sisko looks closely at 	the tablet, which displays passages composed of ancient 	Bajoran RUNES. Parts of the inscription have been 	broken away or obscured by erosion and cracks.					SISKO 			These inscriptions, they look 			similar to ancient Bajoran, but I 			can't quite make them out.					KORAL 			Until recently, we couldn't 			either. But we've been able to 			piece together some rudimentary 			translations.	He points to a vertical strip of characters on the far 	right.					KORAL 			The syntax is unusual, but all 			forms of Bajoran share certain 			root-ideograms.				(taps one of them)			You may recognize this one.	Sisko leans in to get a better look.					SISKO			Welcome...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - TEASER       5.4    CONTINUED:					KORAL				(pleased)			Here's where it gets			interesting...	Koral's hand traces the two figures beneath, which are 	enclosed within an outline to form a distinctive 	CARTOUCHE. Sisko and Kira both react with recognition --					KORAL			I see you recognize it.	Jake doesn't, but he can see that Sisko and Kira are 	amazed by what they've read.					JAKE			I don't.					KIRA				(awed)			It says... Welcome, Emissary.	Jake stares at his father, drawn into the mystery as 	well.					KORAL				(to Sisko)			Now you know why I asked you here.	Jake regards his father with a look of "what next?" 	Sisko reaches out in wonder...5    HIS FINGERS	touch the cartouche. An AWESOME SOUND jerks us as we --									WHITE OUT TO:6    ANOTHER ANGLE - ALTERED REALITY (OPTICAL)	Sisko suddenly finds himself in the middle of the room. 	Similar to "The Emissary," and "Prophet Motive," we are 	in an altered reality, but in this case, we haven't 	left the room. The LIGHTS have changed COLOR and 	DIRECTION. Sisko tries to reorient himself and finds 	Kira, Koral and Jake are no longer where he last saw 	them.	They have become WORMHOLE ALIENS... cold and remote. 	They ignore Sisko completely -- as if he'd dropped 	unbidden into the midst of their discussion. 	Nevertheless, their statements bear some relation to 	his questions. Koral stands beside the stone tablet.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - TEASER       6.6    CONTINUED:					KORAL ALIEN			The Sisko has come.	A beat as Sisko realizes that he's dealing with the 	Prophets.

He will not			waver.	The Jake Alien considers it, then nods.					JAKE ALIEN			He is of Bajor.					KIRA ALIEN			He will bring the Reckoning.	Sisko turns to the Kira Alien.					SISKO			What is it you expect of me?	The Koral Alien arrives next to the Kira Alien.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - TEASER       7.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					KORAL ALIEN			It will be the end...					JAKE ALIEN			Or the beginning.					SISKO			I don't understand.					KIRA ALIEN			The Sisko will know.	The SCREEN WHITES OUT.									CUT TO:7    INT.

OPS	The Kai is standing alone by the control console, her 	eyes moist with tears.					COMPUTER VOICE			Chroniton levels at thirty-nine			kilanons and climbing...					WINN				(in a whisper)			May the Prophets forgive me...72   INT. PROMENADE (OPTICAL) 	The BLUE LIGHT is brighter now. Both combatants 	realize they must flee. Their eyes lock, and the 	columns of ENERGY roiling between them DISSIPATE. Jake 	looks at Kira... and smiles ominously. The Pah-wraiths 	have escaped destruction.	Suddenly TWO whirling vortexes of ENERGY (like the ones 	we saw in Scene 24) whip out of Kira and Jake and 	disappear into thin air --- the entities are gone.	Kira staggers backward, Jake collapses limply to the 	deck. Sisko rushes over to his son. Kira blinks and 	tries to focus her eyes as the Captain cradles Jake in 	his arms. The veins in his face have returned to 	normal, but he doesn't respond to Sisko's words.					SISKO 			Jake. Jake.	For a terrible moment it looks as if Jake might be 	dead, then the autonomic functions kick in and he draws 	a gasping breath.	Relief washes over Sisko and he pulls his son close, 	rocking him tenderly in his arms. Off this moment...73   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Ships return to the station. All is normal.74   INT. INFIRMARY	Bashir checks some readings on a PADD, looks up at 	Sisko.					BASHIR 			He'll be laid up for a few days, 			but he's going to be all right.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - ACT FIVE     52.74   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Can I see him?					BASHIR			For a minute.	Sisko moves to the bio-bed room and hesitates briefly 	at the entrance. Jake lies on the bio-bed, covered 	with a BLANKET. His eyes are closed and he looks very 	weak. Sisko gazes at his son from just inside the 	doorway. He rubs his temples, feeling guilty but 	terribly glad that Jake's alive. After a beat, Jake 	senses his presence and looks over.					JAKE			Dad?	Sisko takes a step forward.					SISKO			How're you feeling?	Jake manages a smile.					JAKE			Could be worse.	Sisko comes closer, wanting desperately to touch him, 	but feeling too guilty to do so.					SISKO				(trying to be upbeat)			You'll be up and about in no time.	A beat as Sisko looks for the right words, but can't 	find them.					SISKO			I don't know what to say.	Jake extends a hand from beneath the covers.					JAKE			Say you're happy to see me.					SISKO				(talking his hand)			You know I am.	A pregnant silence as Sisko struggles to say what's 	weighing on his conscience.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - ACT FIVE     53.74   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 			Jake, I want to try to explain 			what happened -- but I'm not sure 			I can.	Sisko closes his eyes, unable to look at his son...					JAKE			You don't have to explain.	Sisko stares into the clear and steady eyes of his son.					JAKE 			When the Pah-wraith was inside me, 			I could feel its hatred. And I 			knew that no matter what, it 			couldn't be allowed to win. Even 			if it meant I had to die.	Sisko's eyes are wet with tears.					JAKE			You did the right thing.	Jake pulls him close, just like his father's done for 	him so many times, and holds him... just holds him. 	Off this image...75   INT. PROMENADE	SUPERNUMERARIES are repairing the damage. Life is 	returning to normal. Kira ENTERS from the Temple and 	catches sight of Odo making his way past. They meet 	up.					ODO			How was the prayer service?					KIRA 			To tell you the truth, I wasn't 			paying that much attention. 				(off Odo's look) 			I guess I'm still trying to make 			sense of everything that happened.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - ACT FIVE    53A.75   CONTINUED:	Kira is clearly grappling with her experience, feeling 	a mixture of awe and loss.					KIRA 			Of all the people on this station, 			the Prophet chose me. I don't 			know why I deserved that honor.					ODO			Maybe that's why you were chosen. 			You have faith and humility.	Kira wants him to know something.					KIRA 			I heard that you told the captain 			I was willing to give my life to 			serve the Prophets. I appreciate 			that you respect my beliefs.					ODO 				(dry) 			Just the same, I wouldn't have 			minded if the Prophets had chosen 			someone else.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - ACT FIVE     54.75   CONTINUED:	(2)	Kira smiles and kisses Odo lightly on the cheek.					KIRA 			I have to go. I'll drop by 			Security after I take the Kai to 			her shuttle.	Odo watches her EXIT down the Promenade, just glad 	she's alive.76   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR	Kai Winn and Kira walk and talk on their way to the 	airlock.					WINN 			The Emissary couldn't escort me 			himself?					KIRA			He's with his son.	Winn mulls this over for a beat as they walk.					WINN 			I would've thought he'd want to thank me.					KIRA			For what?					WINN 			I prevented the destruction of 			this station. I saved the 			Emissary's life and the life of 			his son.	Kira stops dead and looks the Kai right in the face.					KIRA 			Don't pretend you did it for the 			captain.					WINN 			I did it for Bajor. If you 			haven't heard, the floodwaters 			have receded and the earthquakes 			have stopped.					KIRA			And you're going to take the 			credit for that?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Reckoning" - REV. 3/9/98 - ACT FIVE     55.76   CONTINUED:					WINN 			I take it as a sign that I did the 			right thing.	Kira can't believe what she's hearing --					KIRA 			You defied the will of the 			Prophets. And you did it because 			you couldn't stand the fact that 			a human, an infidel, had a 			stronger faith than you. The 			Emissary was willing to sacrifice 			his own son to serve the Prophets.	Kira's struck a chord, but Winn refuses to show it.					WINN 			My faith is as pure as the 			Emissary's.					KIRA 			I think you're confusing faith 			with ambition.	Winn has heard enough					WINN 			I'm not confusing anything, child, 			you are. The Prophets chose you 			as their instrument, that doesn't 			mean you can speak for them.	But Kira's on a roll -- if anything, her experience 	with the Prophets has given her clarity, and the 	courage to speak her mind.					KIRA			Because of your interference, 			the Reckoning was stopped. The 			Evil still exists. And I'm not 			sure even the Prophets know what 			that means for Bajor.	For once, Winn is speechless. Her features falter as 	she realizes Kira's right. After a silent beat, she 	pulls her robes tighter and, mustering as much dignity 	as she can, EXITS through the airlock. Off Kira's 	thoughtful features, we...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
