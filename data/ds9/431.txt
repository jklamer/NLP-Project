SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.2    INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL	A table somewhat away from the main action.  A tall, elegantly 	dressed and mannered man in his forties, MARTUS, is bending 	a sympathetic ear toward his companion, an alien matron, 	ALSIA, who appears to be a couple of decades his senior.					ALSIA			When my husband was alive we ran the 			business together.  And I managed to 			put away a bit of latinum every year, 			just for myself.  Now that he's 			gone... Well, I've got quite a little 			sum...	Martus nods, his voice the very essence of sympathy -- when 	Martus talks, it's as if he absolutely, unquestionably, no-	two-ways-about-it is on your side.					MARTUS			That's important...	She nods, smiling.  Then the smile slowly fades...					ALSIA			To be honest... It's not really 			enough.  Not for the future.  Not 			for the way I want to live out my 			retirement...				(beat)			So I've decided to invest it all --	She catches herself.  Then shakes her head, as if amazed.					ALSIA				(continuing)			I can't believe I'm telling you 			this... We just met.            DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/20/93 - TEASER            2.2    CONTINUED:					ALSIA (Cont'd)			But I think I can really trust you.  			I feel like we've known each other 			forever.					MARTUS				(shrugs)			When hearts are in sympathy... time 			collapses...	He puts a sympathetic hand on hers... she smiles in response.3    ON ODO	ENTERING Quark's from across the room.  He's scanning the 	place with intent -- a man on a mission.4    RESUME SCENE	The matron puts her free hand on top of Martus's.					ALSIA			I'm taking everything I've saved, 			and I'm purchasing the mining 			concession for the entire Vlugta 			asteroid belt.					MARTUS			Asteroid mining?  How adventurous.				(concerned)			But are you sure that's wise?  			Prospecting can be risky.	She leans toward him across the table.					ALSIA			Not this time.				(confidentially)			My father was a stellar cartographer.  			Thirty years ago, he conducted a 			full spectrum mineralogical analysis 			of those asteroids.  But he never 			had the means to follow up on what 			he found.					MARTUS				(with admiration)			And now you plan to carry out your 			father's dream.            DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - TEASER           2A.4    CONTINUED:					ALSIA				(nods)			When his survey results become public, 			I'll get seven times my investment 			back... overnight.				(laughs)			I still can't believe I'm telling 			you all this.  My "secret plan." 			I've been thinking about it for years.  			I never even told my husband... it 			must be all this Gamzian wine.					MARTUS			How brave of you... handling 			everything on your own...					ALSIA				(flattered)			It hasn't been easy.  There's so 			much to keep track of... so much to 			do.					MARTUS				(light bulb)			Maybe I can help.				(a beat)			Would you consider... Some kind 			of... partnership?	Alsia smiles.  She's vulnerable, lonely, in a little over 	her head.  Martus is just what she needs... Until...            DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - TEASER            3.5    INCLUDE ODO'S HAND	as it's planted firmly on Martus's shoulder.  Martus cringes 	under the grip, glancing up.6    THE SCENE	Odo is standing next to Martus, hand in place.  Alsia looks 	concerned.					ODO			Let's go.	Martus glances at the hand on his shoulder -- but Odo doesn't 	budge.					MARTUS			Exactly where are we going?					ODO			To Security.	The woman reacts.  Martus keeps his sophisticated cool.					MARTUS			But I've done nothing wrong.	His companion nods vigorously.					ALSIA			It's true.  We were just talking.					ODO			You were talking, Madam.  He was 			listening.	Martus scowls.  OFF the woman's puzzled look.7    INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	Odo escorts Martus.					MARTUS			Security Chief Odo, isn't it?					ODO			I've been watching you since you 			arrived.					MARTUS			Should I be flattered?            DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - TEASER            4.7    CONTINUED:					ODO			Martus Mazur... A refuge from the 			El-Aurian system...					MARTUS			Everyone has to be from somewhere.				(a beat)			Where are you from, Odo?	Odo looks up at Martus.  The con man's face is open, 	sympathetic.					ODO				(harsh)			Don't try to pull that routine on 			me.					MARTUS				(innocently)			What routine?					ODO			I know all about you El-Aurians.  			You're "listeners."  People like to 			talk to you.	Martus shrugs.            DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/20/93 - TEASER            5.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					MARTUS			Everyone needs someone to confide 			in... Someone to hear their stories... 			I offer a sympathetic ear.  And if 			they request my help -- I give it to 			them.					ODO			That couple from Pythro Five told me 			you asked for their financial access 			codes.					MARTUS			Some might call helping an elderly 			couple invest their savings a 			compassionate act.					ODO			Not when you invest it in your own 			business.  A business that promptly 			folds.					MARTUS			I had a run of bad luck.  No one 			regrets it more than I do.					ODO			You're a con man.  And they've signed 			a complaint.	Martus's confidence seems to break for a moment at this news.7AA   OMITTED7A   INT. HOLDING AREA (OPTICAL)	Odo pushes Martus backward into the open security cell.  	Martus looks around the cell, noting his cellmate, an ancient, 	diseased-looking alien (COS), then turns back to Odo.  His 	voice is thoughtful, sympathetic.					MARTUS				(re: cell)			This isn't necessary.  I'm not going 			anywhere.  Let's have a drink.  Talk 			a bit...	Odo harumphs and activates the cell field barrier.  He turns 	and heads away.  OFF Martus's scowl...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                     DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/20/93 - ACT ONE            6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:8    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.9    INT. CORRIDOR	O'BRIEN is walking jauntily along, carrying an athletic bag 	and dressed in very casual workout clothes -- the DS9 	equivalent of cut-off sweats, old t-shirt and tennis shoes.  	He's practice-swinging with anticipation a racquetball-type 	racquet -- as if really looking forward to working out.	O'Brien comes to a door and goes inside.10   INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - CONTINUOUS	O'Brien ENTERS and is surprised to find BASHIR inside.  And 	also geared up for play -- only Bashir is dressed in the 	latest professional-style fashion.  O'Brien looks like a 	pickup player by comparison.	The doctor is warming up, stretching his muscles with a set 	of highly stylized stretches that also tell of serious formal 	training in the sport.					BASHIR				(in greeting)			Chief.	O'Brien tries not very successfully to cover his 	disappointment at finding someone else in his court.					O'BRIEN			Oh.  Hello, Doctor...					BASHIR				(re: court)			Great job.  You built it yourself, 			didn't you?	Bashir doesn't mean it in a patronizing way, but somehow the 	question rubs O'Brien the wrong way.					O'BRIEN			Yeah.  Just finished.  I missed 			playing.  And I figured there'd be 			at least a couple of players on board.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - ACT ONE            7.10   CONTINUED:	O'Brien sets down his racquet and athletic bag and also 	starts to stretch -- his exercises, like his gear, suggest a 	non-organized approach to the game.					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			I didn't think you'd be one of them.					BASHIR			Captain of the team at Starfleet 			Medical School.  We took the sector 			championship my last year.	O'Brien reacts.					O'BRIEN			Against other medical students.	Bashir laughs.					BASHIR			Against everybody.				(remembers)			I played a Vulcan in the finals.  			Talk about stamina -- I don't think 			he ever actually broke a sweat.	O'Brien looks at him.					O'BRIEN				(surprised)			And you won?					BASHIR				(of course)			Took him on a back wall riser shot.	O'Brien considers this as Bashir goes into a slightly bizarre 	exercise -- opening his arms wide and thrusting elbows back 	in a cross between Tai Chi and a flapping chicken.					O'BRIEN			Well, I can't say I've had much in 			the way of...				(a look at the weird 				exercise)			... formal training.	O'Brien picks up his racquet and takes a ball out of his 	athletic bag.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/20/93 - ACT ONE            8.10   CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			But it's been a serious pastime for 			a lot of years.					BASHIR				(over-helpful)			Some of the toughest players I've 			run into didn't know what they were 			doing --	Whoops.					BASHIR				(continuing)			-- formally I mean.  Hey, whatever 			works, works.				(quickly)			This exercise for example.  I picked 			it up at a tournament from a top 			player.  It's a four thousand year 			old battle warmup.  According to 			legend, it "makes the heart a friend 			to the hand."	He pauses.					BASHIR				(continuing)			Medically, I don't know what that 			means.  All I know is it gives me 			more energy.	Bashir picks up his own racquet.					BASHIR			Feel like playing?	O'Brien tosses the ball to Bashir.					O'BRIEN			Serve.	Bashir bounces the ball a couple of times in warmup.					BASHIR				(re: floor lines)			I'd guess from the lines you prefer 			Old Style rules.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - ACT ONE            9.10   CONTINUED:	(3)	O'Brien bristles slightly at the insinuation -- even if 	Bashir didn't intend anything by it.					O'BRIEN			I can play any style you want.					BASHIR				(shrugs)			Traditional it is.  Always been my 			personal favorite anyway --					O'BRIEN				(with edge)			-- Serve.	Bashir SMASHES one against the wall.  The velocity catches 	O'Brien off-guard and he doesn't return.					BASHIR				(almost apologetic)			One...	OFF O'Brien as he girds for the battle.11   INT. HOLDING CELL	Martus looks in disbelief at...12   HIS CELLMATE	an old, misshapen alien lying asleep on the other bunk -- 	the Cos.  His wheeze sounds like a death rattle.  Martus 	cringes in disgust.					MARTUS			Pardon me, Friend.	No response.					MARTUS				(louder)			Pardon me.	The noise continues unabated.  Martus gets up, steps over.  	The view from up close isn't pretty -- the alien looks as 	bad as he sounds.					MARTUS				(continuing)			Ugh...           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - ACT ONE           10.12   CONTINUED:	Martus carefully reaches down without touching him, and 	shakes the cot.  The snoring stops.  In fact, there's a long 	beat where it doesn't seem like he's breathing at all.  	Martus's eyes go wide.					MARTUS				(continuing)			Friend?  Are you all right... ?	Martus leans hesitantly forward -- as if to place his ear 	close to the alien's chest and listen for a heartbeat.  A 	SUDDEN CHOKING BREATH almost makes Martus jump out of his 	shoes.  The alien cellmate coughs and sits up.					MARTUS				(continuing)			I thought you had died.					COS			If only...	Martus steps back as the alien hacks a couple of more times, 	then seems to recover.					COS				(continuing)			If only I could be so fortunate.					MARTUS			You were snoring.	Martus goes back to his cot.  The alien smiles sadly.					COS			Forgive me.  But as you can see, my 			health is not good.					MARTUS			Yes.  Well, sorry I had to wake you.	Martus turns away, hoping the conversation will end.					COS			I wasn't always like this.					MARTUS				(dismissive)			Of course not.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - ACT ONE           11.12   CONTINUED:	(2)					COS				(not getting the hint)			I had youth.

It has a strange design, covered by curious 	angles and curves, as if fashioned from exotic seashells.	Martus stares as Cos thumbs a button on the device.  It chirps 	and whistles strangely.					MARTUS			A gambling device.	The sound suddenly stops.  The device is quiet as before.					MARTUS				(continuing)			Did you win?					COS				(weary smile)			Of course not.	Martus doesn't understand the response, but he's still 	intrigued.					MARTUS			You gambled away everything you had?           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT ONE           13.12   CONTINUED:	(4)					COS			In a manner of speaking.				(beat)			Every trade deal I struck was a 			disaster.

He lies 	back down.					MARTUS			What does that have to do with a 			toy?  Sounds like you just had a lot 			of rotten luck.					COS			Yes.  "Rotten luck."  In the end...				(he looks at the device)			It all comes down to luck.	Cos works the device again.  The sounds begin again.  Only 	this time, when they stop, the entire device HUMS and GLOWS 	brightly for a beat, then fades.					COS				(in awe)			I... won...13   MARTUS	isn't really paying attention.					MARTUS			That's nice...				(beat)			What did you win... ?14   THE COS'S HANDS	go limp, dropping the ball onto the floor.15   FOLLOW THE DEVICE	as it rolls across the room, banging up against Martus's cot.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT ONE           14.16   INCLUDE MARTUS	as he reaches over and picks up the device.					MARTUS			You dropped it...	No response.

It couldn't have 			been that bad.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT TWO           17.20   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			No, really.  His face was flushed.  			I could've taken his pulse just by 			watching the side of his neck.					DAX			Then why didn't you stop?					BASHIR			Don't think I didn't try.  After the 			first game, I said I had an 			appointment.  He ignored me.  Then 			after the second, I said I was getting 			tired.  He didn't believe me.	They sit down.					BASHIR				(continuing)			Then he broke his racquet and I 			figured finally.  But no.  He made 			me stay there while he went and 			replicated another one.					DAX			So what finally happened?					BASHIR			While he was gone, I called my 			assistant.  Told her to call me back 			after five minutes and say there was 			an emergency in the Infirmary.	Dax can't help but smile.					DAX			That's terrible.					BASHIR			I had no other way out!  Otherwise 			there would have been an emergency -- 			Chief O'Brien's coronary!					DAX			At least it's all over.					BASHIR			That's just it.  This is only the 			beginning.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT TWO           18.20   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR			The Chief wants a rematch.  I'm 			telling you... it's going to kill 			him.	Dax takes a sip of her drink, sets it down.					DAX			Honestly, Julian.  You're 			exaggerating.  O'Brien's not a day 			over thirty-eight...					BASHIR			Too young to die...	Bashir shakes his head.					BASHIR				(continuing)			I guess I am overstating the health 			risk.  But that's not the point.  			The Chief has a lot of pride.  And 			for good reason.  I really respect 			him -- the things he's done, the 			kind of man he is.	A long beat.					BASHIR				(continuing)			I don't want to humiliate him...	OFF Bashir's genuine concern.21   INT. HOLDING CELL	Martus is sitting on his bunk... the alien cellmate has been 	removed.  Martus is idly playing with the gambling device 	left behind.

QUARK'S	QUARK and ROM are at the bar with MORN.  They are playing a 	penny ante game for the price of Morn's drink.					QUARK			All right.

Martus picks up the triangular coin, places it in 	the basket.					MARTUS			Double or nothing?					QUARK				(no way)			Double nothing is still nothing.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - ACT TWO          20A.24   CONTINUED:	Martus shows him the game.					MARTUS			If I lose, I'll give you this.	Quark's not sure what the alien game is, but...					QUARK				(why not?)			House always takes blue.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT TWO           21.24   CONTINUED:	(2)	Martus turns the basket, the coin spill out and comes up 	white.					QUARK				(begrudgingly)			Lucky.	Martus tries not to react to Quark's comment.					MARTUS			My luck's running good today.					QUARK			So I heard.				(off Martus's look)			Decided not to testify, did they?	Quark serves a drink in a very thin, flute-like glass.  Martus 	downs it.					MARTUS				(innocent)			I don't know what you mean.					QUARK			No?	Quark indicates Martus's elegant clothes.					QUARK				(continuing)			The forty-seventh Rule of Acquisition 			says "Don't trust a man wearing a 			better suit than your own."  Either 			you're a con artist or you're covering 			up an empty coin purse.				(toothy grin)			I happen to know it's both.	If this rattles Martus he doesn't let it show.  In fact, he 	glances around and smiles with admiration, thumbing the game 	absentmindedly and winning.					MARTUS			I suppose we can't all be as 			successful as you.	Quark finds himself glancing around with Martus, nodding.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT TWO           22.24   CONTINUED:	(3)					QUARK			Too true.	Quark notices Martus play the game (and win) again.					QUARK				(continuing, curious)			Some kind of game?				(Martus nods)			I've never seen that one before.  			How do you play?	Martus hands the device to Quark.  It looks captivating in 	the light.					MARTUS			Just push that key.	Quark follows Martus's directions.  The game chirps and 	whistles, then goes dead.  No winner.					MARTUS				(continuing)			Too bad.	Martus takes it, tries it himself.  The device chirps and 	whistles, then HUMS and GLOWS, beautifully.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - ACT TWO           23.24   CONTINUED:	(4)					MARTUS				(continuing; shrugs)			As I said.  My luck's running good 			today.	He sets the device on the bar between them.  Quark is 	interested, but covers the sentiment with a dismissive 	gesture.					QUARK			Am I supposed to be impressed?					MARTUS			A little tinkering, some replication 			and expansion.  It might make a nice 			addition to your casino.	Quark glances at it, seems to barely keep from yawning.					QUARK			Who would play this?  It's a child's 			toy.				(as if getting an 				idea)			My nephew.  It might keep him out of 			my ears for a couple of days.	Quark reaches down and pulls out a few latinum pieces, 	casually dropping them on the table.					QUARK				(continuing)			I'll take it.	Martus glances down at the coins.  He considers Quark's offer.					MARTUS				(tempted)			That's a tidy sum.					QUARK			I'm feeling benevolent today.				(a beat)			Have another.	Quark casually sets another of the same drink in front of 	him.  Suddenly Martus smiles.					MARTUS			I might have accepted.  But the offer 			of the drink... That tells me you're 			very interested.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT TWO          23A.24   CONTINUED:	(5)	Martus has scored a point, but Quark instantly recovers.					QUARK			Nonsense.

You might 			be able to trade it for a meal.  But 			it won't be a hot one.					MARTUS			You'd be in profit by the end of the 			week.	Quark offhandedly doubles the amount of coins on the bar.					QUARK			Final offer.  Take it before my 			magnanimity fades.	Martus is desperate for cash, and again, is sorely tempted.  	He again plays the game -- again it wins, glowing in response.  	Quark can't keep the desire out of his eyes.  Martus smiles.					MARTUS			Perhaps I'll hang onto it a bit 			longer...	Martus downs the glass.  Quark shrugs.					QUARK			Suit yourself.  But be under no 			illusions.  If I had been serious 			about acquiring this -- it would be 			mine.  And for substantially less 			than what you'd hoped for.					MARTUS			It seems overconfidence comes in 			small packages around here.					QUARK			My track record speaks for itself.				(beat)			Just like your security file.	A beat as they stare each other down.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/18/93 - ACT TWO           25.24   CONTINUED:	(7)					MARTUS			Thanks for the drink.	Martus heads out the door with the device.

PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS	Martus has left Quark's and is wandering along the Promenade.  	O'Brien is jogging toward him -- weighted down with ankle 	and wrist weights.  He passes in a huff.	Martus continues, eyeing a mature Bajoran widow, ROANA, who 	is supervising the closing of her shop.  The shelves are 	empty and two Bajoran workers are moving out the last of the 	merchandise.  Martus approaches her.					MARTUS				(probing)			Times are difficult...	She shrugs.					ROANA			Oh, it's not that.  Business is 			good...					MARTUS			Then why are you shutting down?					ROANA			My husband and I ran this place for 			nine years.  Before that we had a 			shop on Bajor for seventeen.  But he 			passed away a few months ago.  And 			my heart just isn't in it anymore.					MARTUS			Not the same, is it?  Working by 			yourself...					ROANA				(perks up)			No.  It's so much nicer to work next 			to someone else.				(smiles)			You understand.	Martus smiles and gives a little nod -- yes, he always 	understands...           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT TWO           26.26   INT. RACQUETBALL COURT	Mid-game.  O'Brien smacks the ball -- Bashir tries to return, 	misses.  Even though it didn't look that tough.					BASHIR			Nice shot!	O'Brien looks like he can barely contain his anger.  He takes 	the ball, serves.  Again, Bashir misses.					BASHIR				(continuing)			Damn.	The ball bounces around for a bit.  O'Brien doesn't touch it -- 	he's too ticked off.  Bashir picks it up, tosses it to O'Brien 	who smacks it out the way with his open hand, sending it 	flying across the court.					O'BRIEN			You think I'm stupid, too?					BASHIR			What are you talking about?	O'Brien points a finger in his face.					O'BRIEN			I don't need your charity.  Next 			time, you play your best game or you 			don't play.	O'Brien whips around and is out the door.  OFF Bashir's face 	as he lets out a frustrated breath.27   INT.

But you're playing a 			great game.					O'BRIEN			The best I've played in my entire 			life.				(beat)			I'm making shots I couldn't make 			fifteen years ago.  When I was playing 			five hours a day, every day.  I can't 			miss.					BASHIR			And I can't hit the broad side of a 			Plygorian Mammoth.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT FIVE          62.77   CONTINUED:	O'Brien tosses the ball to Bashir.					O'BRIEN			Try throwing it against the wall.	Bashir complies... and the ball takes a weird bounce and 	careens away from him.					BASHIR			It should have come straight back to 			me.				(O'Brien picks up the 				ball)			You try.	O'Brien throws the ball hard into the wall and it comes 	back... right into his hand.	O'Brien throws the ball again, but this time at an angle.  	The ball bounces wildly from one wall to another... then 	flies right into his open hand.  O'Brien and Bashir exchange 	a look.					O'BRIEN				(hits companel)			O'Brien to Ops.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/20/93 - ACT FIVE          63.78thru   OMITTED8181A  EXT.

RACQUETBALL COURT	CLOSE on O'Brien's hand as the ball flies into it again.  	WIDEN TO REVEAL that Sisko and Dax have joined O'Brien and 	Bashir.					BASHIR			It goes right to his hand.  Every 			single time.					O'BRIEN			I must've done it a dozen times by 			now.  And I haven't missed once yet.					BASHIR			Nobody can be that lucky.  It's 			impossible.					DAX			Not impossible.  Just extremely 			improbable.	Everyone looks to Dax.					O'BRIEN			Improbable?					SISKO				(gets it)			Like the neutrinos on the station 			spinning the same way.  Or a few 			dozen people having minor accidents 			at the same instant.  Or a system 			failing at just the wrong time.					DAX			Exactly.  Someone or something on 			this station is distorting the laws 			of probability.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT FIVE         63A.82   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Changing them so that incredibly 			unlikely things can happen on a 			regular basis.					O'BRIEN			How can we find out what's causing 			it?					DAX				(smiles)			I think I know a way.83   INT. CLUB MARTUS	Martus is still alone at the machines.  He plays 	automatically, trying not to think about his increasingly 	desperate situation.  He's losing.84   INCLUDE SISKO AND DAX	As they ENTER the club.  Dax has her tricorder out.  Martus 	glances up at them.					DAX				(consulting tricorder)			Ninety-eight percent of the neutrinos 			in this room are rotating clockwise.	Dax follows her readings straight toward the machines.  Martus 	smiles and steps away from the machines, making a sweeping 	gesture of welcome.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT FIVE          64.84   CONTINUED:					MARTUS			The games are open...	But Dax starts looking behind the machines.					SISKO			We're not here to play.				(turns away)			Dax?					DAX			One hundred percent clockwise.				(puts away her 				tricorder)			It's these machines.	Martus is taken aback.					MARTUS			My gambling machines?  What's wrong 			with them.					DAX			Somehow these machines are altering 			the laws of probability all over the 			station.	A beat.  Martus makes the connection.					MARTUS				(remembering)			So that's what he meant.					SISKO			Who?					MARTUS			The alien who gave me the original... 			He said that it all came down to 			luck.  That must be how it works.  			When you win, it makes you lucky, 			and when you lose...					DAX			But these machines are effecting 			everyone on the station, whether 			they play them or not.					MARTUS				(trying to dodge 				responsibility)			Impossible.  You must be mistaken.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT FIVE          65.84   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			Wait a minute.  You said there was 			an original machine?					MARTUS			Yes, a smaller one.  When I opened 			the club I replicated these larger 			versions...	Martus trails off.					SISKO				(accusingly)			Larger versions.	Sisko's tone of voice says that he thinks Martus is a moron.  	From the look on Martus's face, he might agree.					SISKO			How do you turn them off?					MARTUS			I'm not completely sure.					SISKO			Then how did you turn them on in the 			first place?					MARTUS				(realizing he's blown 				it bad)			I didn't, exactly.  I just... told 			the replicator to scan the original 			and make copies.				(trying to be helpful)			I think they have some kind of 			internal power source.	Sisko's heard enough.  He takes out a phaser.					SISKO			Lieutenant.	Dax follows suit.					MARTUS				(panicky)			Wait... what are you doing?           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/19/93 - ACT FIVE          66.84A  NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Sisko nods and he and Dax fire at the machines, destroying 	them completely.					SISKO				(turns to Martus)			Now... as for you...					MARTUS			You can't possibly blame me for this, 			Commander.					SISKO			I'd like to.  Unfortunately, I don't 			have anything I can charge you with.					ODO (O.S.)			Fortunately, I do.85   INCLUDE ODO	As he ENTERS the club.					ODO			That elderly Pythron couple you 			"assisted" has had a change of heart.  			They've decided to press charges 			after all.	Martus is crestfallen.86   INT. HOLDING CELL (OPTICAL)	Martus is alone is a holding cell.  He looks up and sees Odo 	and Alsia entering the holding area.					MARTUS			Alsia.  I knew you'd come to get me 			out.	Odo harumphs and escorts Alsia to the other cell.           DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/20/93 - ACT FIVE          67.86   CONTINUED:					ODO			Inside.	She enters and Odo activates the security field.					MARTUS			What's the meaning of this.					ODO			Ask him.	Odo looks to the door as Quark ENTERS.					QUARK			Your lady friend over there just 			tried to scam me.					MARTUS			Scam?					QUARK				(disdainful)			Asteroid mining.  To think anyone 			would be foolish enough to be taken 			in by that old trick.				(smiles)			But don't worry, Martus, I've come 			to get you out.	Martus stands, steps toward Quark.  Considers him.					MARTUS			In return for what?					QUARK			Nothing.  Pure generosity.	Quark smiles.					MARTUS			You're enjoying this, aren't you?					QUARK			Taken in by one of your own victims.  			And no one to turn to but me.  I 			can't remember when I've been so... 			entertained.	A beat as they consider each other -- still competitors to 	the core.       DEEP SPACE: "Rivals" - REV. 10/25/93 - ACT FIVE 68-69.          86   CONTINUED:	(2)					MARTUS			I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.  			Now how about giving me two thousand 			Isiks so I can book passage off the 			station.	Quark interrupts.					QUARK			-- You want me to give you money?  			Ridiculous.  Of all the ungrateful 			arrogance.					MARTUS			Unless you want me to stay here on 			the station.					QUARK			All right.  I'll loan you five hundred 			Isiks.  You can book passage on a 			cargo ship.					MARTUS			Fifteen hundred.  After all, I do 			have expenses.					QUARK			Six hundred.					MARTUS				(offended)			Twelve hundred.  I still have my 			dignity.					QUARK			"Dignity and an empty sack is worth 			the sack."  Rule of Acquisition number 			one hundred nine.	And as they argue, Odo decides he's heard enough, harumphs 	and EXITS.					MARTUS			All right.  Eight hundred.					QUARK			Go on... I'm listening.	And as Quark smiles, knowing he's got Martus on the ropes...86Athru   OMITTED87									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
