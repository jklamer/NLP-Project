PROMENADE	BASHIR and GARAK walk together down the Promenade.  Even 	though he's an everyday sight, some of the Bajorans on the 	Promenade react to Garak with a muted hostility.  Garak and 	Bashir are in mid-conversation.					GARAK			What a waste of a morning.  That 			Galipotan freighter was scheduled to 			be here at oh-seven hundred and it 			still hasn't arrived yet.				(beat)			Well, I suppose that's the price of 			doing business with a culture that 			refuses to even acknowledge the 			concept of time... And I have to 			admit, they make magnificent sweaters.	Bashir tries unsuccessfully to cover a yawn.					GARAK			I hope I'm not boring you, Doctor.					BASHIR			Not at all, I was just up late last 			night.					GARAK			Entertaining one of your lady friends?					BASHIR				(smiles)			Unfortunately, no.  Actually, I was 			reading the last few chapters 			of The Never-Ending Sacrifice.					GARAK			Isn't it superb... without a doubt 			the finest Cardassian novel ever 			written.					BASHIR				(not sold)			I'll take your word for it.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - TEASER              2.1    CONTINUED:	Garak smiles at Bashir's lack of enthusiasm.					GARAK			You didn't enjoy it?					BASHIR			I thought it was... interesting.  			Though maybe a little dull.				(backpedaling)			In spots.	Bashir and Garak reach...2    INT. REPLIMAT	And join a long line of people waiting for the replicators.					GARAK				(reacting to the crowd)			Wonderful.  At this rate, we should 			be done eating lunch just in time 			for dinner.					BASHIR			There's always Quark's.					GARAK			True, but I'm really not in the mood 			for noisy, crowded and vulgar today.					BASHIR			Then I suppose the Klingon restaurant 			is out of the question?	Garak rubs his temples and doesn't deign to respond.					GARAK			I can't believe I'm eating lunch 			with a man who thinks The Never-			Ending Sacrifice is dull.					BASHIR			I just thought it got a little 			redundant after a while.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - TEASER              3.2    CONTINUED:					BASHIR (Cont'd)			I mean... the author is supposed to 			be chronicling seven generations of 			a single family... but he tells the 			same story over and over again... 			All the characters live lives of 			selfless duty to the state... get 			old... and die.  And then the next 			generation comes along and does it 			all over again.	Garak rubs his temples.  He doesn't seem to be in his usual 	good spirits.					GARAK			That's the whole point, Doctor.  The 			repetitive epic is the most elegant 			form of Cardassian literature, and 			The Never-Ending Sacrifice is it's 			greatest achievement.					BASHIR			But the characters never really come 			alive.  I mean, there's more to life 			than serving the state.					GARAK			A Federation viewpoint if ever I 			heard one.	Garak looks impatiently at the line.					GARAK				(continuing, cranky)			This is ridiculous.  Can't you just 			move to the front of the line?  Tell 			them it's a medical emergency or 			something.					BASHIR			We're almost there.				(picking up where 				Garak left off)			Look, maybe if you lent me another 			book... by a different writer...	Garak wrinkles his brow and squeezes his temples as if 	fighting off a bad headache.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - TEASER              4.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK			It would only be a waste of time.  			When it comes to art, you're obviously 			a prisoner of Federation dogma and 			human prejudice.					BASHIR			Sorry you feel that way... but I am 			trying my best to...	Bashir trails off as Garak suddenly grabs his brow in intense 	pain.					BASHIR			Are you all right?	Garak struggles to suppress his reaction to the pain.					GARAK			I'm fine.	But Bashir is already examining Garak.					BASHIR			You don't look fine.  Your skin is 			clammy and your pupils are contracted.	Suddenly Garak's face relaxes as if his pain has completely 	disappeared.  He almost smiles and seems to feel much better.					GARAK				(feeling great)			I assure you, I'm in perfect health.				(changing the subject)			Now, you were asking about other 			Cardassian novels... Something maybe 			a little more accessible...	But to Garak's surprise, he's hit by another stab of pain 	and can't help but wince.					BASHIR			"Perfect health" you say?  Then 			Cardassian standards must be a little 			lower than mine.  Come on.	Bashir takes Garak gently by the arm and tries to lead him 	out of line.  Garak doesn't budge.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - TEASER              5.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					GARAK				(false pleasantness)			Doctor, what do you think you're 			doing?					BASHIR			Taking you to the Infirmary.					GARAK			That won't be necessary.	But Garak winces again, despite his best efforts not to.					BASHIR			Maybe not, but humor me.					GARAK			Frankly Doctor, I'm getting a little 			tired of humoring you.  There's 			nothing wrong with me that a little 			peace and privacy wouldn't cure.  			Now if you'll excuse me.				(shrugs Bashir off)			I seem to have lost my appetite.	And as Garak walks away...	INCLUDE KIRA	Who has witnessed Garak's strange behavior.					KIRA			What was that all about?3    CLOSE ON BASHIR	Who watches the usually amiable tailor with a mixture of 	curiosity and concern.					BASHIR			I have no idea.	And as Bashir tries to figure out what's bothering Garak, 	we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                       DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE             6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)4    INT. DAX'S QUARTERS	Bashir is running his medical tricorder over a bizarre alien 	plant.  The plant is drooping and pathetic looking.  DAX 	looks on with concern.					DAX			Can you tell what's wrong with it?					BASHIR			In my expert medical opinion, I'd 			say...				(hasn't got a clue)			It's sick.					DAX			I know that... but why is it sick?					BASHIR			I'm a doctor, not a botanist.  Why 			don't you ask Professor O'Brien?					DAX			Keiko's at a hydroponics conference 			on Rigel Four.  She won't be back 			for a week.					BASHIR			And none of your past hosts had any 			experience with plants?					DAX			Daxes have never been much on 			gardening.  Tobin was the only one 			who ever tried his hand at it, but 			he had even less luck with plants 			than he did with women...					BASHIR			Do you even know where it's from?					DAX			I picked it up on Ledonia Three.	Bashir scans the plant again.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE             7.4    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Hmmm.				(indicates her desk 				computer)			May I?					DAX			Be my guest.	Bashir consults her monitor, then checks the plant one more 	time.					BASHIR				(to himself)			That explains it.				(to Dax)			Ledonian soil contains a benevolent 			mycorrhizal fungus that helps the 			native plants retain water.  But the 			fungus in this potting soil's almost 			completely died out.  If we can 			salvage what's left and cultivate a 			new batch in the lab, that should do 			the trick.					DAX				(with affection)			Keiko would be proud of you.	During the following, Bashir uses his medical kit to take 	the soil sample.					BASHIR				(no big deal)			It's all right here on the screen.  			I only wish my humanoid patients 			were as easy to treat.					DAX			Chief O'Brien dislocate his shoulder 			again?					BASHIR				(shakes his head)			It's Garak.  At lunch today, he seemed 			like he was about to have some kind 			of seizure.  He was having trouble 			breathing and he appeared to be in a 			great deal of pain.  But when I tried 			to get him to go to the Infirmary, 			he outright refused.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE             8.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX			Maybe he just doesn't like going to 			the doctor.					BASHIR			It's not that... it's that damn 			Cardassian evasiveness of his.				(frustrated)			I mean making me guess about his 			past is one thing, but when it comes 			to his health... why can't he just 			tell me what's going on?					DAX			It sounds like you're taking this 			personally.	Bashir finishes taking the sample and he and Dax EXIT into...4A   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS)					BASHIR			I suppose I am.  After all, Garak and 			I've been having lunch together once 			a week for more than a year now.  			You'd think he'd trust me a little.					DAX			Why should he?  It's not like you 			two are really friends.					BASHIR			No... of course not.  I suppose when 			it comes right down to it, I don't 			trust him either.  I mean, for all I 			know, the man is a Cardassian spy.					DAX			Exactly.	They reach a turbolift door.					BASHIR				(peeved)			Fine.  If he doesn't want my help, 			that's his prerogative.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE             9.5    INT. PROMENADE	Bashir ENTERS the Promenade from one of the turbolifts.  	It's after hours and the Promenade is almost deserted, but 	Bashir is surprised to hear voices coming from Quark's.6    INT. QUARK'S	After hours.  Garak and QUARK are in mid-conversation.  Quark 	is cool, but Garak is intense and a little on edge.					GARAK			So then I take it we understand each 			other?					QUARK			Garak, how long have you been living 			on this station?					GARAK			Too long.					QUARK			And in all that time, have I ever 			let you down?					GARAK			I've never done business with you... 			until now.					QUARK			Which is why this deal is so important 			to me.  I want our business 			relationship to get off on the right 			foot.  Now relax, you'll get your 			merchandise.					GARAK				(anxious)			Soon, Quark... I can't wait much 			longer.	Garak EXITS Quark's and heads down the Promenade.7    ANGLE ON QUARK	Who watches Garak go, then shakes his head and begins tidying 	up.					BASHIR (O.S.)			You and Garak going into business?             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE            10.7    CONTINUED:	Quark is startled.  He turns and sees Bashir.					BASHIR				(off Quark's reaction)			I couldn't help but overhear your 			conversation.					QUARK				(dismissive)			Oh, that.  I'm helping Garak get a 			new sizing scanner for his shop.					BASHIR			A sizing scanner?					QUARK			Not just any sizing scanner.  The 			best.  Straight from Merak Two.  			Calibrated to be accurate down to 			the micrometer.  And, I might add, 			at a very reasonable price.					BASHIR			Really?  I thought Garak sounded a 			bit... upset.					QUARK			Upset?  Garak?  I hadn't noticed.				(predatory)			Now, is there anything I can do for 			you?  A little Saurian brandy to go?  			Or maybe a late night session in a 			holosuite?	Bashir studies Quark, not at all satisfied with his answers, 	but not sure it's worth the trouble to continue the 	conversation.  After a beat, he decides to give up... for 	now.					BASHIR			No.  Thank you.  I think I'll call 			it a night.					QUARK				(cool)			Suit yourself.	Bashir EXITS and Quark breathes a quiet sigh of relief.8    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	The station rotates slowly in space.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE            11.9    INT. INFIRMARY	NURSE JABARA is at work in the background.  Bashir is running 	a tech-device over SISKO's throat.					BASHIR			There.  How's that feel?					SISKO			Much better.					BASHIR			Try not to yell at any more admirals 			for a while.					SISKO			I wasn't yelling.  I was expressing 			my feelings...				(smiles at himself)			Loudly.	Sisko heads for the door just as O'BRIEN ENTERS.					SISKO				(in greeting)			Chief.	Sisko EXITS.					O'BRIEN			You wanted to see me?					BASHIR			Yes.  I was hoping you could give me 			a hand.	Bashir keys a command into his console and brings up a 	display.					BASHIR			I've been trying to access the old 			Cardassian medical files... but so 			far, I haven't had much luck.	This piques O'Brien's professional interest.  O'Brien works 	the console.					O'BRIEN				(while running a 				diagnostic)			I'm not surprised.  The Cardassians 			did a general systems purge before 			they pulled out.  The Medical Files 			would've been deleted along with 			everything else.					BASHIR			Is there any way you can recover 			them?					O'BRIEN				(off the monitor)			Maybe.  These subroutines don't look 			anywhere near as bad as the 			engineering systems did.  I might be 			able to reconstruct the data by 			microscanning the purge trace.					BASHIR			How long would that take?             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE            12.9    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Two, maybe three weeks.					BASHIR				(too long)			Well... that settles that.				(to O'Brien)			Thanks anyway, Chief.					O'BRIEN			Sorry I couldn't be more help.	Before Bashir can completely explain, the comm system CHIMES.					QUARK'S COM VOICE				(urgent)			Quark to Bashir...					BASHIR				(to com)			This is Bashir.					QUARK'S COM VOICE			Doctor... I need you in my bar right 			away.	Bashir and O'Brien exchange a brief look, then Bashir grabs 	an emergency med kit and EXITS.10   INT. QUARK'S	Bashir ENTERS to find Quark and his customers watching as 	Garak sits at a table, holding a half-full bottle of Kanar 	which he swigs liberally.  Two empty bottles lay forgotten 	on the table.	Garak is extremely drunk, but he's definitely still in a 	great deal of pain.					QUARK			Come on, Garak... Don't you think 			you've had enough?             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE            13.10   CONTINUED:					GARAK			On the contrary.  Anyone who talks 			about the numbing effects of liquor 			is severely overstating the case.	Garak takes another swig.					BASHIR				(to Quark)			What's all this?					QUARK			He came in complaining about a 			headache.  The next thing I knew he 			drank up half my stock of Kanar.	Garak cringes in pain.  He looks up and finally notices 	Bashir.					GARAK			Doctor... What a pleasant surprise... 			I'm sorry about my little outburst 			at lunch, but I'll make it up to 			you.  Please, join me.	The pain in Garak's head is constant and intense, but he's 	fighting it every step of the way.					BASHIR			I think I will.	Bashir gets a glass from off the bar and holds out his hand 	to Garak for the bottle.					BASHIR			May I?					GARAK			By all means.	He gives Bashir the bottle.             DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT ONE            14.10   CONTINUED:	(2)	Bashir takes the bottle and turns away.					GARAK			What are you doing?					BASHIR			It's too noisy in here.  I prefer to 			drink somewhere quiet.					GARAK			An excellent idea.				(staggers up)			We'll go to my quarters.					BASHIR			Whatever you want.  But first I have 			to stop at the Infirmary.	Garak stops in the middle of the room.					GARAK			The Infirmary.  My dear Doctor... 			what kind of fool do you take me 			for.  Give me back my bottle.					BASHIR			I will.

Is that 			all you have to say for yourself?  			You're just going to sit there and 			pretend that the last ten days never 			happened?					GARAK			I for one, Doctor, am perfectly 			satisfied with the way things turned 			out.  And I see no need to dwell on 			what was doubtlessly a difficult 			time for both of us.				(a beat)			By the way, I just had the most 			interesting conversation with 			Constable Odo.  It seems he was under 			the impression that I was a member 			of the Obsidian Order.					BASHIR			And what did you tell him?            DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT FIVE            57.75   CONTINUED:					GARAK			That he was mistaken, of course.					BASHIR			And he believed you?					GARAK			He said something about keeping a 			closer eye on me in the future.  I 			told him to be my guest... I have 			nothing to hide.	Garak takes out a dataclip and places it on the table.					GARAK				(continuing)			Here... I brought you something.					BASHIR			What is it?					GARAK			It's Meditations on a Crimson Shadow 			by Preloc.					BASHIR			More Cardassian literature.					GARAK			I think you'll find this one more to 			your taste.  It takes place in the 			future.  During a time when Cardassia 			and the Klingon Empire are at war.					BASHIR			Who wins?            DEEP SPACE: "The Wire" - 03/01/94 - ACT FIVE            58.75   CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK			Who do you think?					BASHIR				(smiling)			Never mind.  Don't tell me.  I 			wouldn't want you to spoil the ending.				(puts the clip down)			You know, I still have a lot of 			questions I want to ask you about 			your past.					GARAK			I've given you all the answers I'm 			capable of.					BASHIR			You gave me answers, all right.  But 			they were all different.  What I 			want to know is... of all the stories 			you told me, which ones were true 			and which ones weren't?	Garak gives Bashir his patented infuriating half-smile.					GARAK			My dear Doctor, they're all true...					BASHIR			Even the lies?					GARAK			Especially the lies.76   CLOSE ON BASHIR	Who can't help but shake his head and smile.  And as Garak 	and Bashir return to business as usual, we...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
