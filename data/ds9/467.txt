REPLIMAT	BASHIR and O'BRIEN are having lunch.  O'Brien is eating with 	a hearty appetite, while Bashir picks at his food.  Bashir 	is trying to get a conversation going, but not having much 	success -- O'Brien's responses are limited to nods and shrugs.					BASHIR			... if you ask me, modern human 			theater has been on the decline since 			the late twenty-third century.	O'Brien makes a motion that might be a shrug.					BASHIR				(continuing)			I mean, look at the plays coming out 			of Earth for the last fifty years 			and then compare them to the works 			of Willemheld, Barton or Chow-yun.	O'Brien gives him a distracted nod as he concentrates on the 	food.  Bashir makes one last attempt.					BASHIR				(continuing)			Modern playwrights have become 			obsessed with writing human 			interpretations of alien theatrical 			works and they're ignoring our own 			unique cultural heritage in hopes of -- 			Chief, are you listening to me?	O'Brien looks up in surprise with a mouthful of food.					O'BRIEN			What?       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - TEASER        2.1    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			I thought so.					O'BRIEN			I heard every word you said.				(off Bashir's look)			I have.				(thinking)			Chow-yun, Barton, alien theatrical 			works, ignoring our cultural 			heritage...					BASHIR			And what do you think?					O'BRIEN			About what?					BASHIR			Any of it.					O'BRIEN			I... don't know.  What do you want 			me to say?					BASHIR			Say you agree.  Say you disagree.  			Say you hate theater.  Just say 			something.					O'BRIEN			Look, Julian, you said you wanted to 			have lunch... so we're having lunch.					BASHIR			Yes.  But I was hoping for a little 			more... conversation with my plomeek 			soup.					O'BRIEN			My mother taught me that if you 			combine eating and talking, you'll 			end up doing neither one very well.       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - TEASER       2A.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR				(smiles)			Well, I suppose Garak taught me to 			think of lunch as a sort of... arena 			for philosophical debate.	Bashir's face looks a little melancholy... concerned about 	his friend.					BASHIR			I take it there's still no word about 			Garak and Odo?					O'BRIEN				(shakes his head)			The starship Portland and a Cardassian 			cruiser are still searching the Algira 			Sector for the runabout.				(beat)			That's not entirely bad news.

OPS (VPB)	SISKO and DAX are showing something to O'Brien on a monitor 	as KIRA looks on.					SISKO				(re: monitor)			About ten minutes ago, our sensors 			picked up high concentrations of 			tetryon particles moving toward the 			station.					DAX			I've never seen readings like this 			before.  What do you think?					O'BRIEN				(off monitor)			Subspace energy fluctuations... 			quantum fractures in the 			electrodynamic field... EM spikes 			across the spectrum... you've got 			me.					KIRA			Whatever it is, it's getting closer.          DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - TEASER          4.2    CONTINUED:					DAX			And larger.

ROMULAN READY ROOM	TAIN is seated at the table with a drink as GARAK pours 	himself a glass of Romulan ale.  The mood here seems to be 	friendly; after all, these are two old comrades-in-arms who 	haven't seen each other in a long time.  But underlying all 	that is a definite tension... a feeling that there are issues 	and frictions between the two of them that have yet to be 	resolved and which may never be fully addressed.					TAIN			... you should've seen the look on 			Legate Porania's face when I told 			him I was going into retirement three 			years ago.  He was literally 			speechless -- a rare event.					GARAK				(smiles)			I remember wanting to invent charges 			of treason against him just so I 			didn't have to hear his voice again.					TAIN			You would've done it, too, if I hadn't 			held you back.  You had quite a 			vicious streak in those days.					GARAK				(re: Tain)			I learned from the best.					TAIN			No, no.  You had a gift.  I never 			met anyone else who relished a good 			interrogation as much as you did.  			Do you remember getting that 			confession out of Doctor Parmak?					GARAK				(smiles)			I never even touched him.					TAIN			That was the beauty of it.  You just 			sat there for -- what, three hours?         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE         6A.6    CONTINUED:					GARAK			Four.					TAIN			And after four hours of watching you 			stare at him... he confessed.					GARAK			I was good, wasn't I?					TAIN			You were brilliant.  Afterwards, he 			just kept saying...				(shocked whisper)			"His eyes... his eyes... "	They both chuckle over the memory and then there's a quiet 	beat.					TAIN			I missed you, Elim.  Things just 			weren't the same after you left.	Garak looks away... uncomfortable with the honest statement 	of affection, but touched by it nonetheless.					GARAK			I... missed you too, Enabran.	Tain breaks the moment by chuckling a little.					TAIN			We're both getting sentimental in 			our old age... next thing you know, 			we'll be crying over our lost youth.	Garak also smiles with a little embarrassment.  He shifts 	the conversation back to a safer topic.					GARAK			So whatever happened to Doctor Parmak?					TAIN			He spent three years in a labor camp, 			then returned to Cardassia Prime.  I 			think he's practicing medicine again.				(beat, joking)			When we get back, you should look 			him up.       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - ACT ONE      6B.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK			There are a lot of people I intend 			to look up when we get back.					GARAK				(beat)			For instance, do you remember a Gul 			named Dukat?					TAIN				(thinks)			Dukat... ?					GARAK			He's the son of the late Justice 			Procal.					TAIN			Oh, yes... the business with the 			arms merchant.				(beat)			I take it, you'd like to have him 			eliminated...					GARAK			The thought had crossed my mind.					TAIN			After this mission is completed, 			you'll be in a position to... 			eliminate anyone you want.					GARAK			I'll make a list and give it to Mila.					TAIN				(casual)			You better give it to me personally.  			Mila may not be around much longer.  			She knows a great deal about me... 			too much for her own good.	Garak reacts slightly... this is a disturbing comment.  But 	Garak has to be careful here -- he doesn't want to admit 	that he actually cares about Mila lest Tain start to think 	of him as being "soft." Garak sips his ale with practiced 	nonchalance.					GARAK			Still... it would be a shame to have 			her killed.  She's proven that she 			can be trusted on numerous occasions.  			And you'd be hard pressed to find a 			better housekeeper.					TAIN			Is that a request I hear?         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE          7.6    CONTINUED:	(3)					GARAK			Not at all.  Just an observation.					TAIN			There's no reason to pretend, Garak.  			You're fond of Mila and you don't 			want her hurt, right?					GARAK			If you're looking for an excuse to 			spare the life of your own 			housekeeper, you don't need me to 			provide you with one.  You can do it 			out of... the kindness of your heart.	They look at each other for a long beat, each of them studying 	the other and running their own internal evaluations of the 	other's motive and intent.					TAIN				(quiet)			Mila always believed you were innocent 			of betraying Cardassia... and me.	Something flickers across Garak's face at this comment... 	some of the light bantering drops away from his tone.					GARAK			Really?  I'm surprised that alone 			didn't earn her a place on your 			execution rolls.         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE          8.6    CONTINUED:	(4)					TAIN			It occurred to me.  But then I suppose 			part of me wanted to believe you 			were innocent too.	Garak gives him a very direct look.					GARAK				(tight)			I was.					TAIN				(not quite believing 				it)			Of course.	Tain moves to take a drink from his glass.  He sniffs the 	glass and puts it aside in distaste.					TAIN			No wonder the Romulans haven't 			conquered the galaxy.  No one can 			stomach their cuisine.	Garak nods ruefully.  At that moment, a Romulan Colonel in 	the Tal Shiar named LOVOK ENTERS the room.  Lovok is a male 	Romulan in his late forties and has a clipped, no-nonsense 	attitude about him.					TAIN			Ah.  Colonel Lovok.  Allow me to 			introduce my associate, Elim Garak.	Lovok glances over at Garak with little interest.					LOVOK				(to Tain, re: Garak)			And what is his role to be in this 			operation?					TAIN			He will do whatever I require of 			him.  Elim is a cherished colleague 			of long standing.	Lovok gives Garak a direct look with the flat and lifeless 	eyes of a shark.         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE         8A.6    CONTINUED:	(5)					LOVOK			You will not enter the bridge or any 			other secured space aboard this ship 			unescorted.  If you do so, you will 			be killed.					GARAK			Direct isn't he?					TAIN			I'm afraid the Colonel believes in 			wasting little time with pleasantries 			or idle conversation.         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE          9.6    CONTINUED:	(6)	Lovok ignores Garak and speaks to Tain.					LOVOK			The fleet has recloaked and is about 			to set course for the Founders' 			homeworld at warp six.					GARAK			Warp six?  That's a bit slow isn't 			it?  Something wrong with your 			engines?	Lovok ignores him, keeps talking to Tain.					LOVOK			If we travel any faster, our warp 			signatures may be detected by the 			Jem'Hadar... even through the cloaking 			devices.					GARAK			Very clever.					LOVOK				(to Tain)			The changeling is in quarters on "C" 			deck.  There are forcefields in place 			to prevent his escape.					TAIN			Good.				(to Garak)			Which brings us to your first 			assignment, Garak.         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE         10.6    CONTINUED:	(7)					TAIN			I'd like you to explain to Odo that 			it would be in everyone's best 			interests -- especially his -- if he 			were to provide us with all the 			information he has on his people.					GARAK			That may prove to be difficult.  He 			can be quite stubborn.					TAIN				(casual)			Then you'll have to find a way of 			convincing him.	Tain says this without any hint of threat, but it hangs there 	in the air, nonetheless.  Garak nods in understanding.									CUT TO:7    INT. ROMULAN QUARTERS	ODO is looking around the sparsely furnished room with a 	professional eye, looking for any means of escape, but not 	really expecting to find any.  The door suddenly OPENS, 	revealing Garak and a Romulan N.D. Guard standing in the 	Corridor.  Garak's attitude is friendly as he ENTERS, but 	Odo regards him coolly.					GARAK			Well, Odo... I trust the 			accommodations meet with your 			approval?	Odo says nothing.					GARAK			You have to admit, this is certainly 			better than a prison cell.					ODO			There are forcefields around the 			bulkheads and a guard outside the 			door.  Sounds like a prison cell to 			me.         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE         11.7    CONTINUED:					GARAK			I see your point.

So save us 			both some trouble and leave me alone.					GARAK			Why Constable, you seem positively 			disappointed in me.	Odo harumphs.					GARAK				(sarcastic)			Well, I suppose it's understandable.  			After all, I did pledge my undying 			devotion and eternal allegiance to 			both you and the Federation.  And 			you and I've been through so much 			together... shared so many 			experiences... I know you considered 			me a close friend.  No wonder you 			feel betrayed.					ODO			You're wasting your time, Garak.  I 			don't care about the rationalizations 			you've come up with to justify your 			actions.					GARAK			Justify?  I don't need to justify 			anything to you.					ODO			Living on Deep Space Nine has made 			you a little rusty... your lies are 			becoming more transparent.  You should 			be careful -- you don't want Tain to 			know that you're feeling guilty about 			what you've done.					GARAK			You are imaginative, Constable, I'll 			grant you that.  But I suggest you 			put those creative powers to better 			use.       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - ACT ONE      12.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK (Cont'd)			We would like you to share your... 			unique insights on the Founders.					ODO			Would you?					GARAK			We would be most grateful for any 			information you could provide.					ODO			And if I refuse...					GARAK			Really Odo, you must stop reading 			those human crime novels that Chief 			O'Brien gives you.  It's poisoning 			your thinking.  I'm not here to 			threaten you -- I just want to talk.					ODO			I don't feel like talking.					GARAK			Surely you can see that we have a 			common enemy: the Founders.  By 			cooperating, you'll be helping us 			provide security for the entire Alpha 			Quadrant.					ODO			The only common enemy you and I share 			is Enabran Tain.  The difference 			between you and I is that you don't 			know it.	The two men share a look for a long moment.					GARAK			I suggest you think over what I've 			said, Constable.					ODO			That's funny...

However that will give 			them enough time to stage some kind 			of counterattack against the Alpha 			Quadrant so I suggest you place the 			Cardassian fleet on alert.	Worried looks go around the table as Tain pauses on the 	viewer.					TAIN				(continuing)			I take this action not in defiance 			of the Cardassian state, but in 			defense of it.  You in the Central 			Command have neglected the security 			of our people and allowed peace with 			Bajor and the Federation to blind 			you to the real threat: the Dominion.  			I intend to remove that threat.  Let 			history be my judge.	The recording ENDS and is replaced by the symbol of the 	Obsidian Order, and then by image of VICE ADMIRAL TODDMAN of 	Starfleet Security.  Toddman is a man in his late fifties 	and has a gruff, dour manner.					TODDMAN			That message was intercepted by a 			Federation outpost earlier today.  A 			similar message was sent to the 			Romulan Senate.  Both governments 			are denying any prior knowledge of 			Tain's plan and are calling this a 			rogue operation.					BASHIR			Are they going to do anything to 			stop Tain?	Toddman peers at Bashir for a moment, as if remembering 	something.       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/16/95 - ACT ONE     13A.9    CONTINUED:					TODDMAN			Doctor Bashir, isn't it?					BASHIR			Yes, sir.					TODDMAN			You are in trouble.					BASHIR			Sir?					TODDMAN			I bet two cases of Saurian Brandy 			that you were going to win the 			Carrington Award this year.  You 			lost, which means I lost.  And I 			don't like to lose.	Bashir is at something of a loss here... he has no idea what 	to say.					BASHIR			I'm... sorry, admiral.					TODDMAN			Good.  Now to answer your question, 			both the Romulans and the Cardassians 			claim to be studying ways to stop 			Tain.  But we believe that they're 			going to sit back and wait to see if 			he succeeds or not.       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/15/95 - ACT ONE      14.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX			But sir, that could plunge both 			Romulus and Cardassia into war with 			the Dominion.					TODDMAN			Only if he fails, Lieutenant.  And 			it looks like his plan has a fair 			chance of success.  He's commanding 			a fleet of twenty ships manned by 			combat veterans.  They know the 			location of the Founders' homeworld 			and they've modified their cloaks so 			the Jem'Hadar can't detect their 			approach.					KIRA			You sound like you're hoping Tain 			will succeed.					TODDMAN				(sharp)			I never hope for war, Major.  But if 			it comes... I'd rather see the 			Dominion on the losing side.				(takes a deep breath, 				looks more grim)			But we have to be prepared for the 			worst.  Ben, I want you to evacuate 			DS Nine of all non-essential personnel 			and have the Defiant on standby 			alert.  Even if Tain succeeds, the 			Jem'Hadar are going to come screaming 			out of the wormhole looking for 			revenge and they may not be too 			particular about who their targets 			are.					SISKO			Admiral, we believe Security Chief 			Odo is aboard one of the Romulan 			ships.         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE         15.9    CONTINUED:	(3)					EDDINGTON			Odo's message said that the runabout 			had been caught in a tractor beam, 			sir.  That suggests he was captured 			and taken aboard one of their ships.					SISKO			I'd like permission to take the 			Defiant into the Gamma Quadrant and 			try to determine if he's still alive 			and --					TODDMAN			The answer's no, Ben.  I'm sorry 			about your officer, but there's 			nothing we can do.  I want the Defiant 			guarding Bajor.  That's your top 			priority.  Toddman out.	The transmission ENDS.  There's a long quiet moment.					SISKO			Commander Eddington, am I correct in 			assuming that Starfleet is sending 			substantial reinforcements to this 			sector?					EDDINGTON			Yes, sir.  A task force of nine 			starships is due to arrive tomorrow.					SISKO			Nine starships...				(beat, then to all)			I want the Defiant ready to leave 			for the Gamma Quadrant in two hours.					EDDINGTON			Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were 			quite clear and...					SISKO				(cutting him off)			I'm not going to just abandon one of 			my officers.  Toddman's concerned 			about the defense of Bajor -- so am 			I.         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT ONE        15A.9    CONTINUED:	(4)					SISKO			If we detect a Jem'Hadar strike force 			heading for the Alpha Quadrant, we'll 			use the Communications Relay to warn 			DS Nine, and we'll do everything we 			can to stop them before they reach 			the wormhole.				(beat)			I consider this a volunteer mission.				(to all)			But, don't volunteer yet.

You mean if you run into 			the Jem'Hadar.					DAX			It's a possibility.	Quark stops her, fixes her with a sincere and heartfelt look.					QUARK			Just... be careful, Lieutenant.

ROMULAN BRIDGE	This is a different type of ship from the typical warbird -- 	it is used exclusively by the Tal Shiar -- and the design 	and decor of the room should reflect that.  There are Romulan 	N.D.s manning the consoles and there's a PILOT at the helm.  	The Bridge is DARK, indicating the cloaking device is in 	operation.  Garak, Lovok, and Tain are examining a tactical 	map on one of the consoles.					LOVOK				(pointing to map)			We know the Founders' planet lies at 			approximately these coordinates within 			the Omarion nebula.  As you can see, 			there are no Jem'Hadar bases nearby.  			That means that even if the Founders 			do send out a distress call, it would 			take at least seven hours before any 			help could arrive.         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT TWO         21.18   CONTINUED:					TAIN				(to Garak)			Our plan is to wait until we've 			entered orbit of the Founders' planet, 			then decloak and begin a massive 			bombardment.					LOVOK			Computer analysis indicates that the 			planet's crust will be destroyed 			within one hour, and the mantle within 			five.					GARAK			That should more than take care of 			the Founders...					TAIN			Yes, it should.  Unless they have 			some planetary defenses we don't 			know about.  And the only person 			here who might know the answer to 			that question is Mister Odo.					GARAK			Anything he knows about the Founders 			and their planet was undoubtedly 			included in his report to Starfleet.  			The constable is remarkably thorough 			in these matters.	Tain frowns at Garak's evasion.					TAIN			There was a time when you were eager 			to begin an interrogation, Elim.  In 			fact, I remember having to restrain 			your... enthusiasm on several 			occasions.					GARAK			I do remember having a certain... 			pride in my work.  But I doubt that 			interrogating someone who can alter 			their form at will is likely to 			provide either amusement or 			information.       DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/16/95 - ACT TWO      22.18   CONTINUED:	(2)					TAIN			I wouldn't worry about Mister Odo's 			shape-shifting if I were you.

Garak is lost in 	thought... clearly disturbed by something.  Tain watches him 	for a moment, then turns to Lovok.					TAIN				(to Lovok)			Perhaps the Tal Shiar should take 			over the interrogation of the 			changeling.				(off Garak's reaction)			It's all right, Garak.  It's my fault.  			I should've known that you'd develop 			feelings for the people you lived 			with for the past few years.				(beat)			I just never expected that you would 			become friends with someone who worked 			for the Bajorans.					GARAK			This has nothing to do with my 			"friends" or my "feelings."  I simply 			don't believe he has the information 			you want.					TAIN			Possibly.

OFF Sisko's pleased reaction...									CUT TO:         DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - 02/14/95 - ACT FIVE       53A.52   INT. GARAK'S SHOP	The shop is still ruined from the explosion.  Nothing has 	been repaired or cleaned up.  Garak is poking about in the 	rubble, contemplating the destruction.  After a beat, he 	turns and finds Odo standing in the doorway, watching him.  	Odo eyes him evenly, and says without preamble...					ODO			I read the report you wrote... and I 			wanted to thank you.					GARAK				(surprised)			Me?  For what?					ODO			For not mentioning my... desire to 			return to my people.					GARAK			I consider the entire conversation 			as... something best forgotten.					ODO			As do I.	There's a beat and then Odo takes a few steps in the wreckage.					ODO				(continuing)			Quark has expressed an interest in 			renting this space if you're not 			going to be using it.					GARAK			Oh?      DEEP SPACE: "The Die is Cast" - REV. 02/16/95 - ACT FIVE      54.52   CONTINUED:					ODO			He mentioned something about an 			Argelian massage facility.					GARAK			Unfortunately, I don't think Commander 			Sisko will approve of such an... 			interesting facility on the Promenade.					ODO			I tend to agree.  But I think he 			would approve of... a tailor's shop.	There's a quiet beat as Garak looks over the ruins.					GARAK			You know what the sad part is, Odo... 			I'm a pretty good tailor.	Odo nods and then heads for the door.  He pauses on the 	threshold.					ODO			Garak... I was thinking that... we 			should have breakfast together... 			sometime.					GARAK				(surprised)			Why, Constable... I thought you didn't 			eat.					ODO			I don't.	There's a quiet moment and then Garak nods his head in 	acknowledgment of Odo's unspoken invitation for something 	that might be akin to friendship and Odo nods back.  Odo 	EXITS, leaving Garak alone to contemplate his future.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
