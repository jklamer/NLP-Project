QUARK'S BAR (OPTICAL)	A typical evening crowd, SUPERNUMERARIES as needed. 	QUARK is behind the bar, making drinks. MORN is seated 	at his usual stool, pouring the dregs from a BOTTLE of 	Yridian Ale into his glass. ODO ENTERS and approaches 	him.					ODO				(dry) 			If you're not too busy, I'd 			appreciate it if you did something 			about that shipment of Livanian 			beets you have sitting in Cargo 			Bay Three.	Morn ignores him, takes a sip of his drink. At the far 	end of the bar we see Quark settle in to watch Odo's 	encounter with Morn -- for some reason he finds it 	amusing.					ODO				(getting annoyed) 			It's been there for over two 			weeks. It's starting to rot.				(no reaction) 			Morn.	Exasperated, Odo turns to Quark, who approaches as if 	he doesn't know what could be wrong with Morn. Odo 	reaches over to touch Morn's shoulder, and his hand 	PASSES through it -- Morn is a hologram. Odo reacts 	with surprise.					QUARK				(enjoying this) 			It's a hologram.				(off Odo's look) 			Morn's been away on business for 			the last two weeks.	Odo frowns, doesn't know what to make of this					QUARK 			You're slipping, Odo. You 			should've caught on a lot sooner.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Who Mourns...

People love him. 			He's like a mascot. Everyone 			expects to see him when they come 			in here. If they don't, it 			doesn't feel like home to them.					ODO			And that's not good for business.					QUARK			The last time he went away sales 			dropped almost five percent.					ODO				(studying "Morn") 			Why doesn't it talk?					QUARK			Do you have any idea how much an 			interactive holo-projector costs?				(sotto, so Bashir and				O'Brien can't hear)			Besides, it's a relief not to have			to listen to him go on. You know			Morn, he never shuts up.				(re: the hologram) 			I'd trade this for the real thing 			any day.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Who Mourns...

I hate to think of the 			big fella going without.	Bashir nods his agreement, and they head inside. As 	they pass WORF and Dax, we DROP off on them.OB   WORF AND DAX 	She's holding a large alien-looking FRUIT that she 	knows to be Morn's favorite. Worf is doing his best to 	comfort her.					WORF 			Morn was an excellent sparring 			partner. I will miss our weekly 			combat in the holosuites.					DAX			I can't believe he's really gone.	Dax starts to get a little teary eyed --     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Who Mourns...

I thought it might come			in handy.	Kira glances at the bottle in her hand, catches on --					KIRA				(smiles)			Very thoughtful.	Odo smiles, pleased with the gift he picked out... as	they head into Quark's...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Who Mourns...

A PORTRAIT of 	Morn is propped on the bar, surrounded by a cornucopia 	of food and drink -- we see fruit, bottles of wine and 	ale, cans and jars of delicacies, and something that 	looks like a three-legged roast turkey.	Quark is talking to THREE FERENGI waiters -- he's both 	amazed and pleased by the sight of the surprisingly 	large crowd.					QUARK			This is unbelievable. Look at all			these people.				(to waiters, sotto)			If you see anyone emptyhanded			sell them a bottle of Yridian Ale.	Quark motions to a cache of ale bottles he's set up to 	be sold.					QUARK			Tell them it was Morn's favorite.	The waiters nod and hurry off to ply the crowd. Quark 	looks around at the crowd with relish until Bashir and 	O'Brien approach him -- the Ferengi instantly puts on 	a somber face.					BASHIR			It was kind of you to do this,			Quark.					O'BRIEN			Morn would've appreciated it.					QUARK			It's the least I could do.	Quark doesn't notice Odo hovering behind him --					QUARK				("choked up")			I'll miss him.	Bashir puts a reassuring hand to Quark's shoulder --					QUARK				("recovering")			I'm sorry.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Who Mourns... " - REV. 11/13/97 - ACT ONE      5.2    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			Can I get you something?					QUARK 			I don't ordinarily imbibe on the 			job. But maybe a Yridian Ale. It 			was Morn's favorite, you know.	O'Brien reacts to this information --					O'BRIEN 				(to Bashir) 			Perfect.	Bashir nods, and the two men move off. Quark smiles to 	himself, turns and comes face to face with Odo, who 	gives him a knowing look.					QUARK 			What are you looking at?					ODO 			Your respect for the dead is 			heartwarming.					QUARK 				(sotto) 			I'll have you know that Morn died 			without paying this month's tab.					ODO 			How inconsiderate of him.					QUARK 			We're talking about a lot of 			money. The man had quite an 			appetite -- he had two stomachs to 			fill, you know.				(fondly) 			Did you ever watch him eat? It 			was a beautiful thing.					ODO 			Sometimes you don't truly 			appreciate what you have until 			it's gone.					QUARK 			It's not funny. This service is 			my only chance to cover my losses.					ODO 			Morn seemed to be a fairly 			successful businessman.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Who Mourns...

By the time 			they divvy everything up, I doubt 			there'll be much left.					QUARK 			It's nice to know you're so 			worried about my welfare.					ODO 			You should be worried, too. Now 			that your mascot is gone, business 			is going to suffer.					QUARK 			We'll see.				(sure of himself) 			You might be surprised.	And with that, Quark turns and moves away.

I'll never 			forget the first time he walked in 			here and sat down on this very 			stool. It must've been almost ten 			years ago -- he still had his hair 			then. I thought he was just 			another customer passing through. 			Little did I know that he'd become 			such an important figure in my 			life, in all our lives. Someone 			we could count on for a cheerful 			smile and an entertaining story. 			Some of you might be thinking that 			this place won't be the same 			without him.

For Morn.	And with that, Quark has to stop lest he lose it 	entirely. A moment, then the crowd breaks into 	applause.5    ODO AND KIRA	She is visibly touched.					KIRA 			Every now and then, Quark really 			surprises me...	Odo frowns because he can see that Quark pulled off a 	nice trick --					ODO 			Me, too.	Off Odo's face...6    QUARK	sitting at the bar, drowning his "sorrows" in the ample 	bosom of a distraught DABO GIRL.

He paid his bar 			bill at the end of every month -- 			that kind of money must've come 			from somewhere.					ODO				("considers") 			He did have his shipping business. 			Maybe all his assets are tied up 			in inventory?	Quark leaps on this, not realizing that Odo is leading 	him on a wild goose chase.					QUARK 			Of course!

In the 	blink of an eye, Quark finds himself in the middle of 	a four-way standoff -- Hain has his weapon on Krit, 	Krit has his on Larell, Larell has hers on Nahsk, who 	has his on Hain. A tense moment, then...					QUARK 			All right, someone else count it.	Another tense beat, then Krit smiles.					KRIT 			Put it down, Hain. My brother may 			be slow, but if you pull the 			trigger, he'll kill you.	A beat, then Hain prepares to lower his weapon. 	Suddenly, to Krit's astonishment, Nahsk swings his 	weapon around and trains it on his brother. Larell and 	Hain are so nonplussed they're not sure where they 	should point their weapons.					NAHSK 			I'm not slow.					KRIT			Nahsk... ?	As Nahsk squeezes the trigger, Krit dives out of the 	way so that the BLAST hits him on the shoulder. All 	hell breaks loose as the four start FIRING at each 	other and scrambling for cover.

CRATE (OPTICAL)	as Quark cowers inside it, oblivious to the fact that 	he's sitting amidst a fortune in gold-pressed latinum. 	The SOUND of phaser fire continues, punctuated by 	SHOUTED REMARKS between the former partners and the 	occasional YELP of pain when someone gets hit.					QUARK				(quiet)			Go ahead, kill each other...	Quark starts to feel a little safer inside the shelter 	of the crate. Just as he reaches to pick up a brick of 	latinum, a phaser BLAST pierces the crate wall and 	barely misses him. He immediately forgets the latinum 	and has the good sense to keep cowering.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Who Mourns...
