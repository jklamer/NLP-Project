Jem'Hadar THIRD LAMAT'UKAN labors over the 	science station; Ixtana'Rax mans the helm.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little...

On the viewscreen, the Dominion attack ship 	is visible, just off of the Defiant's starboard bow. 	The Bridge door opens and Jem'Hadar FIRST KUDAK'ETAN 	strides in. He's an imposing figure, with vigor to his 	stride and an utter certainty that every step he takes 	is the right one. At his appearance Ixtana'Rax and the 	others snap to attention.					IXTANA'RAX 			The bridge is secure.	Kudak'Etan comes to a stop beside the Captain's Chair. 	He pauses to regard it as if it is an alien object, 	which it is. He reaches out and gives it a push, 	watching with fascination as it slowly swivels.					KUDAK'ETAN 			Tactical report.					IXTANA'RAX 			Their bridge officers are confined 			in the mess hall; other survivors 			in the cargo bay. We will have 			impulse power back on line in 			thirty minutes, but it will take 			several hours to restore warp 			capability.					KUDAK'ETAN 			It must be gratifying for an 			"Elder," to end his career with a 			victory.				(sarcastic) 			I feel privileged to be here with 			you at such a moment.	Ixtana'Rax regards Kudak'Etan with distaste. He's 	earned his title, but hearing it from this man grates 	on him.					IXTANA'RAX 			There is still much to do before 			we declare victory. Until we 			leave Federation space, we are 			vulnerable to --					KUDAK'ETAN				(hard)			I am the First.

He does not yet turn 	toward the camera on the Jem'Hadar bridge. The image 	from the Defiant's Bridge is projected from the VR 	device into his eye, so he does not need to face us to 	address his men.					GELNON 			Ah, First. Your report?					KUDAK'ETAN 			The Defiant is ours.					GELNON				(smiles) 			Good. Very, very good. I must 			admit, I was initially quite 			skeptical about you and the other 			new Jem'Hadar bred in this 			quadrant. But this is a most 			impressive debut.				(he turns toward camera) 			Wouldn't you agree, Elder?					IXTANA'RAX				(even) 			The takeover of the ship was 			competently executed.					GELNON				(enjoying it) 			Do I detect a note of jealousy in 			your voice?

If 			not for us, you would've never --					GELNON 			You two can argue about this on 			your own time.				(to the First) 			First, how long until you restore 			warp power?					KUDAK'ETAN 			I am about to assess the damage. 			I will make a complete survey of 			the ship and give you a report in 			one hour.					GELNON 			Very well. I await your report.	The communication terminates and the Viewscreen returns 	to the image of the Dominion ship. Kudak'Etan turns to 	his Second.					KUDAK'ETAN 			Bring me Captain Sisko.	Ixtana'Rax doesn't want to be needlessly 	confrontational, but is hoping to steer this kid in the 	right direction.					IXTANA'RAX 			I would suggest to you that his 			execution can wait until we have 			completed repairs to the ship.					KUDAK'ETAN 			I'm not going to execute him.	Ixtana'Rax looks at him in surprise.					KUDAK'ETAN 			Are you about to question my 			orders...

Kudak'Etan turns to his 	Third.					KUDAK'ETAN 			Find the ship's transponder and 			shut it down -- I don't want 			anyone tracking us. And get these 			chairs off the bridge.11   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL	Worf paces the room like a caged tiger. Sisko leans 	against one wall, lost in thought. All of our crew 	have been stripped of their combadges. They're 	frustrated and edgy. Kira sits at one of the mess 	tables, allowing Nog to clean her injury with a napkin. 	He hits a sensitive spot. She winces and pushes his 	arm away more brusquely than she intended.					KIRA			That's enough. Thanks.					WORF				(still pacing) 			I should've foreseen this. I 			should have sent out 			reconnaissance probes to scan for 			enemy ships. Or a shuttle. Or 			re-calibrated our sensors. If 			I had, Jadzia would...	Worf falls silent, raises his fist as if to slam it 	into a bulkhead, then lowers his clenched fingers to 	his side.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little...

First of all, 			we don't know what happened to the 			Rubicon. They might've gotten out 			of the anomaly on their own. If 			they did, they could be halfway 			home and in a lot better shape 			than we are. So let's just hold 			off analyzing our mistakes for 			now.					KIRA			If they restore warp power, we'll 			be analyzing them in a Dominion 			prison camp.	Her words spark the germ of an idea in Sisko's mind.					SISKO 			Restoring warp power may not be so 			simple for them. It took us a 			week just to learn how to pilot 			one of their ships. So we might 			still have a chance to retake the 			Defiant. But we can't do anything 			unless we get out of this room. 				(looks at them) 			Suggestions?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little...

OPTRONIC CIRCUITY - CLOSE ON O'BRIEN 	He's wrestling an optronic FILAMENT -- a translucent 	tube as thick as a fire hydrant, pulsating with colored 	light -- into a SOCKET.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little... " - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FIVE     56.87   CONTINUED:	Once O'Brien gets the filament in place, he TWISTS it, 	and the filament LOCKS into place.	He leans against the socket for a moment, panting and 	sweating. More effects of hypoxia are starting to 	manifest themselves -- short, rapid breathing, slightly 	blue lips, dizziness and fatigue. O'Brien struggles to 	stay conscious and he turns to see...88   BASHIR (OPTICAL) 	who's working across the way from O'Brien. Bashir is 	struggling mightily to UNLOCK another filament. He can 	barely speak.					BASHIR 			Stuck...	O'Brien moves to help. With his added force they TWIST 	the filament and it is released from the socket. Multi-	colored light sprays from the ferruled ends of the 	filaments.					BASHIR 			Which... one... ?	O'Brien looks around at the empty sockets across from 	them, trying to orient himself, but it's not easy. He 	finally points to one.					O'BRIEN 			That... no.				(points to another one) 			That.					BASHIR			You... sure... ?	O'Brien hesitates, then nods. They begin to drag the 	filament, but it's like dragging a heavy firehouse in 	their present condition. Finally they shove the 	filament into the socket. They push it into place... 	TWIST it, but instead of locking, the filament pops 	back out again.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little... " - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FIVE     57.88   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			Dammit!				(groping for words)			Again... then... I'll...	O'Brien pulls out his phaser and Bashir seems to 	understand what he means. It takes all of his effort, 	but Bashir manages to shove the filament back into the 	socket.	O'Brien then FIRES a short controlled BLAST into the 	junction, FUSING the parts together. Bashir tests the 	joint with a hefty tug. It holds and Bashir collapses 	onto the deck. O'Brien sags against the wall and hits 	his combadge, he's just one short step away from 	passing out.					O'BRIEN				(panting) 			Rub... Rubicon... mi... mi... 			mission... complete...89   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM - NOG	He's still cranking data into the keyboard when the 	blinkies change and Nog's eyes suddenly light up. He 	can't quite believe it.					NOG 			Oh, I am good.	But before Nog can do anything further, the Jem'Hadar 	Seventh grabs him by the back of his jacket and yanks 	him away from the keypad.					IXTANA'RAX (O.S.)				(over above action) 			All of you, step away from the 			consoles. Right now!90   THE ENGINE ROOM	The Seventh half-drags the Ferengi toward the forward 	operations station, where the Fifth herds the rest of 	our Defiant crew into a line facing the station.	Kira comes to a stop against the wall by the starboard 	engineering display. Worf moves in next to her, and 	then Sisko. The Sixth has his weapon trained on our 	crew from the catwalk. Below him, Ixtana'Rax considers 	the readouts on the warp control pedestal. (NOTE: 	There is now an N.D. Jem'Hadar Fourth in the room as 	well.)      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little... " - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FIVE     58.90   CONTINUED:	The Seventh thrusts Nog roughly into line next to 	Sisko, then starts for the pedestal. Nog leans close 	to the captain.					NOG				(sotto) 			Captain. I did it! I don't know 			how, but I released the command 			codes.					SISKO				(sotto) 			Well done. What we need now is a 			diversion before they go to warp.					IXTANA'RAX 			Silence!91   INT. RUNABOUT	O'Brien and Bashir are now back in the runabout, 	gratefully sucking in the air and feeling much better. 	O'Brien works one of the side consoles while Dax looks 	over his shoulder.					O'BRIEN 			All the Defiant's command 			functions have been transferred to 			Engineering.				(frowns) 			But nothing's happening.					BASHIR 			Maybe the captain hasn't realized 			he has control of the ship yet.	Beat.					DAX 			Or maybe he's in trouble. The 			First was called to the engine 			room a few minutes ago.	They exchange a look and then Dax and O'Brien quickly 	move back to the pilot controls.92   INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM	The Fifth now stands next to the Engineering display, 	guarding the prisoners. Ixtana'Rax stands between the 	Defiant's crew and the forward operations console. 	Kudak'Etan is facing his Second and he's not happy.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little... " - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FIVE     59.92   CONTINUED:					KUDAK'ETAN 			How long has the warp drive been 			repaired?					IXTANA'RAX 			At least one hour, maybe longer.	Kudak'Etan stares at the prisoners, then back at his 	Second.					KUDAK'ETAN 			And they managed to conceal it 			from you.					IXTANA'RAX 			You ordered me not to interfere 			with them.					KUDAK'ETAN 			I also told you to watch them 			carefully.					IXTANA'RAX 			If we had assigned Jem'Hadar to do 			the repairs, as I said --					KUDAK'ETAN 			I'm not interested in your 			excuses.	Kudak'Etan turns to the Seventh at the Operations 	Station.					KUDAK'ETAN 			Bring the warp drive on-line.					IXTANA'RAX 			Wait!	The Seventh hesitates, looking from the Second to the 	First, not sure what he should do. Kudak'Etan holds up 	his hand to indicate the Seventh can wait.					IXTANA'RAX 			Before we activate the warp drive 			we should check the entire system 			for possible sabotage.					KUDAK'ETAN 			That would take hours. Every 			minute we spend in Federation 			space exposes us to detection and 			attack.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little... " - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FIVE     60.92   CONTINUED:					KUDAK'ETAN (Cont'd)				(sarcastic) 			And I would hate for your last 			mission to end in failure, 			"Elder."				(nods to the Seventh) 			Do it.	The Seventh works the panel. The warp core RAMPS UP TO 	A HEALTHY GLOW.					KUDAK'ETAN 			When you have sufficient engine 			power available, bring us to warp 			four.	Kira, Nog, Worf and Sisko exchange glances.					KIRA				(sotto) 			At least we're going to take them 			with us.					KUDAK'ETAN 				(to the Second) 			Secure them with the other 			prisoners.	The First strides toward the door as Kudak'Etan motions 	for our heroes to begin moving.93   KUDAK'ETAN (OPTICAL)	He reaches the Engine Room door. As it opens, the 	First's eyes widen at the sight of the tiny Rubicon 	rocketing straight toward his head! He dodges out of 	the way and starts to bring up his disruptor.	Everything happens very quickly.	Kudak'Etan FIRES at the Runabout, but misses.94   THE RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)	A tiny PHOTON TORPEDO rips out from the ship and HITS 	the Fifth as he turns toward it. He spins and falls to 	the deck, stone dead.95   KIRA	dives for the dead Jem'Hadar's weapon.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little... " - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FIVE     61. 96   KUDAK'ETAN (OPTICAL)	has turned his back to the prisoners as he tries to 	shoot the little ship. Big mistake. Worf leaps on 	him, throws an arm around his throat, and snaps the	Jem'Hadar's neck. The Fourth takes a phaser shot at 	Worf, but misses. Worf goes after him in a brutal 	hand-to-hand fight --97   INT. RUNABOUT	The crew is at battle stations, working feverishly.					O'BRIEN			Dax! At the upper rail!					DAX			I've got him.98   OVER THE UPPER GUARD'S SHOULDER (OPTICAL)	The Runabout banks and climbs toward him. The guard 	shoots at it and misses, sending...99   SISKO AND NOG	ducking out of his line of fire.99A  THE JEM'HADAR ON THE CATWALK (OPTICAL)	(FORMERLY SCENE 103)	FIRES at the Rubicon and the runabout is forced to bank 	and turn to avoid the blasts.99A  INT. RUNABOUT 	As the ship lurches and turns, the three occupants hang 	on for dear life.					DAX				(working)			This guy is really starting to get			on my nerves.					BASHIR			I've got torpedo lock!					DAX			Fire!      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little...

The torpedo catches him in the 	chest and he topples over the railing to the Engine 	Room deck, his disruptor bouncing toward...99B  SISKO AND NOG	(FORMERLY SCENE 104)	Nog dives for the weapon, while Sisko heads for the	forward Ops station.100  SECOND IXTANA'RAX	aims his weapon at Sisko.101  KIRA (OPTICAL)	She comes up to a kneeling position with the disruptor 	and pulls the trigger.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little... " - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FIVE     62.102  IXTANA'RAX (OPTICAL) 	He takes Kira's BLAST full in the chest and goes down.103thru   OMITTED104105  AT THE OPERATIONS CONSOLE (OPTICAL)	As Sisko approaches it, the unarmed Seventh lunges at 	him and takes a swing. Sisko deflects the blow and 	pivots the Jem'Hadar toward Kira, who shoots him. 	Sisko turns and begins entering command codes into the 	console.105A WORF	Kills the Jem'Hadar Fourth.106  NOG	stands. He swivels the disruptor around, looking for	trouble.107  THE ENGINE ROOM - WIDER (OPTICAL)	Kira rises to her feet. Worf has the First's disruptor 	and covers the doors. All the Jem'Hadar are down. 	Sisko is working the Ops console.					SISKO 			I'm flooding all compartments 			except the engine room with 			anesthezine gas.				(to Kira) 			Get that virus out of the computer 			before somebody on the bridge 			decides to engage the warp drive.	Kira begins working another console. Sisko walks over 	to where Ixtana'Rax sits on the floor, his back against 	the warp control pedestal. The Second clutches his 	wound, his breathing labored, his eyes focused intently 	on the body of Kudak'Etan. Finally, he becomes aware 	of Sisko's presence and looks up.					SISKO				(re: Kudak'Etan) 			He should've listened to you and 			killed me when he had the chance.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little...

Obedience brings... 			Victory... and Victory is...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little... " - REV. 1/9/98 - ACT FIVE     63.107  CONTINUED:	(2)	Then the struggle ends. Life ebbs out of his eyes and 	he slumps over, dead. Sisko turns away in time to see 	the little Rubicon whiz by, then arc up into a perfect 	Immelmann turn and come to a stop about six inches in 	front of Worf's nose.					SISKO 				(smiles) 			Mister Worf -- I think your wife's 			here.107A THE RUNABOUT (OPTICAL) 	From over Worf's shoulder, we can see the tiny figure 	of Dax waving at Worf.107B RESUME WORF	As he smiles.108  EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	The Defiant is again docked at the station.					SISKO (V.O.) 			Captain's Log, Stardate 51492.3. 			After completing repairs, we were 			able to return to the anomaly and 			successfully restore our runabout 			and its crew to their normal size. 			The surviving Jem'Hadar have been 			transferred to a Federation P.O.W. 			camp.109  INT. QUARK'S	Dax is sitting at a table, as Worf sits down with a 	PADD in his hand.					DAX 			Is that your poem?					WORF 			Yes.	A Ferengi waiter comes by the table.					WORF 			Bloodwine.	Beat.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little...

But this is my first			poem.					DAX			I understand.					WORF			I have worked very hard and very			long on this.					DAX			I know.					WORF			And I do not wish to be...			ridiculed.					DAX			I promise.					WORF				(grudging)			Very well.				(reads with majesty)			"This is the story... of the			little ship... that took a little			trip."				(serious)			What do you think?	She blinks at him, not sure what to say.					DAX			It's... uh... well... it rhymes.	She looks at him for a moment, all innocence... then 	she notices that there's a twinkle in his eye and a 	smile lurking around the edges of his mouth... and she 	suddenly realizes that he's putting her on.					DAX			You're putting me on!	She grabs the PADD from his hand as he lets out a 	laugh.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "One Little...

We were so close you 			could see the veins throbbing in 			his eyeballs.	Odo stands behind the two men and looks them up and 	down, as if he's noticed something incongruous. Bashir 	glances at him, mildly irked by the Constable's intense 	gaze. O'Brien presses on with the tale and Bashir 	tries to ignore Odo.					O'BRIEN				(using his hands to 				demonstrate) 			We swung around and ducked behind 			the operations console.
