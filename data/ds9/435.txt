Torture is 			another.					ALIXUS			The first thing this community 			accepted was the need to establish 			rules of conduct.  All of us, 			including Stephan here, approved 			this form of punishment as necessary 			and fair.	Alixus turns away from Sisko, faces Stephan, takes his hand 	in both her own.

From the 	compound, a bell rings... it's a call.  People begin to move 	from whatever they're doing to the center of the compound... 	Sisko gets up, exhausted, moves into the compound... when 	all have gathered... we may note that Vinod and O'Brien are 	not present...					ALIXUS			Meg has died.	Gasps... some begin to cry... all are somber...					ALIXUS			It happened suddenly, quietly.

Sisko 	reacts... moves to him...					ALIXUS			All of us have welcomed our new 			arrivals with open arms... but they 			continue to reject us.  Despite their 			agreement to respect our fundamental 			way of life, this man has committed 			the worst offense that can be 			committed against this community.  			He has selfishly wasted precious 			time that could have been put to 			productive use.

I knew you would 			feel that way and I'm glad you said 			it.  So all of us could see the true 			danger these two represent.  Our own 			Joseph defending what he knows is 			wrong.  He knows if we had spent our 			energy all these years trying to 			escape, we would all be dead today.				(shakes her head sadly)			This is good.  This is a test of our 			convictions.  And we will survive.  			To honor Meg and the others who have 			died to create this community.  To 			honor the living who believe in this 			community.

You're his 			commanding officer.  I hold you 			responsible for his actions.  I'm 			putting you in there.	And now, it's O'Brien who struggles and is held back from 	moving to Sisko's defense... Sisko and Alixus hold each 	other's eyes for a long beat, and then Sisko turns, pushing 	Vinod out of the way and walks without threat to the box... 	turns once more to look at Alixus... and gets in.  The metal 	door CLANGS shut behind him... and is barred.
