SPACE (OPTICAL)	A JEM'HADAR FIGHTER is moving at impulse... then	suddenly EXPLODES. The explosion expands for a	beat... then FREEZES, and then REVERSES. The	recording FREEZES again at a point where the ship is	still mostly intact, but the first SPARK of an	explosion can be seen.	A HAND comes into frame and points to the SPARK.					KIRA'S VOICE			Right there.2    OMITTED3    WIDER (OPTICAL)	Where KIRA, DAMAR, GARAK and RUSOT are watching the	monitor.

Their			security checks could've found			the bomb and disarmed it before			the ship left orbit.					RUSOT			But they didn't find it.					KIRA			That's not the point. Your men			ignored their instructions and			their training.	Rusot bristles and Damar tries to defend him.					DAMAR			Let's not lose sight of the fact			that the mission was a success.					KIRA			It was a success because			Jem'Hadar security slipped up and			we got lucky.				(to Rusot)			Don't use those men again for			anything except routine			reconnaissance.					RUSOT			They're five of my best men!			Bronok is one of the most			experienced --					GARAK			You've been told before -- no			names!					KIRA				(strained patience)			Every cell has to be insulated			from the cell above and below.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into...

Why don't			we take a break.	Rusot pulls his temper back under control for Damar.					RUSOT			Good idea.				(pointed at Kira)			The air in here is getting stale.	Rusot stalks away and EXITS.					KIRA				(to Damar)			Are you going to do something			about him?					DAMAR			I am. I'm giving him my support.	Damar holds her eyes for a beat and Kira can see	that this is not the time for that particular	debate.					KIRA			All right.	Damar EXITS.					GARAK			That does not bode well.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into...

Although	Odo walks a bit gingerly and there's a slight strain	to his voice, there's no other outward sign of the	Shape-shifter disease. He hands her a PADD, but she	barely glances at it.					ODO			The raid on the Tevak shipyard			was successful. I penetrated the			Operations Center and disabled			the security protocols. The rest			of the team sabotaged the			dilithium storage bunkers. An			hour after we left, the entire			facility was vaporized.					KIRA			You should get some rest...					ODO			That sounds good to me...					KIRA				(to Garak)			Anyone in the bunkroom?					GARAK			No.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into...

And once he's gone, we can see that Kira	is really very worried about him.									CUT TO:5    INT. TUNNEL (OPTICAL)	As soon as Odo is out of sight from the main cavern,	he sags against the wall and we can see that he's	been putting up a brave front for everyone. He's	wracked with pain and on the verge of exhaustion.	He MORPHS into his true form -- a desiccated and	flaking body. He looks even worse than the last	time we saw the Female Shape-shifter. With a final	glance behind him, he heads painfully down the	Tunnel.6    INT. REBEL CAVERN	Kira is looking over a PADD.					KIRA			Starfleet Intelligence says that			a contingent of Breen engineers			arrived on Kelvas Five last week.			Breen engineers...				(beat)			Have we had any reports of Breen			ships in that system?					GARAK			No. As a matter of fact, no			Breen ships have been reported in			that entire sector.					KIRA			So why send engineers... ? Do you			have any contacts on Kelvas Five?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into... " - REV. 03/22/99 - TEASER     6.6    CONTINUED:					GARAK			No. But I think I know who			might. Excuse me.	Garak EXITS.									CUT TO:7    INT. SECOND CAVERN	Odo is sitting on one of the bunks, resting when	Garak ENTERS. Garak stops short at the sight of the	desiccated constable, surprised by his condition.	Garak shifts his weight and Odo whirls around.					ODO			It's just like you to come			sneaking in here without warning.					GARAK			My approach may have been quiet,			but I assure you, I had no			intention of "sneaking" up on			you. My apologies.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into... " - REV. 03/22/99 - TEASER     7.7    CONTINUED:	Garak looks him over for a beat.					GARAK			If I may ask... ?					ODO			Why have I... deteriorated so			rapidly? I've been assuming			dozens of different shapes over			the past few weeks. Changing			form seems to... accelerate the			progress of the disease.					GARAK			Perhaps you should stop.					ODO			And do what? Lie here and wait			to die? No, thank you. I'm here			to work and work is what I'm			going to do.					GARAK			I see.				(beat)			I take it that Commander Kira is			unaware of your... true			condition?					ODO			That's right. And I prefer that			it stay that way.					GARAK			I won't breath a word.					ODO			See that you don't. She has			enough on her mind without			worrying about me. And I don't			want her...					GARAK			Pity?	Odo looks away and clearly Garak is right.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into... " - REV. 03/22/99 - TEASER     8.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO			Is there a reason you came in			here?					GARAK			We have need of a contact on			Kelvas Five.

Maybe they can --					BASHIR			All that will do is alert Thirty-			one to that fact that we're onto			them. And you know what they'll			do next? They'll go deeper into			hiding and they'll probably send			someone here to destroy what			little headway I've made. No.			No more cloak and dagger games.			Science is the answer here.			Every puzzle has a solution,			every disease has a cure, it's			just a matter of finding it.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into...

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	GOWRON is storming around the office, while SISKO	tries to rein in his own temper.					GOWRON			Martok's attack on Avenal Seven			was a disgrace! He had the			advantage of surprise -- the			Dominion wasn't expecting us to			take the offensive so soon after			the Breen entered the war.			Avenal should've been an easy			victory for him, but instead he's			handed us a shameful defeat!	But Sisko is equally furious.					SISKO			General Martok and I both advised			you against attacking a world so			deep inside Dominion territory.			He was outnumbered six to one at			Avenal.					GOWRON				(dismissive)			Six to one. A good commander			finds ways to beat the odds, not			hide behind them.					SISKO			He didn't hide behind anything!			He fought harder and longer than			I would've in his place.

And			Martok himself is in critical			condition in the Rotarran			Sickbay.					GOWRON				(a shrug)			He's expected to survive.					SISKO			That's not the point. This whole			operation was a waste of			resources, men and equipment.			The blame lies with the man who			ordered the attack in the first			place, not with the man who tried			to carry it out.	The implication is clear and for a moment, Gowron's	eyes flash in return. But then Gowron shifts moods	quickly like the practiced politician that he is.	He smiles and puts a hand on Sisko's shoulder.					GOWRON			That's one of the things I like			about you, captain. Your loyalty			to your friends.					SISKO			This has nothing to do with			loyalty.					GOWRON				(patronizing)			Of course not. In any case, you			needn't worry. Martok's a...			popular general with the troops.			And that counts for something. I			won't relieve him of command...			yet.				(beat)			His flagship won't return to the			station for three days. That			should give me time to finalize			plans for our next operation.					SISKO			Chancellor, we can't afford to			keep wasting ships in these			reckless attacks!	Gowron fixes him with a steely gaze.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into...

CARDASSIA PRIME (MATTE SHOT)	Establishing.12   INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM	WEYOUN, THOT PRAN and the FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER are	looking over information on one of the wall	monitors. (No N.D.s in the b.g.)					WEYOUN			... and as you can see, the			Klingon raid on Avenal was easily			broken up.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER			I am less concerned about a			Klingon attack than I am about			this Cardassian rebellion. We			cannot fight the combined			military forces of the			Federation, the Klingons and the			Romulans while facing a full-			scale uprising behind the lines.					WEYOUN			I completely agree. However, the			situation is well in hand. We			still control the Cardassian			military, while Damar has only a			handful of terrorists at his			disposal. I can assure you both			that this "rebellion" poses no			threat.	Thot Pran issues a burst of STATIC.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into... " - REV. 03/22/99 - ACT ONE    15.12   CONTINUED:					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER				(to Weyoun, re: Thot Pran)			He's correct. You also assured			us that Damar would never turn			against the Dominion.	She gives him a withering look.					WEYOUN				(squirming)			That was an... error, to be sure.			But an understandable one. No one			could've foreseen that Damar would			become a terrorist. The concept			is antithetical to the very nature			of Cardassians. They respect			authority. They value the rule of			law and the security of order --			which is exactly what the Dominion			offers them.	The Female Shape-shifter just stares at him. Thot	Pran issues another BURST of STATIC. Weyoun glares	at him, but the Female Shape-shifter smiles in Thot	Pran's direction -- she's clearly still treating the	Breen with deference.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER				(to Thot Pran)			If our cloning facilities were			operational, I would eliminate			this Weyoun immediately.				(to Weyoun)			Damar must pay a price for his			treason. Redouble your efforts to			locate his wife and children.			Then begin interrogating			Cardassian teachers, scientists,			local officials... the population			has to understand in no uncertain			terms that dissent will not be			tolerated.				(beat)			I also want to begin putting			Cardassian civilians in and			around Dominion military			installations. If Damar destroys			another shipyard, he'll have to			kill a good number of his			countrymen in order to do it...			that should help turn the people			against him.					WEYOUN			An excellent plan.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into...

The			installation of Breen weapons			aboard Dominion ships should be			accelerated. Please issue the			appropriate orders to your			engineers.	Thot Pran nods and EXITS, leaving Weyoun alone in	the room with the Female Shape-shifter.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER			How long until the cloning			facilities are operational again?	Weyoun swallows hard.					WEYOUN			Not for... several days...			perhaps even weeks.					FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER			Keep me informed.	She EXITS. OFF Weyoun's expression...									CUT TO:13   INT. REBEL CAVERN	Garak is briefing Kira, Damar and Rusot.					GARAK			... and according to our new			contact on Kelvas Five, the Breen			will begin installing their			energy dampening weapons aboard			Jem'Hadar fighters within a week.					DAMAR				(to Kira)			Has the Federation made any			progress on counteracting these			weapons?					KIRA			They're still having trouble			understanding the underlying			technology.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Tacking into... " - REV. 03/22/99 - ACT ONE    17.13   CONTINUED:					DAMAR			Why aren't the Klingon ships			affected by these Breen weapons?					KIRA			We don't know that yet either.				(beat)			But, if we could supply the			Federation with one, it would			give them a chance to come up			with a countermeasure.					GARAK			I had the same thought.	Kira ignores the following Rusot/Damar exchange --	she's coming up with a plan.					RUSOT				(outraged)			Our priority should be to free			Cardassia from the Dominion, not			to do Starfleet's dirty work.					DAMAR			We're all in this together.

(Gowron is wearing his leader's CLOAK.)	Martok and Worf are here along with several N.D.	Klingon Admirals and Generals (both male and	female).
