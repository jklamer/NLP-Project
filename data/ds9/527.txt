SPACE - THE JEM'HADAR SHIP (OPTICAL)	The ship is moving at impulse power.					SISKO (V.O.) 			Captain's Log: Stardate 51107.2 			Our luck just ran out. Chief 			O'Brien had a plan to restore main 			power to our commandeered Dominion 			ship. All he needed were three 			more days. But he's not going to 			get them.2    INT. JEM'HADAR CONTROL ROOM	SISKO in command, DAX at the helm, NOG and O'BRIEN 	working feverishly at a large open panel. N.D. 	Crewmembers as needed. GARAK is wearing the virtual 	headset and is swiveling his head as he tries to focus 	on something outside the ship. The atmosphere is tense 	and urgent.					SISKO (V.O.)				(continuing) 			Sensors have detected two 			Jem'Hadar fighters heading our 			way. And without main power, our 			chances of survival are slim to 			none.					O'BRIEN				(to Dax) 			Try it now!					O'BRIEN				(to Nog) 			Re-route the damned gyrodyne to 			the damned thruster array.					NOG				(working) 			Got it.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			Where are those ships, Garak?					GARAK 			Bearing three one zero mark two 			five one. Still closing.	Sisko grabs the other virtual headset and puts it on.					O'BRIEN 			Nog did you re-route the damned 			gyrodyne?					NOG 			I'm trying, but the damned 			thruster array won't take the 			input!					O'BRIEN 			Try the lateral impulse matrix and 			watch your mouth.	Sisko activates the virtual headset and reacts to the 	dizzying view. He tries to adjust to the swirling 	image he sees.3    SISKO'S POV (OPTICAL)	An EXTERIOR view of space as seen from the Jem'Hadar 	ship. The stars whirl and turn for a moment as Sisko 	cranes his neck around... then the view focuses on two 	DISTANT SHIPS heading toward us.					O'BRIEN'S VOICE 				(over above) 			Access the auxiliary core through 			the starboard engineering console!      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - TEASER      3.3    CONTINUED:					DAX'S VOICE 				(over above) 			I've already tried that!4    RESUME SISKO	As he watches the ships grow larger in his viewer.					DAX 			There's still no power to weapons 			or shields!	Sisko thinks for a beat, then turns and "looks" around 	the ship. He sees something.					SISKO			Dax, there's a dark matter nebula 			sixty degrees above the bow. Can 			we reach it?					DAX				(works) 			Yes. But that nebula's never been 			charted. We don't know what's in 			there.					GARAK 			The Jem'Hadar ships are... 			entering weapons' range...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - TEASER      4.4    CONTINUED:	Sisko glances back into the virtual viewer.5thru   OMITTED67    SISKO'S POV (OPTICAL)	The Jem'Hadar ships are now much closer. They both 	OPEN FIRE, the bolts of disruptor energy coming right 	toward us...8    RESUME	The ship ROCKS under the impact. Sisko strips off the 	headset.					SISKO 			Take us into the nebula, old man. 			Full impulse!	Dax works quickly.9    EXT. SPACE - THE JEM'HADAR SHIP (OPTICAL)	The Jem'Hadar ship TURNS and heads toward the nebula.10   INT. JEM'HADAR CONTROL ROOM	As before. The ship ROCKS under the impact of another 	barrage from the pursuing vessels. Dax's console 	suddenly BLOWS OUT, knocking her across the room. 	Sisko rushes to her and O'Brien heads for the helm 	console. Dax has a nasty wound on her stomach and her 	eyes are fluttering -- a very serious wound.					SISKO				(hits combadge) 			Sisko to Bashir -- medical 			emergency.	Dax grabs his hand and Sisko holds on tight.					O'BRIEN			Helm control's gone, sir.10A  EXT. SPACE - THE JEM'HADAR SHIP (OPTICAL) 	Without a pilot, the ship PLUNGES into the Dark Matter 	Nebula in an uncontrolled, wild flight.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - TEASER     4A.10A  CONTINUED:	The two pursuing FIGHTERS do not follow our ship into 	the nebula -- they break off just before reaching the 	edge, and turn back.10B  INT. JEM'HADAR CONTROL ROOM	BASHIR has just arrived and is bending down over Dax, 	while Sisko keeps holding her hand. Bashir rips open 	the medkit and gives her a hypospray for the pain.					SISKO				(to Dax) 			Don't you dare leave me now, old 			man. Not here, not like this.	Dax relaxes slightly as the drug kicks in, but she's 	still hovering on the edge of unconsciousness.					BASHIR				(off tricorder) 			Puncture of the left abdominal 			cavity...				(grim)			... and it looks like the symbiont 			may have been injured.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - TEASER      5.10B  CONTINUED: 	Sisko reacts -- that's really bad news. Bashir is 	pulling out instruments and working on Dax, but before 	Sisko even has a chance to absorb this information -- 	the ship is suddenly ROCKED HARD. The lights FLICKER 	and some consoles are BLOWN OUT.					O'BRIEN				(off console) 			Sensors are gone... impulse 			engines off-line.	O'Brien looks with dismay at the few lights remaining 	on the engineering console.					O'BRIEN			In fact, everything's off-line...			emergency power is holding -- for			now.					SISKO			Garak, take a look outside --	Garak struggles to get his headset up and working.					GARAK			Just a moment...					SISKO				(to O'Brien) 	What happened?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - TEASER      6.10B  CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			I'm not sure... we might've been 			hit by some kind of gravitational 			spike in the --	Garak reacts to something he sees on the headset.					GARAK			Oh, no.					SISKO 			What is it?	Garak looks at him with a stricken expression.					GARAK			Hang on.11   EXT. SPACE - CLOSE ON THE JEM'HADAR SHIP (OPTICAL)	The Jem'Hadar ship is filling the frame at first, but 	then it FALLS AWAY FROM CAMERA, and as it does, we can 	see that it is plummeting straight DOWN toward a Class-	M PLANET covered with oceans.

His name is THIRD REMATA'KLAN. 	Just another genetically engineered soldier of the 	Dominion. But Remata'Klan has a problem. He's staring 	off at something o.c. and there's something in his 	eyes that we're not used to seeing in the expression of 	a Jem'Hadar. Worry.	MOVE TO REVEAL:13   EXT. ALIEN SHORELINE ONE - DAY (MATTE) 	Remata'Klan is standing on a rocky stretch of shoreline 	on an alien world, looking out to sea. Behind 	Remata'Klan are forbidding cliffs topped by scrubby 	vegetation, and there's no sign of any civilization on 	this planet. It's a desolate, harsh world. Another 	Jem'Hadar, FOURTH LIMARA'SON approaches him and stops 	a few feet away.					LIMARA'SON 			We have established a defense 			perimeter around the entrance to 			the cavern. I have sent out two 			patrols to reconnoiter the 			shoreline in both directions.	Remata'Klan takes that in, but says nothing and 	continues to look out at the crashing surf. Limara'Son 	waits a moment, then continues his report.					LIMARA'SON 				(continuing) 			The Vorta's condition has 			worsened. He will die soon.	Limara'Son doesn't seem particularly bothered by that 	idea. Remata'Klan's feelings on the matter are opaque.					REMATA'KLAN 			What about the First and the 			Second?  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE 7A-7C.    13   CONTINUED:					LIMARA'SON			I vaporized their bodies myself, 			and redistributed their equipment 			to the rest of the men.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE      8.13   CONTINUED:	(2)	Remata'Klan nods thoughtfully.					LIMARA'SON 				(continuing) 			You are now the First.					REMATA'KLAN 			No. I questioned the Vorta's 			orders. He will not forget that. 			As long as he lives, I will remain 			Third.					LIMARA'SON 			You were right to question him! 			If he hadn't ordered us into the 			nebula two days ago we would not 			have crashed on--					REMATA'KLAN 				(harsh) 			It was not my place. Remember: 			"Obedience Brings Victory."					LIMARA'SON 				(chastened) 			"And Victory is Life."	Limara'Son is suitably humbled by the reminder. 	Remata'Klan looks back out to sea.					REMATA'KLAN 			Until we re-establish 			communications, we will hold this 			world for the Dominion.					LIMARA'SON 			And if we cannot re-establish 			communications?	Remata'Klan gives him a very direct look.					REMATA'KLAN 			Then we will hold this world for 			the Dominion until we die.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE      9.13   CONTINUED:	(3) 	The two men look at each other for a moment, then 	Limara'Son straightens up into a position of attention 	before turning and heading off. Remata'Klan turns back 	to the ocean.									CUT TO:13C   EXT. ALIEN SHORELINE TWO - WIDE - DAY (MATTE)	(FORMERLY SCENE A12)	We're looking at another shoreline on the same alien	world. There's a bay here where the ocean laps up	against towering rocky cliffs. Far below us, we can	see the Jem'Hadar ship half-submerged out in the bay	and a tiny RAFT making its way towards the beach. The	Jem'Hadar ship is SINKING and we see one or two	EXPLOSIONS before it slips beneath the waves.14   ON NOG (FORMERLY SCENE B12)	As he staggers out of the ocean, and collapses onto the	sand, panting heavily. A shadow falls over him and he	looks up...15   NOG'S POV (FORMERLY SCENE C12) 	The dazzling sun is obscuring the figure towering over 	Nog. Is it a Jem'Hadar? But then the figure moves and 	blocks the sun behind him. It's Garak, bending down to 	offer the waterlogged Ferengi a hand.					GARAK 			This is no time to lie down on the 			job, cadet.	Nog is too exhausted to make a reply and it's all he 	can do to raise his arm and let Garak pull him to his 	feet. Garak's clothes and face are still glistening 	with water from his own time in the sea as he guides 	Nog higher up the beach. ENSIGN PAUL GORDON -- an 	engineer -- is on his hands and knees, coughing up 	seawater and struggling not to pass out.					SISKO'S VOICE			Ready... HEAVE! Ready... HEAVE!16   NEW ANGLE (MATTE) (FORMERLY SCENE D12)	Revealing a MAKESHIFT RAFT being hauled up onto the 	beach by Sisko, O'Brien, Bashir and LIEUTENANT LISA 	NEELEY (a Security officer).     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE     10.16   CONTINUED:	The raft itself was evidently cobbled together from 	equipment, barrels, conduit, cabling, etc. scrounged 	from the Jem'Hadar ship.	There are some pieces of Dominion & Federation 	equipment (phasers, tricorders, blankets, etc.) 	strapped to the raft, but most of the space is taken up 	with the unconscious form of Dax, who has been tied to 	the raft and covered with some kind of blanket.	Sisko and the others are wet, miserable and very, very 	tired as they pull the heavy raft out of the hip-deep 	water and onto the sand.					SISKO			Ready... HEAVE! One more! Ready			HEAVE!	The raft finally comes to a stop on the sand. O'Brien, 	Neeley, and Sisko all collapse for a moment on the 	sides of the raft, their eyes closing and nearly 	fainting from the exertion. Bashir is not nearly as 	exhausted as the others and he quickly grabs a 	tricorder from the raft and scans Dax.					SISKO				(panting)			How... how is she?					BASHIR				(off tricorder)			Stable for now.				(to Garak)			Garak! I need a hand!	Garak quickly moves to the raft and helps Bashir lift 	Dax out of the boat. Sisko and the others watch as 	they carry her up the beach, too tired to move for now. 	O'Brien suddenly realizes something.					O'BRIEN			Bloody hell!					SISKO			What?					O'BRIEN			I can't believe it!					SISKO			What?					O'BRIEN			I tore my pants.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE     11.16   CONTINUED:	(2)	O'Brien is glaring at a pant leg that's been ripped 	right up the side. Sisko looks at him for a moment... 	then laughter starts to play at the corners of his 	mouth.					SISKO			You tore your pants?	O'Brien sees the look on Sisko's face and he starts to 	lose it as well.					O'BRIEN			That's right.				(beat)			I guess I'm really in trouble now.	They finally start laughing like this is the funniest 	thing in the world -- it's a moment of exceedingly dark 	humor born of desperation and exhaustion. The two men 	fall back on the beach laughing and crying.17   WIDER (MATTE)	Showing the small shipwrecked party of Starfleet 	officers on the desolate beach. OFF this image...18   EXT.

KIRA'S QUARTERS	KIRA is asleep in bed.					COMPUTER VOICE			The time is zero five hundred			hours.	Kira is up and out of bed almost before the computer 	voice finishes. She stretches for a beat, faces 	herself in the mirror and then manages a very forced 	smile for the mirror.									CUT TO:     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE     12.20   INT. CORRIDOR/TURBOLIFT	Kira is waiting outside a turbolift, carrying a PADD. 	The doors finally OPEN and she ENTERS a lift that is 	already filled with N.D. Jem'Hadar and N.D. 	Cardassians. Kira nods to them and they nod to her -- 	they all know each other. The doors CLOSE.									CUT TO:21   INT. OPS	The turbolift ENTERS Ops and Kira steps out along with 	Jem'Hadar and Cardassians. Ops is fully manned with 	Cardassians, while armed Jem'Hadar soldiers are posted 	at strategic points. Kira moves off to one side and 	sits at a console while studying her PADD. The other 	Cardassians and Jem'Hadar move to different stations 	around Ops, and relieve their counterparts -- it's a 	shift change in Ops, but Kira takes little note of it.	A Cardassian N.D. hands her a cup of raktajino.					KIRA			Thanks, Mavek.	This is the new morning routine and it's just another 	day in the office for all of them. As Kira goes about 	her daily routine...									CUT TO:     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE     13.22   OMITTED 23   INT. JEM'HADAR CAVERN - DUSK 	This is a perpetually wet and unpleasant cavern that 	the Jem'Hadar are now using as a base camp. A few 	pieces of Dominion technology are in evidence. An N.D. 	Jem'Hadar is working on a Dominion communications 	system in one corner of the cavern, while Three N.D. 	Jem'Hadar Soldiers and Limara'Son are stripping and 	cleaning their weapons nearby. The Soldiers in the 	Cavern are jittery and seem to be having problems -- 	tools get dropped, fingers tremble, easily distracted, 	etc. (We'll shortly learn that all the Jem'Hadar are 	suffering from a lack of White, so there should not be 	any liquid flowing through the Jem'Hadar necktubes.)	In the center of the cavern is a small fire and 	makeshift bed, upon which is lying a badly wounded 	Vorta named KEEVAN. Remata'Klan is sitting on a 	container next to Keevan's bed and watching the 	sweating, miserable Vorta with no hint of compassion 	in his face.					KEEVAN 				(pained) 			This must be... quite gratifying 			for you. But I've decided not to 			give you the pleasure of watching 			me die in this foul-smelling 			cavern. I intend... to live.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE     14.23   CONTINUED:					REMATA'KLAN 			I understand.	Keevan looks up sharply -- was that a jab at him? But 	there is no hint of anything untoward in Remata'Klan's 	expression, only the mask of obedience.					KEEVAN 			How long until we re-establish 			communications?	Remata'Klan glances over at the Jem'Hadar working on 	the communications rig.					REMATA'KLAN 			Seventh Yak'Talon estimates it 			will take at least ten days before 			we can attempt a low-power test.					KEEVAN			Ten days...	Keevan closes his eyes, exhausted just by the thought.					REMATA'KLAN 			It is time for the White.	Keevan opens his eyes and motions acquiescence with his 	hand. Remata'Klan nods to an N.D. Jem'Hadar, who 	quickly brings the distinctive locked container of 	White over to the Vorta and sets it down on the cave 	floor. The case has been battered and scorched. All 	the Jem'Hadar start to move toward the White, eager for	the next dose of the drug.	Keevan works the security lock on the case. The top 	rises, but only Keevan can see inside the case. He 	looks into the case for a moment... sees something 	there that he knows is very bad news... but he cannot 	let any of the Jem'Hadar know. He proceeds with the 	ritual.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE     15.23   CONTINUED:	(2)					KEEVAN				(deliberate) 			Third Remata'Klan... can you vouch 			for the loyalty of your men?					REMATA'KLAN 			We pledge our loyalty to the 			Founders from now until death.					KEEVAN 			Then receive this reward from the 			Founders. May it keep you strong.	He hands Remata'Klan one vial of White and then shuts 	the case. The Jem'Hadar look stunned.					LIMARA'SON 			Only one?					REMATA'KLAN				(sharp)			Keep your place.	Keevan looks up at the tense and anxious faces of his 	men calmly.					KEEVAN 			This case of White must last until 			we're rescued -- at least ten 			days, possibly more. I will 			ration the supply. Don't worry -- 			I am the Vorta. I will take care 			of you all.	Remata'Klan nods and then leads everyone away from the 	Vorta's bed.

STARFLEET CAVERN - NIGHT (OPTICAL) 	The cavern that Sisko and his troops are using as their 	own base camp is drier than the cave housing the 	Jem'Hadar, but not by much. At one end of the cave, a 	low boulder has been HEATED by a phaser and is 	radiating more than enough heat to warm up the cavern. 	Sisko, Neeley, Garak, Nog, Gordon, and O'Brien are in 	various stages of undress and checking their 	waterlogged uniforms, which have been spread on top of 	the boulder to dry. STEAM is rising from several of 	the shirts and pants.	All the equipment from the life raft has been dragged in 	here as well and the cavern is lit from a few PALM 	BEACONS which are scattered around.	Neeley FIRES her phaser at the boulder, and it GLOWS 	hotter. Sisko picks up a hot vest from the drying 	clothing and gingerly puts it on over his already dry 	undershirt and pants. He checks his boots, but they're 	still too wet, forcing him to remain barefooted. Garak 	is holding up O'Brien's pants and inspecting the ripped 	leg with a professional eye.					GARAK 			Lucky for you, it ripped on the 			seam.					O'BRIEN			So you can fix it.					GARAK 			Unlucky for you, my sewing kit 			went down with the ship.					NEELEY				(not serious) 			Maybe someone could go get it --			the ship's only about five hundred 			meters below the surface by now.					O'BRIEN			Now there's an idea. cadet, how 			long can you hold your breath?	Everyone looks at Nog, who suddenly isn't sure if 	they're joking or not. They all smile at the look on 	his face.	Sisko picks up a pair of pants and a jacket and crosses 	the cavern to where Dax is lying on a blanket spread on 	the floor, across the cavern from the blazing heat of 	the boulder. She's naked underneath an emergency 	blanket that covers her body. Bashir is checking her 	over with a medical instrument, and we can see that 	she's awake.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rocks & Shoals" - REV. 8/15/97 - ACT ONE    16A.24   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Your jacket and pants are ready, 			Madame.
