ARGRATHI CELL	This is an alien security cell, with rough-hewn stone	walls and a smooth sandy floor. There are no beds or	other furniture, just a heavy metallic windowless door	of alien design. The light in the room is an odd blue-	white, colored to match an alien sun. There's a hole	dug in the ground in one corner of the room that	provides a crude toilet.	The room's only inhabitant is a male PRISONER in his	mid- to late-fifties, with an unkempt beard and a	tangled mass of white hair. We don't get a good look	at his face, but he seems familiar. He's dressed in	the ragged remains of a gold Starfleet uniform, but	it's barely recognizable from decades of wear and	neglect.	The Prisoner is squatting on the floor, drawing an	elaborate mandala in the sand. It's a beautiful	abstract pattern and he works on it with great care.	The Prisoner puts a finishing touch on the mandala as	if rushing to beat some kind of deadline. Just as he	finishes, a KLAXON SOUNDS, followed by an announcement	from a disembodied voice.					ARGRATHI COM VOICE			All offenders prepare for			decontamination. Decontamination			will proceed immediately.	The Prisoner braces himself.2    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	A wall of coherent light passes through the room,	sweeping everything inside, including the Prisoner and	his sand-drawings. As it passes over the Prisoner, he	doubles over, gritting his teeth and choking back a	moan of pain. The beam obviously causes him great	agony.	It also completely erases the mandala, smoothing the	sand as it progresses across the room.       DEEP SPACE NINE: - "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:	The Prisoner shakes off the effect of the beam with	some effort, taking a moment to catch his breath. The	sand floor is now completely smooth. With resigned	determination, the Prisoner begins drawing a new	mandala.	But he hasn't gotten far when the cell door opens with	the sound of sliding bolts and the flash of a	forcefield disengaging.	The Prisoner stands up and backs cautiously away from	the door, eyeing it with suspicion.3    ANGLE ON THE DOOR	As it opens, revealing a formidable-looking PRISON	GUARD backlit by a blinding blue light. The Guard	ENTERS the cell. He's an ARGRATHI, a humanoid alien of	a type we've never seen before. He carries a high-tech	looking baton and watches the Prisoner warily.	The Guard is followed by a second Argrathi, an older	woman dressed in a style that conveys authority. This	is K'PAR RINN, the chief administrator of this alien	prison.					RINN			Miles Edward O'Brien.4    NEW ANGLE	Close on the Prisoner, who we finally recognize for the	first time. It's CHIEF O'BRIEN, aged and worn from two	decades in prison.					RINN			The Argrathi Authority has been			conducting a review of your case.			Do you wish to add anything to the			official record?	O'Brien looks frightened and broken. All he can manage	is a shake of his head. Rinn allows herself the barest	trace of a smile.       DEEP SPACE NINE: - "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - TEASER        3.4    CONTINUED:					RINN			No matter.				(a beat)			Your correction is completed. You			are free.	O'Brien reacts with surprise and disbelief.					O'BRIEN			Free?					RINN			The crime of espionage requires a			minimum of fifteen cycles of			correction. You've been here for			twenty. It's time for you to go.	The older O'Brien makes no move to exit his cell. He	looks haunted, a shadow of the man he once was.					O'BRIEN			But I can't leave. Where would I			go?					RINN			That's not my concern.	Rinn gestures to the guard, who steps toward O'Brien.5    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	The guard shoves his baton into O'Brien's gut and it	discharges like a high-tech cattle prod. O'Brien	collapses to the ground.					RINN			Remove him.	The guard yanks O'Brien to his feet and shoves him out	the doorway and into the blue light, and suddenly we...									CUT TO:6    O'BRIEN'S FACE	As he opens his eyes and shouts in horror as if awaking	from a nightmare. O'Brien is now completely normal in	appearance, no longer twenty years older like the	O'Brien we've just seen. But all is not well. We...									PULL BACK TO REVEAL:       DEEP SPACE NINE: - "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - TEASER        4.7    NEW ANGLE	That we are still in the Argrathi cell, but this time	O'Brien is strapped into some kind of alien device that	looks vaguely like an electric chair. Wires run from	his temples and various other parts of his body to the	chair. An Argrathi Technician operates the chair while	Rinn and KIRA look on. A Guard (not the one we saw	before) restrains Kira.					RINN			There. It's done.	O'Brien looks up at Rinn and Kira in astonishment.					O'BRIEN			Major?					KIRA			It's me, Chief.	O'Brien is confused and disoriented. what he's seeing	doesn't make any sense.					O'BRIEN			But... it can't be. It's been			twenty years. You haven't changed			at all.	The Technician begins unstrapping O'Brien.					RINN			Only a few hours passed during			your correction.	O'Brien looks at Kira and at his own body, with his	intact uniform and younger man's hands.					O'BRIEN			I don't understand.	Kira knows O'Brien's disoriented and tries to help out.					KIRA			Chief, I know this is going to be			hard for you to accept, but... you			haven't been in prison. What you			experienced was an artificial			reality, an interactive program			that created memories of things			that never actually happened.	O'Brien reacts, not really understanding.					O'BRIEN			What?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - TEASER 4A-5.        7    CONTINUED:					RINN			The Major is correct.	Rinn could care less whether O'Brien adjusts to this	information or not. For her, it's a simple fact, a	technological approach to dealing with prisoners that	she's rather proud of.					RINN			We punish our offenders by giving			them memories of incarceration			modelled to fit each offender's			personality. It's more			efficient... and much more			effective than maintaining an			extensive prison system.8    CLOSE ON O'BRIEN	As he tries to absorb this. Kira can tell that he's	been shaken by his experiences and is having a lot of	trouble grasping what he's being told.					KIRA				(gently)			Which means everything you think			you experienced in prison,			everything you remember, didn't			happen. It wasn't real.	O'Brien looks up at Kira, a shattered, broken man. She	might as well be speaking another language. For him,	the time in prison was all too real.					O'BRIEN				(simply)			It was to me, major. It was to			me.	Hold on O'Brien's haunted look for a beat, then...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT ONE        6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)9    INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS	SISKO is breaking the news of what happened to O'Brien	to KEIKO. Keiko's a few months pregnant and is just	starting to show. She's trying not to overreact, but	Sisko's news is pretty grim.					SISKO			Apparently he got curious about			some Argrathi technology and asked			a few too many questions.			Argrathi security arrested him and			charged him with espionage.					KEIKO			Miles would never break a law			intentionally.					SISKO				(sympathetic)			I know that. But by the time the			Argrathi told us what'd happened,			they'd already carried out his			"correction."	Keiko shakes her head. The whole thing doesn't quite	seem real.					KEIKO			Can the memories they implanted be			removed?					SISKO			The Argrathi claim it's			impossible, but Doctor Bashir will			do his best.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT ONE        7.9    CONTINUED:	Keiko tries to be strong.					KEIKO				(nods)			When can I see him?					SISKO			As soon as Doctor Bashir gives his			okay.	Keiko nods. Sisko knows she'd like him to leave and	EXITS.10   CLOSE ON KEIKO	As she lets her guard down and shows how worried she	really is.11   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	The Runabout emerges from the wormhole.12   INT. RUNABOUT (OPTICAL) 	Kira is at the controls of the runabout, O'Brien is off	to one side. Kira brings the runabout around and Deep	Space Nine fills the viewscreen. O'Brien stands up and	looks at the station in amazement.					O'BRIEN			I used to dream about this. Being			on a runabout, coming through the			wormhole, seeing the station			again. I keep expecting to wake			up and find myself back in my			cell.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT ONE        8.12   CONTINUED:					KIRA			Being in your cell was the dream.			This is reality.	O'Brien nods, but he still can't quite believe this is	really happening.13   CLOSE ON O'BRIEN (OPTICAL) 	As he looks at the station for a long beat as it	revolves in front of him, obviously deeply moved. His	eyes mist up and he blinks away the tears. Not wanting	Kira to see him cry, he turns away.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT ONE        9.13   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			I forgot how beautiful it was.	Kira nods in agreement. She stands there quietly and	lets O'Brien absorb the view for a beat, then...					KIRA			Come on. Let's get you home.	O'Brien nods, never taking his eyes of the station.14   OMITTED15   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR	O'Brien and Kira ENTER the airlock corridor from the	runabout.16   CLOSE ON O'BRIEN	As he takes in the station, looking at it like a long-	lost friend. O'Brien runs his hand over the bulkhead,	as if checking to make sure it's real. Half of him	expects the whole place to vanish at any minute.					BASHIR (O.S.)			Chief?	O'Brien looks up and sees...17   NEW ANGLE 	BASHIR, standing at the end of the airlock, waiting for	him.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT ONE       10.17   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Julian?	O'Brien realizes it really is Bashir and embraces him.					O'BRIEN			It's really you.					BASHIR				(smiles)			It's me.	Kira looks from O'Brien to Bashir. She knows the chief	is in good hands.					KIRA			He's all yours.	She pats O'Brien on the arm, trying to give him one	last bit of support, then EXITS. O'Brien looks at	Bashir for a long beat, not quite believing this is all	real.					O'BRIEN			I never thought I'd see you again.					BASHIR			I was pretty worried about you,			too.	O'Brien looks around and sees that Bashir is alone.					O'BRIEN			Keiko?					BASHIR			She'll see you in a little while.			I want to run some tests first			thing... see what we're up			against.	O'Brien nods, almost relieved that he doesn't have to	interact with Keiko just yet.					BASHIR			As for everyone else... they send			their best. They'd be here now,			but I didn't want you to get			overwhelmed. You should take			things easy for a while... Let			yourself get used to the place			again.

Bashir looks at O'Brien.	Physically he's the same man who left the station only	a week or two earlier, but Bashir knows O'Brien's	experiences will have lasting psychological effects.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT ONE       12.17   CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR				(sympathetic)			I can't imagine what it must've			been like. Twenty years in that			cell.					O'BRIEN			It was bad.					BASHIR			In all that time, were you able to			talk to anyone? See anyone?	O'Brien shakes his head.

ARGRATHI CELL - FLASHBACK (OPTICAL)	O'Brien, still young and in a clean uniform, is flung	into the rough stone cell by an Argrathi Guard. He's	been starved, beaten and abused during his	interrogation and looks terrible.	O'Brien collapses to the floor as the cell door is	closed and sealed with a forcefield.19   CLOSE ON O'BRIEN 	As O'Brien lays there, semiconscious and in tremendous	pain, a hand reaches out and squeezes juice from an	alien-looking piece of fruit onto O'Brien's lips.	O'Brien reflexively drinks the juice and slowly comes	around. He looks up to find out where the juice is	coming from, and pries his eyes open to see...20   NEW ANGLE - O'BRIEN'S POV (OPTICAL)	Which is blurry and obscure at first but slowly comes	into focus. O'Brien is looking up at the face of an	Argrathi prisoner, about the same age as O'Brien, but	lean and grizzled from years of confinement. This is	EE'CHAR. He's been imprisoned for a long time, and	knows what O'Brien's going through.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT ONE       13.20   CONTINUED:	And despite being tough enough to survive in this	nightmarish setting, he still has a kind face and looks	down at O'Brien with sympathy.					EE'CHAR			Eat this.				(holds out the fruit)			It's chee'lash fruit.

PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	Keiko and Bashir walk and talk. Bashir's trying to	explain O'Brien's situation.					BASHIR			The bottom line is... there's not			much I can do. The Argrathi			didn't just install memory			implants. They ran O'Brien			through a time-compressed			simulation of the prison			experience. In his mind, he			actually lived those twenty years.			He reacted to what was happening,			felt pain, fear, hatred, made			choices and decisions that			affected the outcome. And as a			result, those memories are real.			The only way I could get rid of			them would be to wipe his entire			memory clean... and clearly that's			not an option.	Keiko tries to hide her disappointment, but it's not	easy.					KEIKO			I understand.	Bashir's just as disappointed as she is. But he tries	to put the best spin on O'Brien's situation.					BASHIR			Listen, Keiko, he's been through			some terrible things in his			life... during the war on Setlik			Three, as a prisoner of the			Paradans, during his trial on			Cardassia Prime. And he's always			survived.				(trying to convince them 				both)			In the long run, he's going to be			okay. It's just going to take			time.	Keiko nods. She believes in her husband.

He's battered and bruised, but in one piece. He	looks over at the food Ee'char had hidden.91   CLOSE ON THE FOOD	Which has been carefully divided into two separate and	exactly equal piles. There're a variety of different	types of food, and each has been cut meticulously in	half. Ee'char was trying to divide it equally so he	could share it with O'Brien.92   CLOSE ON O'BRIEN	As he realizes his mistake. He looks over at Ee'char,	who still hasn't gotten up from the ground.					O'BRIEN			You were saving it for both of us.	O'Brien goes over to Ee'char. But the Argrathi	prisoner lies still. O'Brien shakes him softly.					O'BRIEN			Ee'char?	But there's still no response. O'Brien shakes harder.					O'BRIEN				(urgent)			Ee'char, wake up. Ee'char!	But as O'Brien shakes his cellmate, the Argrathi's body	rolls over, his head dangling at an unnatural angle.	His neck is broken. O'Brien has killed him.	The only human contact he's had for twenty years is	gone.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT FIVE       60.92   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(in tears)			Ee'char.	O'Brien gathers the body up in his arms and holds him	close and suddenly, we're back in...93   INT. CARGO BAY	As before. O'Brien's got the phaser aimed at his	throat. Bashir looks at him, dumbfounded.					BASHIR			You killed him?	O'Brien looks over at Ee'char.					O'BRIEN				(a confession to				Ee'char)			And the worst part of it was...			the next day, the guards started			feeding me again. I'd killed him			for nothing... for a scrap of			bread that he was going to share			with me anyway.					BASHIR			It was a mistake. You didn't mean			to do it.					O'BRIEN			No. I meant it. I wanted him to			die.94   CLOSE ON O'BRIEN	who's in anguish.					O'BRIEN			I keep telling myself it doesn't			matter. That it wasn't real. But			that's a lie. If it'd been			real... If it'd been you instead			of Ee'char... it wouldn't have			made any difference. He was my			best friend. And I murdered him.				(a beat)			When we were growing up, they used			to tell us that humanity had			evolved.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT-FIVE       61.94   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)			That mankind had outgrown hate and			rage. But when it came down to			it, when I had the chance to prove			that no matter what anyone did to			me, I was still an evolved human			being, I failed. I paid back			kindness with blood. I was no			better than an animal.	This is the core of self-doubt and self-hatred that's	driving O'Brien to suicide and Bashir knows it.					BASHIR			No. An animal would've killed			Ee'char and never had a second			thought, never shed a tear. But			not you. You hate yourself for			it. Hate yourself so much you			think you deserve to die. And			that's what makes you human.				(steps closer)			The Argrathi did everything they			could to strip away your humanity.			And in the end, for one brief			moment, they succeeded. But you			shouldn't let that one moment			define your entire life. Because			if you do, if you pull that			trigger, the Argrathi will have			won. They'll have destroyed a			good man. And you can't let that			happen.	Bashir waits a beat for his words to sink in. O'Brien	finally relaxes and Bashir gently takes the phaser	away. As he surrenders the phaser, O'Brien looks up at	Ee'char.95   OMITTED       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 - ACT FIVE       62.96   OMITTED97   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Ee'char looks at O'Brien for a beat, then smiles. He	knows O'Brien's in good hands.					EE'CHAR			Be well, Miles.	And with that, Ee'char turns and walks away. As he	walks, he begins to fade from sight until he finally	disappears.98   CLOSE ON O'BRIEN	As he reacts to Ee'char's EXIT.									CUT TO:98A  EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE	Re-establishing.99   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR	O'Brien and Bashir are walking and talking. Bashir	hands O'Brien a hypospray.					BASHIR			Thirty milligrams twice a day.			Take it religiously for a month,			and if everything goes well, we'll			experiment with a lower dosage.					O'BRIEN			You sure this'll work?					BASHIR			It's a treatment, not a cure.			It'll prevent the hallucinations			and take the edge off the			depression. But that's all it'll			do. It won't take away the			memories... or the feelings.					O'BRIEN			You mean the guilt.					BASHIR			That'll take time.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hard Time" - REV. 2/05/96 ACT FIVE        63.99   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Now's the part where you tell me			I have to start seeing Counselor			Telnorri again.					BASHIR			Unless you want to talk to me.	O'Brien smiles. Not likely.					O'BRIEN			Telnorri will be fine.	They reach the door to O'Brien's quarters. O'Brien	knows he's got a long road ahead of him, but thanks to	Bashir and his family, he's taken the first step.					O'BRIEN			Thanks, Julian. For everything.	Bashir smiles, glad to see O'Brien is starting to heal.					BASHIR			What are friends for?	He EXITS as the door opens...100  INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS	Molly sees O'Brien at the door and goes running to her	father.					MOLLY			Daddy's home, Daddy's home.	She hugs O'Brien around the legs. It's an awkward hug,	but Molly doesn't feel that way. And after a beat	neither does O'Brien. He bends down, embraces Molly,	then looks up and sees Keiko standing back, smiling.					O'BRIEN				(to Keiko)			That's right, Daddy's home.	And off this tender moment, we...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
