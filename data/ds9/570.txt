AIRLOCK CORRIDOR	CAPTAIN SISKO, O'BRIEN and BASHIR are waiting by 	the airlock door, which OPENS to REVEAL WORF and 	EZRI, dressed as they were while held captive by the 	Dominion in "Eclipse." Sisko is all business, 	anxious to debrief his officers. But at the same	time, he can't help but smile in relief that his 	friends have returned safely. VARIOUS AD HOC 	greetings from all ("Ezri!" "Worf!" "Welcome 	back." "Good to see you!" etc.)					O'BRIEN 			I just want to say, I never 			doubted for a second that you'd 			be back.					BASHIR 			Neither did I.					O'BRIEN				(to Ezri and Worf,				re: Bashir)			Don't believe him. He was Mister			Doom and Gloom the entire time			you were away.					BASHIR 			Maybe I was a little concerned.	This makes both Ezri and Worf a little 	uncomfortable; neither one is prepared to deal with 	Julian's feelings.					O'BRIEN 			We were all concerned. Your well-			being was a constant source of 			conversation and speculation.					EZRI				(to Worf) 			You see, I told you they'd miss 			us. So who won the betting pool?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing... " - REV. 02/23/99 - TEASER    1A.1    CONTINUED:					BASHIR 			Morn. He guessed the exact day 			when you'd be back and only 			missed your arrival time by two 			hours.					O'BRIEN 			He's amazing.					BASHIR 			I don't know how he does it.	Ezri looks to Captain Sisko.					EZRI 			I know what you're going to say 			and the answer is yes, I left the 			station without your permission, 			and yes, I lost a runabout, but I 			did rescue Worf from the 			Dominion... well, maybe rescue 			isn't the right term... but I did 			find him...					SISKO				(cutting her off) 			We'll evaluate your actions 			later, old man. Right now --	Sisko leads the group down the corridor.					SISKO			-- I want you to tell me 			everything you've learned about 			this Dominion-Breen Alliance.					WORF 			I'm afraid we have very little 			information to share, captain.					EZRI 			Weyoun and the others were more 			interested in asking questions 			than answering them.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

Why do you 			think he helped you escape?					EZRI 			I'm not sure, but I'll tell you 			one thing -- he hates Weyoun.					WORF 			The Cardassians are a proud 			people. But the Dominion treats 			them as second-class citizens.					EZRI 			I think Damar's worried that this 			new alliance with the Breen is 			going to weaken Cardassia's 			status with the Dominion even 			more. But whatever his reasons, 			we owe him our lives.					SISKO			Who knows, maybe someday you can 			return the favor.				(to Bashir, re: Ezri 				and Worf) 			I want you to run a complete 			medical workup on both of them.					BASHIR 			Yes, sir.				(to Ezri) 			I can't tell you how good it is 			to see you again.				(then to Worf) 			The both of you...	Worf looks curiously at Ezri, wondering how she's 	going to handle things. Ezri's not so sure herself. 	But before either one has a chance to respond --     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

Even my 			people never attempted that. 			We've learned one thing about the 			Breen today, captain. They're a 			race of warriors.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

A few 	feet away, DAMAR is at another monitor.					WEYOUN				(pointing at the				readout)			There. Do you see that? The			news from Earth keeps getting			better. The Federation casualty			reports are being revised upward			once again.	The Breen issues some STATIC in response.					WEYOUN 			Well put. The casualties are 			merely a bonus. What matters is 			that we've struck fear into the 			hearts of our enemy and left them 			feeling weak and vulnerable.				(very satisfied, to				Thot Gor)    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

It's a very			small price for such an important 			victory.				(rubbing his hands) 			Now, if you'll excuse me, I must 			make my report to the Founder.	And with that, Weyoun EXITS.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

It's not. And for that, 			they blame us.				(a warning) 			Now, if the war doesn't end soon, 			they'll shift the blame to you.	Breen STATIC.					DAMAR				(all innocent) 			Maybe so, but win or lose, I 			wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun 			if I were you.	And with that, Damar EXITS.

Have a seat.					RUSOT 			I'm not sure it's wise for me to 			stay. What if the Vorta decides 			to pay you a visit?					DAMAR			And what if he does? He'll find 			me in conference with one of my 			officers. There's nothing 			suspicious about that.	But Damar can see that Rusot is still tense. Rusot 	crosses over to the table and pours himself a glass 	of kanar.					RUSOT 			It doesn't seem right... all this 			plotting and secrecy. What are 			we? Romulans?	Rusot hold up the bottle, but Damar refuses with a 	shake of his head.					DAMAR 			No, we're Cardassians. But right 			now, Cardassia is an occupied 			territory. And to defeat an 			occupying army takes careful 			planning and secrecy.					RUSOT 			Can we really hope to defeat the 			Dominion? With the Breen on 			their side, they're stronger than 			ever.	Damar steps over to Rusot and gently puts his arm on 	his shoulder, reassuringly.					DAMAR 			But we'll be fighting to win back 			our homes and our freedom. That 			will make us even stronger.	Damar and Rusot stare at each other for a moment; 	Damar practically willing his confidence onto Rusot. 	After a beat, Rusot nods.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

On 	one hand, he knows that in the greater scheme of 	things, a ruined pan is nothing to get upset 	about... nonetheless, he's not a happy man. And his 	mood sours further as a burnt, blackened mess in one 	of the pans catches his eye --					SISKO			My peppers?	Sisko picks up the remnants of a fresh pepper from 	out of the pan.					KASIDY 			I know how much you like roasted 			peppers in your casserole.					SISKO				(he can't believe it) 			It took me three months to grow 			them.	But Sisko is actually more bewildered than angry.					SISKO				(still can't believe 				it) 			No one touches my peppers.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

The wooden palisade 			on the south wall...	WIDEN to reveal --16A  BASHIR AND O'BRIEN	hunkered over the model, studying it carefully.					BASHIR 			If we could make that part of the 			compound less vulnerable...					O'BRIEN 			What are you talking about, 			Julian? It wasn't the south wall 			that was a problem. 				(pointing) 			They came over the north wall. 			By Travis's position.					BASHIR 			I know where they came over, 			Miles -- I'm Travis, remember? I 			say we strengthen the south wall, 			the north wall, and anything else 			that'll help keep the enemy out.					O'BRIEN 			But if we do that, it wouldn't be 			the battle of the Alamo, now 			would it?					BASHIR 			I don't care. I just want to win 			-- just once.					O'BRIEN 			Then be Santa Anna. He wins 			every time.	Bashir ignores the suggestion.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

O'Brien immediately 	snatches up the glass and sets it on another table.					O'BRIEN 			What are you doing? Do you know 			how long it took me to build this 			thing?					QUARK 			I don't believe the two of you. 			Your homeworld has been attacked. 			The Breen have joined forces with 			the Dominion. And you sit there 			calmly playing games.					BASHIR 			Haven't you ever heard of grace 			under pressure?					QUARK 			But shouldn't you be doing 			something more productive?					O'BRIEN 			I just spent fourteen hours 			recalibrating the station's weapons 			array.					BASHIR 			And I just finished a complete 			run-through of the emergency 			support team protocols.	But this only serves to confirm Quark's worst fears.					QUARK 			Then you do expect an attack on 			the station?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

Around the Alamo?					BASHIR				(pointing) 			All we have to do is widen that 			stream -- maybe make it a little 			deeper.					QUARK 			I say we build a moat around the 			station. Tell me the truth, do 			you think this place can 			withstand an attack by the Breen?					O'BRIEN				(thinking it over) 			Good question.					QUARK 			How about a good answer -- like 			"yes, we can withstand an attack 			by the Breen"?					O'BRIEN 			Quark... I could say that. But 			I'd be guessing.					QUARK 			Guessing?					BASHIR 			What he means is that there's a 			good chance we're going to lose 			the station, lose the war, and 			wind up dead in the process.					QUARK 			Then how can you sit there 			enjoying yourselves pretending 			nothing's wrong.					O'BRIEN				(shrugging) 			Grace under pressure. Haven't 			you been listening?	With a GRUNT of disgust, Quark walks off. Bashir 	and O'Brien continue looking at their model.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

No			matter how much planning they do,			they cannot successfully defend			that mission against an enemy			numbering in the thousands. Not			without more men.					EZRI 			If you want to go over there and 			help them...	Worf shoots her a glance.					EZRI 			Just a thought.	And off that moment --18   EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME - DAY (OPTICAL)	Establishing.19   INT. DOMINION HEADQUARTERS - DAY	Damar is staring at a monitor displaying Dominion 	security protocols. A jaunty Weyoun ENTERS.

How nice.	Weyoun steps over to look at what's on Damar's 	screen.					DAMAR 			I had no idea the Breen could 			mobilize such a large fleet so 			quickly.					WEYOUN 			Our new allies are full of 			surprises, aren't they? You know 			those refrigeration suits they wear... 					DAMAR			What about them?					WEYOUN 			I'm sure you've read the 			intelligence reports that say 			their homeworld is a frozen 			wasteland.				(off Damar's nod) 			Well, it's not true.				(sotto voce) 			The climate on their planet is 			quite comfortable.					DAMAR 			Then why do they wear 			refrigeration suits?					WEYOUN 			They won't say. You see what I 			mean? They're full of surprises.				(a beat) 			There's something different about 			you today, Damar... I can't quite 			put my finger on it.

And what does that 			light tell you? That the 			Dominion will prevail. That the 			Federation will be conquered and 			a new era of peace and prosperity 			will blanket the Alpha Quadrant.					DAMAR 			You know me so well.	Weyoun can't help notice the sarcasm in Damar's 	voice.					WEYOUN 			Really, Damar... I hope you won't 			allow that Cardassian-sized ego 			of yours to spoil our victory. 			And I do mean "our victory." 			Yours... mine...					DAMAR 			And the Breen.					WEYOUN 			Yes, and the Breen.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

As 			you requested...					WINN 			Very good.	Winn waits for him to place the book on the desk, 	but Solbor hesitates.					WINN			Well? Put it on my desk.					SOLBOR 			Eminence. May I speak frankly?					WINN 			If you must.					SOLBOR 			This book... it hasn't been 			removed from the archives -- not 			in seven hundred years.					WINN 			Your point being?					SOLBOR 			The knowledge it contains... 			about the Pah-wraiths... it's 			said to be very dangerous.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Changing...

That should make you feel 			better.					SOLBOR 			I wish it did.				(re: Dukat) 			But this man... he arrives one 			day on Deep Space Nine and the 			next, he's become your closest 			advisor. What do we know about 			him? Where does he come from? 			What does he want?					DUKAT 			I want only to serve the Kai.					SOLBOR				(to Winn, re: Dukat) 			This is his idea, isn't it?

He sets down the book and bows slightly, 	then turns to leave.					WINN 			Solbor --	Solbor turns to face his Kai.					WINN				(an order) 			The key.	Solbor takes out the key and hands it to Winn.
