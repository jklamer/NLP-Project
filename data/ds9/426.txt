Chief 							O'BRIEN			and I have been working 			overtime to prepare for the arrival 			of a new cartographer.  Ensign Melora 			Pazlar is the first Elaysian to join 			Starfleet and, as such, requires 			special accommodations.2    INT. INFIRMARY	Close on a wheelchair.					DAX (O.S.)			I haven't seen one of these in three 			hundred years.	Moving to back to reveal DAX and BASHIR... Bashir can be 	testing the gears or something... he's quite enthusiastic 	about all this work he's been asked to do.					DAX				(continuing)			I'm surprised it was even on file in 			the replicator's data bank.					BASHIR			It wasn't.  Ensign Pazlar sent me 			the specifications.					DAX			She actually uses one like this?					BASHIR			Her normal anti-grav unit isn't going 			to work here... same problem we had 			with the Starfleet cargo lifts... 			Cardassian construction just isn't 			compatible.            DEEP SPACE: "Melora" - REV. 08/27/93 - TEASER            2.2    CONTINUED:				KIRA'S COM VOICE			Ops to Bashir.  The Yellowstone 			has just docked at airlock 			fourteen, Doctor.	Exiting, pushing the chair out...					BASHIR			On our way.3    INT. PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS					BASHIR			Think of what she's gone through to 			get here, Jadzia... what it must be 			like to adjust to our gravity after 			growing up on a planet with low 			surface gravity.	They run into O'BRIEN, who is coming to find them... 					O'BRIEN 			Doctor... !	Continuing to move with them...					O'BRIEN			We've done the best we can with 			the ramps... the Cardassians 			obviously didn't have her in mind 			when they built the place...					BASHIR				(pleased with himself)			I've managed to modify the maximum 			vertical clearance of the chair three 			centimeters to a slope of fifty-six 			degrees.					O'BRIEN			That still leaves a lot of places 			around here she won't have access 			to...					DAX			Can't we just use the transporter to 			help her get around?					O'BRIEN			Makes sense to me, but she sent 			word that it wouldn't be acceptable 			to her.					DAX			I wonder why...            DEEP SPACE: "Melora" - REV. 08/27/93 - TEASER            3.3    CONTINUED:	Feeling like he already knows her...					BASHIR			I know exactly why... she went through 			the Academy the same way.  Once her 			basic needs were met, she refused 			any special attention.  She's 			extraordinary.					DAX			You make it sound like you've known 			her for years...					BASHIR			I almost feel that way... I've pulled 			all her personnel and medical files 			to get ready...				(remembering)			Her quarters... they're ready, aren't 			they?	O'Brien pulls out a small remote control device... hands it 	to Bashir...					O'BRIEN			I have the bumps on my head to prove it.					BASHIR			Thanks, Chief.	Moving away...					O'BRIEN			Let me know if there's anything 			else I can do.	To Dax --					BASHIR			That'll be something to see... when 			we turn off the gravity and she flies 			around her room...	Smiles at the excitement of it all as they enter the airlock 	corridor...4    INT. AIRLOCK - CLOSE ON MELORA	A cool, professional YOUNG WOMAN (MELORA) in her mid- to 	late-20's, standing at the doorway to her ship, she is 	wearing braces that are attached electronically to a series 	of blinkies on her hands and wrists.              DEEP SPACE: "Melora" - 08/26/93 - TEASER               4.4    CONTINUED:	(They are really only a suggestion of braces as we know 	them today... far simpler and "lightweight."  Conceivably, 	they may even be under her uniform, although, I'd kind of 	like to see something of them outside)  Plus she has an ornate 	wood carved cane which supports her body weight in one hand... 	although her face is a mask, the extraordinary pressure from 	gravity is apparent in every move she makes.					MELORA			Ensign Melora Pazlar reporting for 			duty.	Moving to find Bashir and Dax.					DAX			Welcome to DS Nine, Ensign.  I'm 			Chief Science Officer, Jadzia Dax... 			and this...					MELORA			Doctor Bashir... we spoke on 			subspace...					BASHIR			Good to meet you in person...					MELORA				(re: the chair)			I see you have my trolley car ready 			to go...					BASHIR			As requested.	Melora braces herself on the cane and presses some blinkies 	on her arm and we HEAR the device activate under her uniform, 	creating mechanical motion forward.  Instinctively, Dax moves 	forward to assist...					DAX			Here, let me help...	Bashir knows what Melora's reaction will be, reacts too late 	to stop Dax.  Without rancor --					MELORA				(overlapping)			I'm fine, thank you.	And Dax gets out of her way, as Melora moves with great strain 	and lowers herself into the chair...            DEEP SPACE: "Melora" - REV. 08/27/93 - TEASER            5.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					MELORA				(with relief)			That's better.	She puts the cane into a holder built into the chair... and 	will always have it with her.  She's instantly unhappy with 	the chair.					MELORA			You've modified it.					BASHIR			I wanted to give you as much mobility 			as I could.	She begins to roll forward, still frowning.					MELORA			I've been practicing on the model I 			requested for a month...					BASHIR				(embarrassed)			It's... really no problem... I can 			replicate the other design...					MELORA			No, I'll just have to adapt.	Bashir reacts, glances at Dax... as they EXIT...5    INT. CORRIDOR TO QUARTERS	Ramps are in place as needed throughout... and all of this 	conflict should be subtle and polite and underplayed...					MELORA			I really don't think that'll be 			necessary, Lieutenant... I'm perfectly 			capable of piloting a runabout...					DAX			Commander Sisko thought...					MELORA			I'm sure he thought what every officer 			I've served with has thought... that 			I need extra help to get the job 			done.  Please tell him, I don't.            DEEP SPACE: "Melora" - REV. 08/27/93 - TEASER            6.5    CONTINUED:					DAX			Commander Sisko wouldn't let any 			Ensign take a runabout into the 			Gamma Quadrant the day after she 			gets here...					MELORA			I'm sure the Chief Science Officer 			has more important things to do than 			to chart a sector in the Gamma 			Quadrant...	Bashir is increasingly uncomfortable with her attitudes...					BASHIR			Here we are...					MELORA			You haven't modified the 			specifications I gave you for my 			quarters, I hope...	The door opens.					BASHIR			Not one iota.  You can control the 			gravity unit with this device.  If 			you'd like to try it out...	He hands it to her.  She rolls inside.					MELORA			Thank you, I will.  It's been a 			pleasure meeting both of you.	And as she pulls back, the door slams in their face.  They 	never get to see her turn off the gravity... on their 	reaction...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                     DEEP SPACE: "Melora" - REV. 08/30/93 - ACT ONE            7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(Note:  Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)6    EXT.

During the following, she 	pulls herself with great strain out of her chair to her feet, 	uses the cane to brace herself as she executes the difficult 	climb up the stairs using the mechanical body device.  Her 	voice, though she does her very best to cover it, is full of 	the strain and fatigue like an athlete talking during a 	competition.           DEEP SPACE: "Melora" - REV. 08/30/93 - ACT ONE           11.11   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Not at all.					MELORA			It looked like the meeting had already 			begun.					SISKO			Dax and Bashir were just telling me 			about your request to pilot a runabout 			alone.					MELORA			Wouldn't it have been appropriate to 			include me in that conversation?					SISKO				(even)			I was getting a briefing by my senior 			officers, Ensign.  We talk about 			personnel matters all the time.					MELORA				(without sarcasm)			I'm sorry if I seem overly sensitive.  			But I'm used to being shut out of 			the "Melora" problem.  The truth is 			there is no "Melora" problem.  Until 			people create one.	They are now at the top of the stairs... and they go into 	the office and the doors close...12   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS	And she continues to be charming as she maintains her 	aggressiveness.  She moves to a chair and sits.					MELORA			This may sound ungrateful, because 			Doctor Bashir has been wonderfully 			helpful in the preparations for my 			arrival, but frankly, I wonder why a 			medical opinion is necessary in this 			discussion.           DEEP SPACE: "Melora" - REV. 08/27/93 - ACT ONE           12.12   CONTINUED:					DAX			Julian knows more about your 			capabilities than any of us.					MELORA			I don't need a medical opinion to 			tell me my own capabilities...					BASHIR			I also know the station and the 			runabouts...					MELORA			I've studied the station's 			schematics... and I've flown 			runabouts...	Sisko is studying all this...					SISKO			Ensign...					MELORA			I simply object to being treated 			like someone who is ill.					SISKO			I don't see anybody doing that.					MELORA				(still charming)			Try sitting in the chair, Commander.  			No one can understand until they sit 			in the chair.	They study each other for a long beat.  Melora smiles, backs 	off the intensity...					MELORA			I've been in one chair or another 			since I left my homeworld.  My family 			gave me this cane made from the wood 			of a garlanic tree.				(chuckles at the 				naivete)			... they had no idea what it would be 			like to live off-world... in what 			you consider "normal" gravity.
