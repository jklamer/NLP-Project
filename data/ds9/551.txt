PROMENADE	The mood is solemn. For the most part, we see 	MILITARY PERSONNEL -- Starfleet, Bajoran, Klingon. 	There's no window shopping or idle chatter; everyone 	on the Promenade seems to be passing through on 	their way to other business. That is, all but a 	group of TEN BAJORAN CIVILIANS (but no Vedeks or 	Monks) holding a vigil in front of the Bajoran 	Shrine. Deep in their meditation and prayers, they 	seem completely unaware of their surroundings. 	Besides their intense demeanor, all ten supplicants 	display scarlet-red bands tied around their upper 	right arms.2    NEW ANGLE - PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	KIRA stands at the railing staring down at the 	activity in front of the Shrine. She seems pensive, 	even melancholy.					ODO (O.S.) 			Colonel.	Kira turns to see ODO approaching; he comes to stand 	beside her.					KIRA				(smiling in spite of				herself)			Odo, I wish you'd stop doing			that.					ODO 			Doing what?					KIRA			Calling me by my rank. I was 			promoted two months ago. 			Besides, it sounds so... formal.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in... " - REV. 07/27/98 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:	Odo nods acknowledgement.					ODO 			Has Admiral Ross -- or should I 			say Bill -- arrived yet?					KIRA				(smiling) 			The admiral's ship is due to 			arrive in three hours. I wish I 			knew what he wants to see me 			about.					ODO			Maybe he's bringing good news. 			We could certainly use some.					KIRA			Don't get your hopes up. There 			was something in the tone of his 			voice...	Odo considers this for a moment.					ODO 			Something ominous?					KIRA			Something... pleasant. He was 			going out of his way to be 			nice...					ODO				(now he's worried)			I see...					KIRA 			Whatever he's coming to tell me, 			he knows I'm not going to like it.					ODO			How can you be so sure?					KIRA			It comes with the job.	Kira sees that Odo remains skeptical.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in... " - REV. 07/27/98 - TEASER      2A.2    CONTINUED: (2)					KIRA 			I'm serious. Sitting in the 			Captain's Chair, having that kind 			of responsibility... it focuses 			you...					ODO			I'll take your word for it.	Kira looks down at the supplicants in front of the 	Bajoran shrine.					KIRA				(with growing 				frustration) 			How many days have they been 			sitting there?					ODO 			Three.					KIRA			I can remember when the cult of 			the Pah-wraiths was considered a 			joke... now those red armbands 			are appearing all over Bajor. 			It's like everyone's gone crazy.					ODO			A lot of people feel abandoned by 			the Prophets...					KIRA			Believe me, I know how they feel. 			But that's no excuse to turn to 			hate and fear.					ODO			In times of trouble, some people 			find comfort in hate and fear.				(re: the 				supplicants)        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in... " - REV. 07/27/98 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO (Cont'd)			If you'd like, I can charge them			with loitering and have them			removed from the station.					KIRA			What good would that do?				(a beat)			I keep thinking... if the			Emissary were here, things might			be different.					ODO 			I would've thought we'd have 			heard from Captain Sisko by now.					KIRA			Not a word in three months.	Odo struggles to find a way to raise Kira's spirits.					ODO 			I realize things may seem bleak 			at the moment, but there's 			always hope...					KIRA			Since when did you become such 			an optimist?					ODO			Must have been that day, in 			front of Quark's, when we kissed 			for the first time.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in... " - REV. 07/27/98 - TEASER       4.2    CONTINUED: (4)	Kira smiles... Odo's managed to lighten her gloom. 	Kira pulls herself away from her contemplations and 	she and Odo begin walking away.					KIRA 			That was some kiss, wasn't it?					ODO			Changed my life.3    EXT. SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL) (STOCK)	Approaching Deep Space Nine.4    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE 	WORF, in the captain's chair, O'BRIEN and BASHIR at 	forward stations, NOG at helm. O'Brien breaks into 	a grin.					O'BRIEN 			Gentlemen, we are home.	Smiles all around, except from Worf.					BASHIR				(arching his back) 			There should be a law against 			convoy duty lasting more than 			ten days.					NOG 			I'll say one thing for guarding 			convoys -- it's usually a lot 			safer than being on the front 			lines.					WORF				(accusatory) 			Is that why you joined 			Starfleet, ensign? To be safe?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in... " - REV. 07/27/98 - TEASER       5.4    CONTINUED:					NOG				(flustered)			I didn't mean that the way it 			sounded, sir...					WORF 			In wartime, it's a soldier's 			duty to fight.					NOG 			Yes, sir.					WORF 			The invasion of Cardassia has 			ground to a halt while our 			casualties continue to mount. It 			is a time for warriors to do 			great deeds. To triumph in 			glorious battle -- not waste away 			protecting shipments of 			stembolts!	And with that, Worf gets up from his chair and 	EXITS. O'Brien and Bashir exchange a look, 	suspecting that there's more to Worf's mood than 	just the bitter pride of the frustrated warrior.5    ANGLE ON O'BRIEN AND BASHIR	as they get up from their consoles and stretch. A 	worried Nog approaches them.					NOG 			I hope Commander Worf doesn't 			think I'm afraid to fight.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in... " - REV. 07/27/98 - TEASER       6.5    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			Relax, Nog. Don't take it so 			personally -- Worf's just going 			through a hard time.					BASHIR			He needs to focus on something 			other than Jadzia. I hate to 			admit it, but combat duty just 			might do the trick.					O'BRIEN			The Defiant will be going into 			battle soon enough. Then Worf 			can be happy and the rest of us 			can be miserable.					NOG 			It's not that I'm afraid to 			fight... it's just that I don't 			want to die. 				(a beat) 			I wish Captain Sisko were here.					O'BRIEN			So do I, ensign. So do I.6    EXT. SPACE - EARTH (OPTICAL)	Establishing.7    INT. SISKO'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT	It's dinnertime and the restaurant is fairly crowded 	as JOSEPH SISKO seats a pair of customers. In the 	background, we HEAR a very soulful blues PIANO.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in...

Resting on the piano is Sisko's 	baseball.8    NEW ANGLE	Where JAKE is supposed to be waiting on tables, but 	instead is watching his father. Joseph approaches.					JOSEPH 			I think table five is ready to order.					JAKE				(re: Sisko) 			He's been at that piano since 			seven o'clock this morning.					JOSEPH			Customers seem to like it.					JAKE			Grandpa...					JOSEPH 			I'm worried too, but he's got 			something to work out... best we 			leave him alone.					JAKE 			We've left him alone for three 			months! He said he came here to 			figure out a way to contact the 			Prophets... to make things right. 			But so far he hasn't even left 			the restaurant.	And off their concern --       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in...

Sisko looks down to see where the 	ball has rolled --9A   SISKO'S POV	of the ball on the floor.9B   ANGLE ON SISKO	as the CAMERA PUSHES IN on Sisko's face.									CUT TO:10   EXT. DESERT - DAY (OPTICAL)	The ball lying in the sand. PULL BACK TO REVEAL	Sisko, wearing civilian clothes, digging desperately 	in the sand under a burning, hot sun. His face is 	haggard, parched; he's close to exhaustion.	At some point, Sisko tosses away the shovel he's 	been using and starts clawing away at the sand with 	his bare hands.11   SISKO'S POV OF THE SAND (OPTICAL)	as his fingers begin to uncover a face covered by a 	thin shroud. Sisko's hands remove the veil-like 	cloth to expose a face mask chiseled in stone. 	Almost immediately, the stone cracks into a thousand 	pieces which quickly turn into dust. Sisko brushes 	away the dust with his hand, revealing the face of a 	beautiful black woman. Her eyes are closed, her 	expression serene. Suddenly, her eyes pop open.12   CLOSE ON SISKO (OPTICAL)	confused and a touch frightened.					JAKE (O.S.)			Dad? What is it?

Across from her sits ADMIRAL ROSS.					ROSS 			Colonel, I really don't think 			you have anything to be 			concerned about. I've met 			Senator Cretak and I found her 			to be... very cooperative.16   ANGLE ON KIRA	having noticed the admiral's hesitation. Kira holds 	a PADD with a picture and bio of Senator Cretak.					KIRA 			For a Romulan.					ROSS			Cretak's a strong supporter of 			the Alliance... and we need that 			kind of support if we're going 			to win this war.					KIRA			I don't care if the Romulans 			were the only thing standing 			between us and total 			annihilation, I'd still think 			twice about letting them 			establish a military presence 			here on the station.					ROSS				(with some 				exasperation) 			We're just talking about a few 			offices for the senator and her 			staff.					KIRA 			And a contingent of personal 			guards.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in...

And 			right now, I feel like 			celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a 			debt of gratitude.					WEYOUN			Unfortunately, I agree.

SISKO'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT	It's after hours and the restaurant is closed. All 	the chairs are leaning into the tables -- all except 	one. Sisko is sitting there, intently working on a 	PADD.22   CLOSE ON THE PADD (OPTICAL)	we see that Sisko is trying to put together a 	composite picture of the woman he saw in his vision. 	Tapping a few keys on the PADD, he's able to change 	individual features of the face... nose, eyes, lips. 	And though it is slow and painstaking work, Sisko 	has made some progress.

I'm 			afraid your people took the 			brunt of the assault.					CRETAK				(stoic) 			What matters is that we held our 			position.				(a beat) 			As for our casualties... at 			least we now have the hospital 			complex on Derna to care for the 			wounded. And we have you to 			thank, colonel.					KIRA			All I did was put your request 			through to the Council of 			Ministers. They made the 			decision.					CRETAK 			Under your advisement, I'm sure. 			All of Romulus owes you a debt 			of gratitude.	Kira smiles uncomfortably. She's not accustomed to 	getting praise from a Romulan.					KIRA 			I'll keep that in mind.	The barest trace of a smile breaks across Cretak's 	lips; this is a formidable Bajoran.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in...

PROMENADE	Kira's headed down the Promenade when Odo joins her.					ODO			Do you have a moment?					KIRA 			I do for you.					ODO			This morning, a Starfleet 			transport filled with wounded 			was denied permission to dock at 			the Romulan hospital complex on 			Derna.					KIRA			The hospital may not be equipped 			to treat other species.					ODO			I thought the same thing... at 			first. But then I noticed that 			most of the wounded were Vulcans.	This is disturbing news to Kira.					ODO 			Vulcans and Romulans share a 			common physiology.	Kira is still trying to explain away the Romulans' 	actions.					KIRA 			And a mutual distrust of one 			another. That doesn't change 			just because they're allies 			against the Dominion.					ODO			True. But how do you explain 			these sensor readings?	Odo hands Kira a PADD.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in" - REV. 07/27/98 - ACT FOUR       44.56   CONTINUED:					KIRA			High concentrations of trilithium			isotopes...					ODO			Which would indicate the presence			of Romulan plasma torpedoes.					KIRA 				(troubled)			I'll look into it.	And off this --57   INT.

I was afraid you might be 			getting soft.	They circle each other, looking for an opening.					MARTOK 				(continuing) 			I need a first officer for a 			dangerous mission.					WORF 			How dangerous?					MARTOK 			Dangerous enough to assure Jadzia 			a place in Sto-vo-kor.	Worf looks over to Martok, surprised that the 	General knows of his concern for Jadzia. After a 	beat, Worf attacks Martok with renewed vigor and 	finally upends him, knocking him onto his back.					WORF			In that case, you have found your 			first officer.					MARTOK 			Excellent.	Worf reaches over and helps him up.					MARTOK			It will be a great victory.					WORF			I will make sure of it.60   EXT. SISKO'S RESTAURANT - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT	Sisko emerges from the restaurant carrying a heavy 	burlap sack containing another load of clams.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in...

But then I got to 			thinking that I'd take a couple 			of sacks on the runabout with me 			tomorrow... give me something to 			do on the way to Tyree.					JAKE 			You're kidding, right?	Sisko lets the doubt hang in the air for a beat.					SISKO 			Jake... if I never see another 			clam again, it'll be too soon.	Jake smiles and EXITS back into the restaurant. 	Sisko is about to sit down and begin work, when 	something catches his attention off screen --61   NEW ANGLE	to see a man standing in the alley, half hidden in 	the shadows.					SISKO 			Can I help you?	The man approaches cautiously, almost reverentially. 	As he steps into the light, we can see that he is a 	young, innocent-looking BAJORAN MALE wearing the 	simple robes of a penitent.					BAJORAN MAN 			Emissary... I've come a long way 			to see you.	The man continues to approach.					BAJORAN MAN 			This is a sacred moment... one 			that will be long remembered.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in...

The Orb 			that you're seeking... the Orb of 			the Emissary...	Sisko is amazed to hear someone else mention the Orb 	of the Emissary.					SISKO 			Yes?	The Bajoran man is within arm's distance from Sisko. 	Suddenly, from within his robe, the Bajoran man 	whips out a long blade and slices Sisko across the 	stomach. Sisko tumbles back, holding his arm across 	his midsection.					BAJORAN MAN 			You're never going to find it.	The Bajoran advances on Sisko to finish the job. 	He holds the knife before him, making a series of 	simple, ritualistic moves with the blade. Sisko 	backs away, holding his stomach, until he's up 	against the alley wall.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Image in...

Joseph is seating 	a group of four CUSTOMERS. Unlike the last time we 	saw him deal with his patrons, Joseph's usual 	bonhomie is missing. He's subdued, preoccupied.					JOSEPH 			Today's special is... shrimp 			creole.	Joseph starts to walk away, then, realizing he's 	made a mistake...					JOSEPH 				(continuing) 			Actually, it's barbecued shrimp.	But before Joseph can go on, the front door opens, 	allowing Sisko and Jake to ENTER.					JOSEPH 			Excuse me...65   CLOSER ON SISKO	Thanks to twenty-fourth century medicine, Sisko 	looks pretty good for a man who had his stomach 	sliced open less than twenty-four hours ago. Joseph 	hurries over to his side.					JOSEPH 			Where've you been? They told me 			you were released from the 			hospital two hours ago.					SISKO			I had to give a statement to 			Starfleet Security.	Joseph leads Sisko to a table.
