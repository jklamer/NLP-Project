QUARK'S - AFTER HOURS - CLOSE ON TONGO WHEEL	A slender hand tosses some strips of latinum into the 	central pot and gives it a spin.					DAX (O.S.)			I risk eight strips, with a			purchase at six and a sale of ten.	REVEAL DAX as she draws two oval cards from a deck and 	rolls a pair of dice. She looks up to discover the 	chair at the other end of the table is empty, her 	opponent's cards laid carelessly next to a small stack 	of latinum.2    THE BAR	QUARK frowns in front of his monitor screen. He 	evaluates the display, feverishly punches calculations 	into his PADD, inputs the result into the system.					DAX				(exasperated)			Quark, it's your move.					QUARK			Just a moment --3    THE COMPUTER DISPLAY (OPTICAL)	changes rapidly, an incomprehensible procession of 	alien stock quotes.					QUARK			Aaghhh! I can't believe it!					DAX			You beg me to play tongo, and then			you don't pay attention to the			game.					QUARK			I'll be right there.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - TEASER      2.3    CONTINUED:	But Quark stays glued to the monitor.					DAX			Let me put it another way... if 			you don't finish this hand, I'm 			calling it a night.					QUARK 			Okay, okay!	He rushes to the table, gives his cards a cursory 	glance, discards two and draws three.					QUARK			Who would have dreamed they'd 			strike feldomite on Parsion Three? 			The entire Sepian Commodities 			Exchange is in chaos -- everyone 			selling, prices falling --	He tosses some latinum into the pot, spins the wheel.					QUARK			Evade!	He dashes back to the monitor. Dax looks at her cards.					DAX			Are you sure?					QUARK 			You heard me, evade!					DAX				(shrugs) 			Okay.	She draws a card, smiles and lays her hand down.					DAX			Confront.	Quark stands frozen, staring at the monitor.					DAX 			You owe me fifteen strips of 			latinum.	Quark shuffles back to the table like a sleepwalker. 	He picks up the three strips of latinum beside his 	cards, hands them to her.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - TEASER      3.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK 			Take it, that's all I've got left.				(idly spins the wheel,				watches it go)			My antimonium options, my			quadrotriticale futures, my			powdered newt supplements -- all			wiped out. That's it, I'm			finished.					DAX 			It can't be as bad as all that.	The wheel stops. Quark sinks into his chair.					QUARK 			It can. And it is. I'm up to my 			lobes in debt. I put the bar up 			as collateral to three different 			brokers. The loans are due in a 			week and if I don't come up with 			the latinum there'll be nothing 			left of me but a greasy spot on 			the Promenade.	A WAITER approaches Quark with a worried expression. 	The waiter whispers in Quark's ear. Quark stiffens.					QUARK 			Here?	The waiter nods.					QUARK 			Now?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - TEASER      4.3    CONTINUED:	(3)	Another nod.					QUARK 			Tell him I'm out.	The waiter turns back toward the bar, halts 	indecisively when he sees that the fierce little 	Ferengi, GAILA, has ENTERED the room and is slowly 	advancing behind Quark.					GAILA 			If that's the best lie you can 			come up with, no wonder you're 			broke.	Quark jumps to his feet, and flashes an insincere grin.					QUARK 			Gaila! What a pleasant surprise.					GAILA 			I doubt it.				(staring at Dax) 			A clothed female. How 			titillating.					DAX				(to Quark, re: Gaila) 			Isn't this the cousin that tried 			to kill you?					GAILA 			I see you've heard of me. Now if 			you don't mind, I'd like to talk 			to my dear cousin. Alone.	Dax looks to Quark, who nods -- he'll be okay.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - TEASER      5.3    CONTINUED:	(4)	She turns, EXITS. An admiring Gaila watches her go. 	Quark wants to know what Gaila is doing on the station.					QUARK 			If you're here for your latinum, 			you've come a long way for nothing -			because that's all I can give you. 			Nothing.					GAILA 			Spare me the sad story. I'm well 			aware of your financial 			"situation."				(a smile)			And I'm here to help.					QUARK 			What are you going to do -- loan 			me some exploding latinum?					GAILA 			I can understand your 			skepticism... but I know a way to 			help both of us. I'm offering you 			a job.					QUARK			You'd defy the F.C.A. ban against 			doing business with me?					GAILA 			What's family for? Besides, I 			won't tell them if you don't.	Quark can't help being a little impressed by his 	cousin's offer. He's a drowning man with someone 	offering a helping hand. But he hasn't lost sight of 	the downside --					QUARK 			You want me to sell weapons, don't 			you?					GAILA				(smiling, open-handed)			It's what I do. Now I know you've			had reservations about entering			this lucrative field.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - TEASER      6.3    CONTINUED:	(5)					GAILA (Cont'd)				(dismissive) 			It's dangerous... it's too 			technical... it's not a "people" 			business... but let me tell you 			something, cousin, nothing could 			be further from the truth.					QUARK 			I told you before, I can't smuggle 			weapons through this station. Odo 			would be onto me in a second.					GAILA 			Who said anything about bringing 			weapons here?					QUARK				(suspicious) 			Then what do you need me for?					GAILA			I need you to do the things you're 			good at. Customer relations... 			showing our clients a good time... 			providing an atmosphere conducive 			to closing deals.					QUARK				(thinking it over) 			I can do that.					GAILA 			Of course you can. And you'll 			earn five percent of every sale.					QUARK 			Ten.	Gaila enters a few figures into a PADD. Holds it out.					GAILA				(smiles)			You'll take five.	Quark looks at it, sucks in his breath.					QUARK 			I had no idea.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - TEASER      7.3    CONTINUED:	(6)					GAILA 			Weapons is a growth industry. In 			a month, all your debts will be 			paid. In six months, the Ferengi 			Commerce Authority will be begging 			to reinstate you. In a year, 			you'll have your own moon.					QUARK				(loves the sound of it)			My own moon.					GAILA 			Success or failure? What's it 			going to be, cousin?					QUARK			What do I have to lose?	Gaila smiles. Quark smiles back.4    OMITTED									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as...

O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS - MORNING	Chief O'BRIEN is pacing up and down the room. His 	infant son, KIRAYOSHI, is cradled between his neck and 	shoulder. The DOOR CHIMES.					O'BRIEN 				(softly) 			Come in.	JAKE ENTERS.					JAKE 				(loudly) 			Morning, Chief!					O'BRIEN 			Quiet! You'll wake him. He just 			dropped off an hour ago.	Jake advances more cautiously, noticing O'Brien's red 	cracked eyes, matted hair and rumpled uniform.					JAKE 			You look terrible.					O'BRIEN 			Didn't get much sleep. He was up 			every hour or two. Every time I 			tried to put him back in his crib 			he started crying again. He 			misses his mother.					JAKE 			When will Professor O'Brien be 			back from Bajor?					O'BRIEN 			I don't know, a week, maybe two - 			however long it takes to get that 			blight under control.					JAKE 			That long?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - ACT ONE      9.6    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			And on top of that, Annel had some 			kind of family emergency. So I'm 			stuck without a babysitter.					JAKE 			Don't worry, Chief. Everything's 			going to be fine. I'll take care 			of Yoshi.					O'BRIEN				(a bit skeptical, but 				desperate) 			You sure you're up to it?					JAKE				(confident) 			Absolutely. I've babysat Ensign 			Pran's hatchlings a couple of 			times. Made sure their little 			wings didn't get tangled.					O'BRIEN			Kirayoshi doesn't have wings.					JAKE 			Even better.	Jake's confidence calms O'Brien.					O'BRIEN				(wants to believe it) 			Looks like he's worn himself out. 			He should sleep now. When he 			wakes up, give him one of his 			bottles. The diapers are in the 			bag over there.					JAKE 			Don't worry, Chief, I know the 			drill. Now go to work. You need 			the rest.					O'BRIEN 			I'll be fine. I went through the 			same thing with Molly. It's just 			a phase. He'll grow out of it 			sooner or later.	O'Brien hands off the baby to Jake -- like two 	demolition experts handling a live warhead.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as...

If			you need me, I'm only a com-line			away.	O'Brien turns to leave. He gets no further than the 	door before the baby starts HOWLING, stopping O'Brien 	in his tracks.					JAKE			He woke up.					O'BRIEN			Here, give him to me.	O'Brien retrieves the baby and bounces him in his arms. 	The baby stops crying.					JAKE				(impressed)			You're good.					O'BRIEN			He feels safe in my arms.	O'Brien thinks it over for a beat.					O'BRIEN			Hand me the bag. I'm taking him			with me.					JAKE			To work?					O'BRIEN			What choice do I have?	Jake helps O'Brien sling the baby bag over his 	shoulder.					JAKE				(to Yoshi)			What a great Daddy.	O'Brien YAWNS.     DEEP SPACE NINE- "Business as...

QUARK'S - AFTERNOON	The normal crowd. Quark and Gaila are standing by the 	bar waiting for someone. Quark seems a little tense: 	he keeps rapping the bar and bar stools with his fist 	as if testing for something.					GAILA			Would you stop doing that.					QUARK			Just being careful. Odo could be			anywhere or anything.					GAILA			Quark, we saw him walk down the			Promenade five minutes ago.					QUARK			He's very tricky.	Suddenly, Gaila stands straighter, adjusting his 	clothes.					GAILA			There he is.					QUARK				(thinking he means Odo)			Where?8    ANGLE ON THE DOOR	to see HAGATH, a tall, handsome and casually elegant 	alien. With him is TALURA, a statuesque and 	disquietingly beautiful female alien (a la the Boslic 	Captain). Hagath has an air of authority that he wears 	lightly; he's clearly one of nature's aristocrats and 	comfortable in his own skin.					GAILA				(to Hagath)			How good to see you again.					HAGATH			The pleasure is all mine.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - ACT ONE     12.8    CONTINUED:					GAILA 			Quark, this is my associate, 			Hagath.	Graciously, Hagath includes his female companion --	aware that Gaila wouldn't bother introducing a female.					HAGATH 			And my companion, Talura.	Talura smiles by way of introduction.					HAGATH 				(to Quark) 			Your cousin speaks very highly of 			you.					QUARK 			I've always said my cousin is an 			excellent judge of character.	Hagath likes Quark's self-assured attitude.					HAGATH 			I admire confidence in a man. In 			fact, I demand it of my salesmen. 			But in business, one must be 			careful not to grow too confident.					QUARK 				(agreeing) 			That can be a fatal mistake.	It's clear these two speak the same business language.					HAGATH 				(to Gaila) 			I believe the phrase you used to 			bring me here was "an opportunity 			of a lifetime."					GAILA 			An accurate description.					HAGATH 				(simply) 			Show me.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - ACT ONE     13.8    CONTINUED:	(2)	Hagath takes out a few slips of latinum which he hands 	to Talura.					HAGATH 			Amuse yourself. I'll be back 			shortly.	Quark and Gaila lead Hagath toward the stairs.9    INT. HOLOSUITE (OPTICAL)	The lights are dimmed except for a few bright 	spotlights illuminating an assortment of sophisticated 	weapons, each placed lovingly on its own pedestal. 	This holosuite has been turned into a weapons 	"showroom."	Hagath looks around at the weapons and how they're 	displayed. Gaila and Quark await his reaction 	expectantly.					HAGATH 				(softly) 			Very nice.	Hagath picks up a sleek, nasty-looking rifle, weighs 	its heft in his hands.					HAGATH 			The weight and balance appear 			right...	Gaila elbows Quark, who holds up a PADD.					QUARK 			There's a wide range of targets 			for you to choose from.					HAGATH 			That won't be necessary.	Hagath expertly charges up the weapon and aims it at 	Quark. Quark is startled, but before he can move out 	of the way -- Hagath fires at point blank range. The 	LOUD BLAST doesn't even singe Quark's clothes. For a 	moment, Quark and Gaila are too stunned to speak. 	Hagath breaks the silence with an amused CHUCKLE. 	Gaila follows suit and soon even Quark manages to LAUGH 	appreciatively.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - ACT ONE     14.9    CONTINUED:					HAGATH				(soaks in the afterglow) 			A perfect replica. It even pulls 			a little to the right, just like 			the real ones.	Quark smiles and smoothly takes it out of Hagath's 	hands, before he thinks of firing it again. Quark 	returns the weapon to its pedestal.					QUARK 			These are the finest holosuites in 			the sector.					HAGATH 			I believe it.				(to Gaila) 			Remember when we sold one hundred 			fifty thousand of these to the 			Manchovites?					GAILA				(grins) 			And we sold another one hundred 			thousand to the other side? Now 			that was a beautiful little war.					HAGATH 			Too bad about the armistice.					GAILA 			Well, all good things must come to 			an end.					QUARK 			You sell weapons to opposing 			sides?					HAGATH 			On occasion. But it's very 			dangerous. If either side 			realizes what you're doing, it 			could be very unpleasant.					GAILA 			But as they say... "The riskier 			the road, the greater the profit."					HAGATH 			True.				(surveying the 				Holosuite) 			I'm glad I came. This solves a 			lot of our problems.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as... " - REV. 1/30/97 - ACT ONE     15.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					GAILA 			It certainly does. No actual 			weapons coming in or out, so we 			don't break any local laws. All 			shipping happens outside 			Federation space, so Starfleet 			can't touch us. And since all 			we're demonstrating are holograms, 			we can even show off the specialty 			items.					HAGATH 			Well done, Gaila.					GAILA			It was all Quark's idea.	This surprises Quark, but he's not about to deny 	Gaila's compliment.					HAGATH 				(to Quark) 			You really are a find. I can tell 			we're going to accomplish great 			things together.					QUARK 			I can't wait.	Hagath puts his arm around Quark and draws him close. 	And though he speaks softly, Hagath's eyes bore into 	Quark.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Business as...

And why?					QUARK			Because they were overly 			confident?					HAGATH				(pleased with his pupil) 			Exactly. They underestimated the 			Bajoran thirst for freedom.

Good-bye.	Farrakk looks over to Gaila, who waves "bye-bye" to 	him. Farrakk sees that he has no friends in the room; 	he LEAVES, tail between his legs (metaphorically 	speaking, of course).					HAGATH			That was unpleasant.				(sitting down)			Now, what were we talking about?	Hagath smiles reassuringly at Quark, who smiles back. 	Quark's admiration of Hagath has just risen even 	higher.
