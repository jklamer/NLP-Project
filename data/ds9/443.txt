I was hoping to 			meditate for a few minutes...					BASHIR			Of course.				(beat)			I didn't know you meditate.					KIRA			Every day.	A beat as she recloses her eyes, gets relaxed.					BASHIR			I had the opportunity to study 			meditation with Isam Helewa when I 			was in college.             DEEP SPACE: "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - TEASER             2.2    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Remarkable fellow... he sort of took 			me under his wing...

Thirty quick breaths 			followed by one long intake of air 			through the nose and hold.

Slightly 			derivative of the Boldaric masters 			of the last century but pleasantly 			diverting.	Kira bites her tongue... Bashir leans back and enjoys the 	moment.					BASHIR			This is nice.

Doctor.					BASHIR			Julian.  Go on.  Say it.  Julian.					KIRA			Julian.					BASHIR			It was hard for Chief O'Brien to say 			too... we had a few problems 			ourselves, you know... now we're 			like this...	He sticks two fingers up together...					KIRA				(reading sensors)			One minute to the wormhole.  Stand 			by to drop to impulse.					BASHIR			Would you like to have dinner 			sometime...             DEEP SPACE: "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - TEASER             5.2    CONTINUED:	(4)					KIRA			I think you'd better stick with Dax...					BASHIR				(confused)			I'm sorry... ?				(beat, realizes)			Oh, you thought that I was trying 			to... no, no it wasn't meant to...					KIRA				(humiliated)			... my mistake.					BASHIR				(an additional thought)			... although, if I thought you'd 			be...					KIRA			... forget it...					BASHIR			...right.					KIRA			Take us out of warp.	Bashir reacts to some problem on the console, presses some 	panels...					KIRA			What's wrong?					BASHIR			The warp field's not fully 			collapsed... I'm showing a plasma 			injector leak...					KIRA				(checking)			The injector controllers are locked.  			I'm trying to compensate...3    EXT.

RUNABOUT - WITHIN WORMHOLE (OPTICAL)	A white optical flash sweeps across them.  They're being 	tossed around like a leaf in a storm, but Kira and Bashir 	stay in their seats.					BASHIR			What was that?	She has no idea...					KIRA			Initiating emergency stabilization 			control.	After a moment, the ride smooths out.  They look at each 	other.					BASHIR			Are you all right?             DEEP SPACE: "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - TEASER             6.4    CONTINUED:					KIRA			A little dizzy.					BASHIR			Me too.

PROMENADE (OPTICAL)	As they exit the airlock... and Kira reacts as they see a 	different Promenade... dominated by uniformed Bajorans, 	Klingons and Cardassians... there are humans and a few 	scattered Vulcans but there is no suggestion of Starfleet... 	these humans are mine workers and common laborers... dirty, 	pathetic victims of oppression... they have their own 	ghetto area of the Promenade like the Bajorans used to... 	although they move back and forth to airlocks and turbolifts 	as they do their work...					GARAK (O.S.)				(calling to Kira II)			Intendant...	She looks to the voice and we reveal GARAK coming, another 	Klingon deputy holding a wretched and frightened HUMAN MAN 	in his custody... Garak pauses as he blinks at the sight of 	the two Kiras... There is a tension between Kira II and 	Garak... they don't like each other...            DEEP SPACE: "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - ACT ONE            11.12   CONTINUED:	Bajorans and Cardassians do not get along even in this 	universe...					KIRA II				(impatient)			What is it you need, Garak...					GARAK			This Terran was caught trying to 			stow away on one of the freighters 			leaving the station...	Kira studies the man with regret...					KIRA II			What is your designation.					HUMAN			Zero-four-one-three-Theta.					KIRA II			Theta.					HUMAN			Yes, Ma'am.					KIRA II			You've worked so hard to earn your 			Theta designation and to earn our 			trust... why do you throw it away 			like this?	The human hangs his head in shame.					KIRA II				(to Garak)			Reassign him to Lambda.

ORE PROCESSING	A dark and dreary room... human laborers process the dirty 	ore... Worf escorts Bashir in... reacts as he approaches 	O'BRIEN, who is kneeling beside ODO, showing him a problem in 	the systems... two armed Bajoran Guards watch over the 	workers...					O'BRIEN			... if you don't upgrade the thorium 			containment cells (TECH), there's 			gonna be an accident and I'm not 			gonna be responsible for the 			consequences...					WORF			An extra worker for you...	Odo looks up...					WORF				(continuing)			A Terran who doesn't know the rules.					ODO				(rising, low key)			Well, we'll see to it that he learns 			them.	Nods to Worf, who EXITS.  At this point, Bashir knows he's 	Alice in Wonderland and he'll try to deal with it in the 	best humor possible.  O'Brien moves away, working with a 	tool to patch up some broken equipment.            DEEP SPACE: "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - ACT ONE           12A.13   CONTINUED:					ODO				("cordial" throughout)			What's your designation.            DEEP SPACE: "Crossover" - 03/08/94 - ACT ONE            13.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR				(with slight attitude)			Bashir.
