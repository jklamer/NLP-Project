SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.2    INT. GUEST QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	as an IDANIAN, an alien of a species we've never seen 	before, ENTERS from the bedroom.					IDANIAN			Computer...				(after the CHIRP) 			Time.					COMPUTER VOICE 			Eighteen twenty-one hours.	He crosses to the table and reaches into a SHOULDER BAG 	to pick out a small, pen-shaped WEAPON. He slips it 	into his sleeve and starts for the door. When it 	OPENS, two FINNEAN thugs, TRAIDY and SORM, are standing 	outside waiting for him.					IDANIAN 			Can I help you?					TRAIDY				(pushing him inside)			I think so.	Sorm punches the Idanian in the stomach, knocking the 	wind out of him and sending him crumpling to the floor. 	As soon as the door shuts behind them, Sorm pulls a 	small SCANNER from his pocket, starts sweeping the 	room.					TRAIDY				(to Idanian) 			Where is it?					IDANIAN				(struggling for breath) 			Where is what? I don't even know 			what you're looking for...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple... " - REV. 1/20/97 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					TRAIDY			Yes, you do.				(to Sorm)			Well?					SORM				(off scanner)			It's not here.					TRAIDY			That's not good.	Traidy looks down at the Idanian for a beat, turns to 	his colleague.					TRAIDY			Is it possible we've got the wrong			man?					SORM			It's starting to look that way.					TRAIDY			This is very embarrassing.	As the Idanian struggles to his feet, Traidy knees him 	viciously in the head, sending him sprawling. His 	attitude changes, he becomes all business -- cold.					TRAIDY			Listen to me. We know why you're 			here, we know who you came to 			meet, and we know what you were 			going to give her. So for the 			last time, where is it?	The Idanian shakes off the cobwebs... surreptitiously	slips his weapon from his sleeve...					IDANIAN			All right... I'll take you to it.					TRAIDY				(to Sorm)			See, it was him all along.	As he turns to the Finneans, the Idanian raises the 	weapon to take aim, but Sorm is faster -- he quickly 	pulls a small WEAPON and VAPORIZES the Idanian.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple... " - REV. 1/20/97 - TEASER        3.2    CONTINUED:					SORM				(looking at his weapon)			I thought it was on stun.					TRAIDY			Look what you did to the carpet.	Sorm looks down at the faint SINGE MARKS on the carpet --	a handprint and part of the Idanian's leg, where it was 	touching the ground.					SORM 			What do we do now? We don't have 			time to search the whole station.					TRAIDY			We wait for the woman. She might 			know where he hid it...	Off the two men as they stare down at the carpet...2A   INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL	ODO, O'BRIEN and DAX look expectantly at BASHIR as he 	joins them at a table.					ODO			You wanted to see us?	Bashir pulls out an ISOLINEAR ROD with a flourish and 	shows it to them.					DAX				(hopeful) 			Is that the new holosuite program?					BASHIR				(nods) 			The next chapter in the continuing 			adventures of Julian Bashir, 			Secret Agent. It came in this 			morning.					O'BRIEN			Finally. That friend of yours 			promised to send it two months 			ago.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple... " - REV. 1/20/97 - TEASER        4.2A   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			According to Felix, it's worth the 			wait. He said it's the most 			elaborate program he's ever 			designed.					DAX			What parts do we get to play?					BASHIR				(off PADD) 			You, Jadzia, will be Lady 			Wantsomore, a beautiful socialite 			who's been brainwashed to 			assassinate the Queen of England.					DAX				(delighted) 			Somebody stop me.					O'BRIEN			What about me?					BASHIR				(off PADD) 			Odo plays Nigel Dunlap, a former 			agent who comes out of retirement 			to help me foil this diabolical 			plot.					DAX				(to Odo) 			Perfect.					BASHIR			I play --					O'BRIEN 			We know who you play, Julian. 			What about me?					BASHIR 			You're Falcon, of course.					O'BRIEN 			Falcon? Again? I'm tired of 			being the bad guy.					DAX			But you're so good at it.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple... " - REV. 1/20/97 - TEASER        5.2A   CONTINUED:	(2)	O'Brien is about to protest but Bashir ignores him.					BASHIR 			So... is Saturday all right for 			everyone?					DAX			Fine.					O'BRIEN			No problem.					BASHIR 			Odo?	Part of Odo wants to, but he's not sure.					ODO			What do I have to do again?					DAX			Save the Queen.					BASHIR 			Not only that, you get to drive a 			fancy automobile, go to posh 			parties...				(showing Odo the PADD)			-- and steal her away from Falcon.2B   INSERT - THE PADD	Showing a picture of a beautiful woman.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple... " - REV. 1/20/97 - TEASER        6.2C   RESUME	as Odo reacts to the picture. If he wasn't sure about 	this before, he's sure now.					O'BRIEN			He steals my girl?					ODO			Maybe you should find another			Nigel Dunlap.					BASHIR			Are you kidding? Look at her.					ODO			I'm busy on Saturday.					DAX			We'll do it when you're not busy.					ODO			I don't think so.				(standing)			I'm sorry. I should never have			agreed to be a part of this in the			first place.	And with that, he moves away, starts down the stairs to 	the second level. The three would-be holosuiters 	exchange a look...					BASHIR			I guess we'll have to find someone			else to play Odo's part.					O'BRIEN				(studying the PADD)			I'll do it.	Bashir snatches the PADD from him... off this moment...3thru   OMITTED6           DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple...

He 	hears a woman's voice, firm and focused.					ARISSA (O.S.)			Look, I already told you --	Odo looks over to see a striking human woman, ARISSA, 	seated at the bar trying to get rid of QUARK.					ARISSA			I don't want to play dabo, I don't 			want a holosuite, and I don't want 			anything to eat.					QUARK 			Can I interest you in my 			collection of Risean tapestries?					ODO 			Why don't you leave her alone, 			Quark? Can't you see she's not 			interested?					QUARK 			How do I know she's not interested 			unless I ask?					ARISSA 			Maybe you should spend less time 			bothering your customers, and more 			time keeping an eye on your 			business.					QUARK				(suggestive) 			Don't worry, I can keep my eyes on 			more than one thing at a time.					ARISSA 			Really? What about him?	Quark follows her gaze to an Alien on the Upper Level --	he's surreptitiously working a RING on his finger, 	aiming it at the dabo wheel.					ARISSA 			He's got a graviton emitter hidden 			in his ring -- he's manipulating 			the table for his friend over 			there.	Quark follows her gaze to another Alien at the table, 	his accomplice. Just then, everyone at the table 	shouts "Dabo!" and the second Alien gets a few 	congratulatory slaps on the back for winning. Quark's 	face falls as he realizes she's right.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple... " - REV. 1/20/97 - TEASER       7A.7    CONTINUED:	He storms off to deal with the problem.	Odo glances to Arissa, impressed --					ODO			You're very observant.	Arissa looks past Odo toward the door -- the last thing 	she wants is another man trying to chat her up.					ARISSA				(cool)			Thanks.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple... " - REV. 1/20/97 - TEASER        8.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO 			Are you waiting for someone?	Arissa thinks he's giving her a line and decides to 	give one right back to him.					ARISSA 			You. Where have you been all my 			life?	Odo is completely taken off guard.					ODO 			Pardon me?					ARISSA 			Isn't that what you were hoping			I'd say?					ODO 			It's just... you keep glancing at 			the door.					ARISSA 			I'm waiting for someone.					ODO 			That's all I meant.	She realizes Odo is sincere and she's misjudged the 	situation.					ARISSA			Sorry. I thought you had other 			things on your mind.				(explaining) 			Must be those bedroom eyes of 			yours.					ODO 			Bedroom eyes... ?					ARISSA 				(sincere) 			You probably get that all the 			time.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple... " - REV. 1/20/97 - TEASER        9.7    CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO 			Not really.	A silent beat passes as she regards him. It's up to 	Odo to continue the conversation, but he can't think of 	what to say.					ODO 			If anyone bothers you again let me 			know. I'm Security Chief Odo. My 			office is just across the 			Promenade.	Arissa finds this sweet, but she can take care of 	herself.					ARISSA 			I'll be all right.	Another silent moment... Odo is awkward, he's never 	gotten such a curious compliment from a woman before 	and it's thrown him.					ODO 			Well. I have to go. To work. In 			my office.					ARISSA 				(smiling) 			Across the Promenade.					ODO 			Exactly.	And with that, he turns and EXITS... we HOLD on her for 	a beat as she watches him go. As soon as he's gone, 	it's like a dark cloud has descended over her. She 	puts up a good front, but the truth is she's seriously 	concerned about something.	We move to reveal...8    TRAIDY AND SORM	sitting at a nearby table. They're well within 	Arissa's line of sight, but it's clear she doesn't 	recognize them. Off their somber faces as they watch 	her...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple...

CARGO BAY	where Odo and KIRA are supervising the inspection of 	some cargo being brought to the station. 	SUPERNUMERARIES are checking over manifests and 	bringing in CRATES through the airlock.	Odo is surreptitiously trying to catch his own 	REFLECTION in a nearby surface when Kira approaches 	him. He immediately stops what he's doing.					KIRA			Look at this.	She holds up her hand and we see a series of small 	suction-cup MARKINGS on her skin, like what an octopus 	might make. She indicates a CRATE with Klingon 	markings on it.					KIRA			I went to check the contents of			that crate -- a tentacle grabbed 			hold of my hand.					ODO			Gagh. The Klingons have been 			getting regular shipments since 			the day they were posted here.					KIRA			I can't believe they eat that 			stuff.	She sees Odo cast a glance toward the reflective 	surface isn't sure what he's looking at.					KIRA 			What are you doing?					ODO 			Nothing.	She sees how embarrassed he seems, realizes he was 	looking at his reflection.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple...

Why?					KIRA 			She's obviously very perceptive.					ODO			Meaning what?					KIRA				(smiles) 			Meaning you should see her again.	And with that, Kira turns away, and moves to join an 	N.D.  Odo -- part pleased, part flustered -- turns to 	give his reflection another look.10   INT. PROMENADE	as Odo makes his way toward his office. 	SUPERNUMERARIES as needed. Odo pauses outside Quark's, 	glances over toward the door, and considers for a beat.11   INT. QUARK'S	as Odo ENTERS and takes a look around. SUPERNUMERARIES 	as needed. He scans the room for Arissa, but doesn't 	see her anywhere. Quark spots him --					QUARK 			She came in this morning as soon 			as I opened, stayed for about an 			hour and left.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple...

Why do you always fall 			for the same type?					ODO			What are you talking about?					QUARK 			The tough, no nonsense type -- 			like a certain Bajoran major?	Odo refuses to take the bait.

She musters a wry	smile...					ARISSA 			Hello, again.	The Deputy reacts to the fact that she seems to know 	Odo, glances at his boss. Odo covers his reaction, is 	all business.					ODO				(to Deputy)			What's this all about?	The Deputy hands him a PADD -- Odo glances at it, 	indicates that the Deputy can leave.					ODO			You tried to break into the 			station's computer. Why?					ARISSA			My friend never showed up last 			night. I wanted to check the 			passenger manifests to find out if 			he came aboard.					ODO			Why didn't you come to me? I 			could've checked the manifests for 			you.					ARISSA			When you grow up on Finnea Prime, 			you learn not to trust policemen.	She reaches up and touches something at the back of her 	neck, almost as if something there was giving her a 	mild but persistent pain.					ODO			Dataport bothering you?	Arissa pulls her hair aside...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "A Simple...

I couldn't stay 			interfaced long enough to break 			past the encryption lockouts.					ODO			That was the idea.				(beat)			Tell me...				(glances at PADD) 			Arissa, what's a nice woman like 			you doing with a dataport?					ARISSA			They're not illegal.					ODO 			They ought to be.

Nothing 	seems out of the ordinary.
