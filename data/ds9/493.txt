SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	as a BAJORAN TRANSPORT pulls up to the station; another 	VESSEL can be seen moving in the background.4    INT. PROMENADE	as PASSENGERS from the transport ENTER the Promenade 	from an airlock. The mix should represent a variety of 	Starfleet officers, Bajorans and aliens, and most of 	them seem to be here on business of some kind. We see 	Bajoran dignitaries being greeted by Bajoran officers 	in uniform, Vedeks being greeted by fellow Vedeks, etc.	JAKE SISKO is leaning against the rail on the Second 	Level, studying the faces and costumes of the departing 	passengers. He activates a PADD in his hand and we 	hear a distinctive BEEP.					JAKE			Character sketches for possible 			stories...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/22/96 - TEASER         3.4    CONTINUED:	Jake starts describing some of the passersby who catch 	his eye: a short, blue BOLIAN walks arm-and-arm with a 	leggy Bajoran DABO GIRL; he's wearing fancy clothes 	and, oddly, he has hair.					JAKE			A Bolian tries to impress a dabo 			girl... by wearing a toupee...	A Bajoran MONK ENTERS carrying a SATCHEL and is greeted 	by one of the FERENGI WAITERS that works at Quark's.					JAKE			A thief disguises himself as a			Monk so he can swindle a			Ferengi...	Jake's eye is caught by a striking Alien Woman who 	stands framed in the airlock, strangely still, taking 	in her surroundings with a gaze that is at once bemused 	and world-weary.	We will come to know her as ONAYA. Her features are 	vaguely feline, though you might have to look twice to 	see she wasn't human. Her skin is pale, her hair long 	and dark, like her dress, which is flowing and 	diaphanous. It's hard to guess her age, mid-thirties, 	maybe forties.					JAKE			A woman... traveling alone... 			she's come a long way...	Jake stops talking when he sees her eyes find his... 	she's looking at him. Their eyes lock...5    JAKE'S POV	as the woman holds his gaze... until some other 	passengers block Jake's sightline for a moment.6    RESUME SCENE	When Jake can see again, the woman is gone. He cranes 	to find her again, looks this way and that, but she's 	nowhere to be found.

It's first thing in the 	morning, and the shops are just opening for business. 	A BAJORAN SHOPKEEPER is arranging merchandise on the 	counter when she sees Odo. She smiles because he's 	coming through at his usual time, to the minute. He 	nods a greeting.					ODO			Good morning...	He passes another storefront where the ALIEN PROPRIETOR 	is just swinging his doors open.					ODO			Punctual, as always...	They exchange nods as Odo continues off...7B   NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 2)	as Odo passes by Quark's. He stops in his tracks, 	dismayed to see MORN and a few other would-be customers 	standing outside the locked door, waiting with TWO 	FERENGI WAITERS for the bar to open. Odo doesn't like 	this, Quark is late. Suddenly QUARK hurries up, 	looking a bit harried, like he's overslept. Morn 	starts to say something, but Quark cuts him off.					QUARK			Don't even start.	Morn falls silent, decides to be thankful Quark made 	it. Quark fiddles with the lock until he notices Odo standing there.					QUARK			What are you looking at?	Odo says nothing, just looks disapproving.					QUARK			So I'm a few minutes late. I was			here till four in the morning last			night.					ODO			You close at two.	The door starts to OPEN.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/22/96 TEASER         4A.7B   CONTINUED:					QUARK			You never know what time your last 			customer is going to leave. 				(pointed)			Right, Morn?	Morn skulks inside...					ODO						If this were my bar, I'd have it 			cleared out promptly at two A.M.					QUARK			If this were your bar, people 			would be so bored you'd be lucky 			to get them to stay past nine.					ODO			But I wouldn't keep them waiting 			in the morning...	And with that, Odo heads for his office...8    INT. SECURITY OFFICE	as Odo ENTERS and is surprised to find LWAXANA TROI 	sitting in front of his desk. She looks at him, tries 	to smile a greeting, though the truth is she's upset 	and emotional.					ODO			Ambassador Troi...	Tears start to well up in her eyes.					LWAXANA			Please... Lwaxana...	Odo doesn't know what to make of her apparent distress --	is she upset just because he called her Ambassador 	Troi?					ODO			I'm sorry... if that's what you 			prefer.	She nods, chokes back a sob.					ODO			Is there something wrong... why 			are you crying?					LWAXANA			Because...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/22/96 - TEASER         5.8    CONTINUED: 	She stands... and for the first time, we notice her mid-	section "is swollen with child.					LWAXANA			I'm pregnant...	Off Odo's uncertainty about how to react we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/20/96 - ACT ONE        6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)9    INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS	Odo swallows his surprise, unsure what Lwaxana's teary 	demeanor represents. She stifles a sob, tries to 	smile.					LWAXANA			It's a miracle. I never thought 			I'd be able to have another baby.					ODO			Then those are tears of 			happiness...	But this only sends Lwaxana over the edge; she starts 	to get agitated...					LWAXANA			I won't let him do it, Odo!					ODO				(concerned)			Who... what?					LWAXANA			My husband -- Jeyal -- he wants to			take my baby from me! That's why 			I ran away!	Odo tries to calm her, guides her back to the chair...					ODO			Lwaxana, please. Try to be calm. 			Now, why would your husband want 			to take your baby from you?	She takes a breath, steadies herself.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/20/96 ACT ONE         7.9    CONTINUED:					LWAXANA			He's Tavnian.	She looks at him as if this were explanation enough, 	but Odo has no idea what this means.					ODO			And?					LWAXANA			They believe in strict separation 			of the sexes. Boys are raised by 			men, girls by women. Those poor 			children aren't even told the 			other sex exists until they're 			sixteen.					ODO				(catching on)			And your child is male.					LWAXANA				(nods)			The day Jeyal found out, he said 			he was going to take the baby away 			from me as soon as he was born 			I told him that wasn't what we'd 			agreed to; he'd said it would be 			different with us because I wasn't 			Tavnian.					ODO			But he changed his mind.					LWAXANA				(nods)			During our wedding ceremony, he 			spoke so beautifully about why he 			wanted to marry me, but afterwards 			it was as if I'd become a piece of 			property in his eyes.					ODO			So you ran away.					LWAXANA			And it wasn't easy, believe me. 			Toward the end, I was practically 			a prisoner in my own house.	Odo knows Lwaxana came to him for a reason, and he's 	desperate to find a way to put the situation right and 	get her out of his hair.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/20/96 ACT ONE         8.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO			Now that you've shown your husband 			how determined you are to be part 			of your son's life, perhaps he'll 			reconsider his position.					LWAXANA			Not Jeyal. He's the most willful 			man I've ever met.	She lets out a deep, worried breath...					LWAXANA			I'm so tired, Odo. I've never 			needed a friend more than I do 			right now.	Odo isn't sure what she's asking of him, but he doubts 	he's going to like it. He starts to beg off...					ODO			I appreciate your situation, and			I would like to help...	Before Odo can continue...					LWAXANA			I knew you would. You're such a 			sweet, dear man.					ODO				(quickly)			Unfortunately, I'm also a very busy man.					LWAXANA			Of course. Believe me, the last 			thing I want is to be a burden to 			you. I know how much you value 			your privacy. All I want is a 			quiet place where I can have my 			baby in peace.	Odo sees a chance, grabs for it...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/20/96 - ACT ONE        9.9    CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO			I was about to suggest the very 			thing. I'll find out when the 			next transport leaves for Betazed.					LWAXANA			I couldn't possibly go there. 			That's the first place Jeyal will 			look for me. I know him. He 			won't give up until he finds me 			and gets his son back.	She turns to Odo, looks at him with the utter conviction 	that he'll do the right thing.					LWAXANA			That's why I came to you. Because 			I knew you'd protect me.	She looks at him with those big, dark eyes... the essence 	of vulnerability.					LWAXANA			You will protect me, won't you, 			Odo?	Odo doesn't want to encourage her to stay on the 	station, and so he keeps his response business-like.					ODO			I'm chief of security on this 			station. It's my duty to protect 			everyone aboard.					LWAXANA			I knew I could count on you.				(a beat)			Then it's settled, I'll have the 			baby here.	Odo's heart sinks... she's staying, and he's going to 	have to deal with her.					ODO				(giving up)			I'll see that you're assigned 			quarters.					LWAXANA			Near yours? I really would feel 			safer knowing you're close.					ODO			I'll see what I can do.	She moves to him, pulls him into a hug...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/22/96 - ACT ONE       10.9    CONTINUED:	(4)					LWAXANA			Thank you, Odo. You don't know 			what this means to me.					ODO				(more to himself)			No... but I know what it means 			to me...	She pulls back, looks at him questioningly, and he 	musters a reassuring smile... off Odo's features as he 	contemplates what he's in for...9A   EXT.

She watches him work for a beat, then 	finally speaks to him. Her voice is alluring, full of 	mystery...					ONAYA			You're a writer...	He looks up at the sound of her voice and his face 	brightens when he realizes it's her.					ONAYA			I could see it in your eyes... 			they were somewhere else.

I hope they do...	This time the subtext is clear: she's talking about 	Jake. It makes him a bit uncomfortable, so he steers 	back to the subject.					JAKE			I... I've always wondered what 			Kell would've designed if he'd 			lived to be older.					ONAYA				(with conviction)			He accomplished more in the years 			that he had than most people could 			in a dozen lifetimes.

Isn't that why 			you write?	No one has ever talked like this to Jake, taken his 	writing so seriously, and he's a bit embarrassed by it.					JAKE			I don't know... I think it's 			mostly because I like to tell 			stories.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/22/96 - ACT ONE       13.11   CONTINUED:	(3)					ONAYA			There's no reason to hide your 			ambition, Jake.

I'm thinking about going 			to the Pennington School, on 			Earth.					ONAYA			You already have the talent inside 			you. I can see it. You just need 			someone to help you bring it to 			the surface. 					JAKE			How?					ONAYA			There are ways.

This is a man who was 	raised by men, apart from "the corrupting influence of 	women." His bearing is almost military, his clothes 	have that pressed and tailored look, as if wrinkles 	were a sign of weakness. His hair is close-cropped and 	neat.	Jeyal is indignant at having been brought here, and he 	demands an explanation to the back of Odo's chair, his 	voice hard, even.					JEYAL			You'd better have a good reason 			for dragging me in here.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT THREE       34.30   CONTINUED:					ODO			I'm chief of station security. 			That's all the reason I need.	As he says this, Odo turns his chair around to face the 	door.

ODO'S QUARTERS	The jungle gym has been moved to one corner to make 	room for the wedding ceremony. O'BRIEN, BASHIR, Dax, 	Kira and Quark are present, all looking utterly 	perplexed by what's going on. Jeyal is standing 	nearby, his arms folded across his chest, looking 	skeptical about the whole proceeding. A few of Odo's 	DEPUTIES are also present.	A CEREMONIAL PEDESTAL has been positioned near the 	window. It's octagonal, about two feet high and three 	across, with painted alien symbols carved into its 	wooden surface.	Odo is wearing a Tavnian wedding TUNIC over his 	uniform, embroidered along the edges with the same sort 	of symbols seen on the pedestal. He's standing near 	the pedestal waiting for Lwaxana to come in, trying not 	to look uncomfortable about the whole situation.	Bashir leans in to Kira and O'Brien and whispers a 	question.					BASHIR			Did I miss something? I didn't			know Odo was getting married until			this morning.					KIRA				(sotto)			I'm not sure he knew either...	O'Brien leans toward them, nods toward Jeyal.					O'BRIEN				(sotto)			Who's that?					KIRA			I think he's Lwaxana's husband.					O'BRIEN				(wry)			Nice of him to come.	Quark, who looks particularly annoyed, leans in to Dax.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FOUR       39.35   CONTINUED:					QUARK				(sotto)			I don't believe it. How could Odo 			do this to me? It's so unfair.					DAX				(mischeivous)			Is there something going on 			between you and Odo I don't know 			about?					QUARK			Don't be ridiculous. All I'm 			saying is that I could've arranged 			a beautiful reception if he'd 			given me enough notice.					DAX				(smiling)			And enough latinum.					QUARK			If he thinks he's getting a 			wedding gift from me, he's got 			another thing coming...	Jeyal approaches Odo...					ODO			I'm so glad you could make it.					JEYAL			I'm sure you are. It's not too 			late to call it off.				(off Odo's look)			Your dignity is important to you. 			I understand that. I wouldn't 			want anyone to see me go through 			a charade like this.	Odo tries to muster up all the indignation he can.					ODO			If you don't mind... this is a 			very special moment for me...	Jeyal smiles skeptically. Odo, turns away, moves back 	to stand near the pedestal.	A moment later, Lwaxana ENTERS from the other room, 	wearing a Tavnian wedding gown. It's lush and flowing, 	and strikingly, the bride wears it barefoot. She's 	carrying a traditional Tavnian LIGHT BALL, and looks so 	lovely in its soft halo that all present fall silent.	Lwaxana smiles at Odo, crosses to the pedestal, and he 	offers his hand and helps her step up onto it.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FOUR       40.35   CONTINUED:	(2)	once she's in position, Odo turns and faces the guests. 	Jeyal stands in the back looking defiant and dubious.	Though Odo's introductory remarks are stock, his voice 	is halting, and he spends an inordinate amount of time 	looking down at the floor.					ODO			In keeping with Tavnian tradition, 			I stand before you -- here in my 			home, among my worldly possessions -- 			in order to declare my wish to add 			this woman to that which is mine...	He clears his throat, continues in an almost hurried tone.					ODO			She is as kind as she is 			beautiful... and I want her to be 			part of my life from this day on.	Hoping this will be enough, he turns to Lwaxana, offers 	her a hand...					ODO			Marry me, Lwaxana...	But before Lwaxana can react, Jeyal interrupts the 	ceremony...					JEYAL			Am I the only one here who finds 			this little more than a pale 			declaration of love?	Our people react to this outburst, unsure what to do.					JEYAL			He could be talking about any 			woman.	Lwaxana shoots Odo a do-something look, and he gathers 	his resolve, speaks over the hushed words being 	exchanged by our people.					ODO			Lwaxana isn't just any woman.	Our people fall silent, turn to listen to what Odo will 	say.					ODO			Not to me.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FOUR      40A.35   CONTINUED:	(3)	We hear another level of sincerity in Odo's tone -- 	he's realized he has to dig deep and speak truthfully 	about Lwaxana if he's going to convince Jeyal.					ODO			Before I met her, my world was a			much smaller place. I kept to 			myself. I didn't need anyone 			else... and I took pride in that.	He looks up at her, and she gives him an encouraging 	smile. Odo hesitates, then pushes himself to make a 	difficult admission.					ODO			The truth is... I was ashamed of 			what I was... afraid that if 			people saw how truly different I 			was... they would recoil from me.	Reactions -- Kira... O'Brien... Quark.					ODO			Lwaxana saw how different I was... 			but she didn't recoil. She wanted 			to see more.	Odo shakes his head, as if he still can't quite believe 	it.					ODO			For the first time in my life, 			someone wanted me as I was. And 			that changed me... forever.	Jeyal takes in Odo's words, their undeniable 	sincerity...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FOUR       41.35   CONTINUED:	(4)	Odo looks up at Lwaxana, wants her to see he means it.					ODO			The day I met her, is the day 			I stopped being alone.	Lwaxana smiles, touched and moved by his words...					ODO			And I want her to be part of my 			life from this day on.	Now, having earned it, Odo reaches his hand up to her 	with confidence... and speaks the ritual words that 	complete the ceremony.					ODO			Marry me, Lwaxana... let me into 			your light...	It's up to Lwaxana to offer her hand and accept him, 	but she's so overwhelmed by his words that she's 	momentarily speechless. After a beat, Odo gently 	reminds her...					ODO			Lwaxana... ?	She realizes, offers him her hand. He steps up onto 	the pedestal with her, into the gentle glow cast by the 	candle in her hand.					LWAXANA				(with emotion)			I give myself to you... forever 			and always.	They look at each other for a long moment, then turn 	and look out at their guests.					ODO			I say for all to hear... that this 			woman is mine.

Finally, he looks down... he's not going to 	object.37   ON ODO AND LWAXANA					ODO			I present to you... my beloved 			wife...	After a moment, the guests break into applause. We can 	see on their faces that they too were unexpectedly 	moved by Odo's heartfelt words.	Odo steps off the podium, helps Lwaxana down, and they 	move to join their guests. Everyone gathers round to 	offer their congratulations.	After a few moments of this, Lwaxana turns away from 	someone and finds Jeyal standing behind her. He has 	something to say to her, and because he's too proud to 	make a scene, he's careful not to get upset or raise 	his voice.					JEYAL			I cherished you, Lwaxana... you 			were my most treasured possession.	His face softening just a bit...					JEYAL			Take care of our son. When he 			asks, speak well of me...	Lwaxana hesitates, then smiles kindly and nods that she 	will. Jeyal turns away, and marshalling all his 	dignity, EXITS without looking back...	Like the others, Quark is swept up in the good cheer of 	the moment and is oblivious to what just happened. He 	raises his voice to get everyone's attention.					QUARK			Ladies and Gentlemen... please do			me the honor of accompanying me to 			my humble establishment. I'm 			throwing a party for the happy 			couple!	A chorus of approval from the others. Dax shoots Quark 	a questioning look.					QUARK			What can I say?

For a 			minute there, even I believed you 			wanted to marry me.	Odo features falter... it's as if he was so caught up 	in the moment he forgot it was supposed to be a ruse.					LWAXANA				(re: the guests)			I suppose we should tell them the 			truth...				(mischievous)			But let's wait till after the 			party.	She moves to join the others as they start to EXIT for 	Quark's.

I thought you were planning 			to have the baby here.					LWAXANA			If I did, I'd end up staying for 			months. And that wouldn't be 			fair. I've imposed on you enough.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FIVE       53.51   CONTINUED:					ODO			Lwaxana...				(searching for reasons)			You could deliver at any time now, 			and it's a long way to Betazed.				(insistent)			You really should stay.	She smiles, pleased that he wants her to... but as she 	looks at his face she begins to realize what's really 	going on, and her look changes to one of tenderness and 	sympathy. After a moment...					LWAXANA			I'll miss you, too.					ODO			Then why leave?					LWAXANA			You've gotten used to having me 			around, haven't you? You dear, 			sweet man. But don't you see, 			what you want is company, someone 			to take care of.	Odo is a little embarrassed to admit it, but she's 	right.					ODO			Is that so wrong?					LWAXANA			No, of course not. The problem 			is... I want much more than that 			from you. I can't help it. I'm 			still in love with you. And as 			much as I wish you were in love 			with me, I know you're not.	She looks up at Odo, continues with some difficulty...					LWAXANA			I could stay, try to make you fall 			in love with me... but we both 			know that's not going to happen. 			I'd end up resenting you... and 			your friendship is too important 			for me to let that happen.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/21/96 - ACT FIVE       54.51   CONTINUED:	(2)					LWAXANA (Cont'd)				(with a sad smile)			That's why it's better for both of			us if I leave now...	They regard each other for a long moment... Odo has 	realized she's right, and is grateful to her for seeing 	the truth.	She leans in, kisses him tenderly on the cheek.					LWAXANA			Good bye... husband...					ODO			Good bye... wife...	With a final look between them, she EXITS to the 	Promenade. Off Odo's features as he watches her go...52   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS	where Jake is on the couch convalescing, maybe curled 	up with a THROW. On the low table in front of him we 	see a glass of JUICE, the remains of a meal.	Sisko ENTERS from his bedroom with the pages Jake wrote 	while he was with Onaya.					SISKO			How you feeling?					JAKE			Okay, I guess...				(seeing the pages)			You've read it.					SISKO			Just finished.					JAKE			What'd you think?	Sisko comes and sits next to him.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/16/96 ACT FIVE        55.52   CONTINUED:					SISKO			You've got a good start on a novel 			here, Jake.				(smiles)			Your spelling's still terrible, 			but the dialogue is sharp, the 			story's involving, the characters 			are real...				(a sly smile)			I especially liked the father.					JAKE			Remind you of anyone?					SISKO			A bit.				(proud of him)			It's really good.	But Jake is unable to take any pride in it.					JAKE			I know. I just wish I wrote it.					SISKO			You did.	Jake lets out a worried breath...					JAKE			How can I be sure? I mean... 			without Onaya...					SISKO			Listen to me. You wrote these 			words, not her. 					JAKE			But she got them out of me.					SISKO				(setting the pages aside)			And that means they were somewhere 			inside you.	Jake hears the conviction in his father's voice and 	can't help but be reassured by it.					SISKO			All you have to do is learn to 			find them for yourself.	Jake nods, understanding the challenge before him. He 	looks over at the pages with a mixture of pride and 	trepidation.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Muse" - REV. 02/16/96 - ACT FIVE       56.52   CONTINUED:	(2)					JAKE			You're right... But I've got to 			tell you, I don't feel up to 			writing just yet.					SISKO			That's understandable. Take it 			easy for a while. You'll get back 			to it. And someday, when you're 			ready, maybe you'll even finish 			this.					JAKE			I hope so.					SISKO				(kissing him)			I gotta get to work.	Sisko stands and crosses to the door.					SISKO			I'll check in on you in a couple hours.					JAKE			I'll be here.	Sisko EXITS. Jake considers for a moment, then leans 	forward and picks the pen Onaya gave him off the table. 	He holds it for a beat, considers the events of the 	last few days.	He looks at the stack of pages on the table, uncaps the 	pen...53   INCLUDE - THE TITLE PAGE	Written in Jake's hand, just above the center of the 	page, we see the novel's title:					ANSLEM	Underneath it, he now writes...					by Jake Sisko	Hold on him as he looks down at his unfinished work, 	the work he's at once proud of and intimidated by... 	off this image we...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
