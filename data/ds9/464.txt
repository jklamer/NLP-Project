REPLIMAT	GARAK and BASHIR are at their usual table, eating their 	traditional lunch.					BASHIR			You're sure I can't interest you in 			some Yigrish cream pie.					GARAK			Thank you, Doctor, but I'm quite 			full.					BASHIR			You barely touched your food.					GARAK				(embarrassed)			The truth is, I've been trying to 			lose a little weight.  Hemming women's 			dresses may provide me with a modest 			income, but it doesn't offer much in 			the way of exercise.					BASHIR			If you'd like, I could help you set 			up an exercise program in one of the 			holosuites.					GARAK			I might take you up on that.  But 			speaking of holosuites...	Garak takes out an isolinear rod with a ribbon around it and 	hands it to Bashir.					GARAK			Happy Birthday.  I know it's a few 			days off, but I wanted to give you 			your present early.					BASHIR			Thank you, Garak.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - TEASER           2.1    CONTINUED:					GARAK			It's a Cardassian holosuite program.  			An adaptation of one of Shoggoth's 			enigma tales.					BASHIR			I see.					GARAK			You sound disappointed.  I thought 			you liked mystery novels.					BASHIR			I do.  Human mystery novels.  The 			problem with Cardassian enigma tales 			is that they all end the same way.  			All the suspects are always guilty.					GARAK			Yes, but the challenge comes from 			determining exactly who is guilty of 			what.				(a beat)			Is Lieutenant Dax throwing you another 			"surprise" party this year?					BASHIR				(glum)			So I'm told.					GARAK			You don't seem very enthused about 			it.					BASHIR			It's not that I don't appreciate all 			the trouble she goes to.  But the 			thing of it is... this year's a little 			different.					GARAK			How so?					BASHIR			This will be my thirtieth birthday.					GARAK			And?					BASHIR			You know, Garak, sometimes I forget 			you're not human.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - TEASER           3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK				(smiling)			It's an important thing to keep in 			mind, Doctor.					BASHIR			Well, in many human cultures, the 			thirtieth birthday is considered a 			sort of milestone.  It marks the end 			of youth and the beginning of the 			slow march into middle age.					GARAK			And that's... considered bad?					BASHIR			No.  It's just that... once you hit 			thirty, it becomes harder and harder 			to ignore the passage of time.					GARAK			Doctor, are you trying to say that 			you're afraid of growing old.					BASHIR			Of course not.  It's nothing to do 			with fear.  I'm just having a 			little... difficulty accepting the 			aging process.					GARAK			I wasn't aware that humans saw growing 			old as a negative experience.  On 			Cardassia, advanced age is seen as a 			sign of power and dignity.					BASHIR				(defensive)			I'm well aware that aging is part of 			the natural cycle of life.  I just 			don't want to be reminded of it.				(exasperated)			Look, Garak, the fact is, in two 			days I turn thirty, and if I want to 			be grumpy about it, that's my 			prerogative.					GARAK			By all means, Doctor, be as grumpy 			as you want.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - TEASER           4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR				(sort of means it)			I appreciate the support.2    NEW ANGLE	As QUARK approaches their table, accompanied by a hulking, 	hideous looking alien, ALTOVAR.  Quark looks a little nervous.					QUARK			Excuse me, Doctor.  Do you have a 			moment?					BASHIR			What can I do for you, Quark?	Quark glances over his shoulder at the looming alien.					QUARK			Uh... my friend... Altovar here is 			looking to purchase a small quantity 			of...				(embarrassed)			Bio-memetic gel.  And I was wondering 			if you might know how he could obtain, 			let's say, a few hundred milliliters.	Bashir looks suspiciously at the alien.					BASHIR			Bio-memetic gel is a restricted 			substance.  Its sale is strictly 			forbidden by Federation law.					QUARK				(relieved)			I thought so.				(to Altovar)			You see.  I told you.	But Altovar makes no move to leave.					ALTOVAR				(to Bashir)			I'm willing to pay whatever's 			necessary.  Name your price.					BASHIR			Why do you need it?					ALTOVAR			That's my business.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - TEASER           5.2    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			I'm sorry, but Bio-memetic gel can 			be very hazardous if not handled 			correctly.  It's not for sale.  At 			any price.	There's a beat as the alien stares at Bashir.  Quark tries 	to break the moment.					QUARK			Well, we tried.  Thank you, Doctor.	The alien just stares at Bashir for a long beat, then finally 	turns and walks away.					BASHIR			Quark, you should warn your friend 			that even attempting to obtain Bio-			memetic gel is a felony under 			Federation law.					QUARK			I know.  I told him that.  But he 			insisted that I ask you anyway.  			Letheans can be incredibly stubborn.				(a beat)			I hope you'll forgive the 			interruption.	Quark turns to leave, then looks back at their plates.					QUARK			You know, we just introduced a new 			lunch menu at the bar.					BASHIR				(with an edge)			Good-bye, Quark.					GARAK				(to Quark)			Don't take it personally.				(conspiratorial)			He's turning thirty.	Bashir makes a sour face.  Garak smiles.3    INT. STATION CORRIDOR	Bashir is walking down the hallway.  The Turbolift doors 	open and DAX EXITS.  She sees Julian and, smiling, falls 	into step beside him.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - TEASER           6.3    CONTINUED:					DAX				(glad to see him)			Julian.  What's new?					BASHIR			Dax, if you're trying to find out if 			I know about my "surprise party" 			Chief O'Brien has already told me 			about it.					DAX			He did?  That does it.  That's the 			last surprise party I let him help 			me plan.  Every year he insists on 			being involved, and every year he 			manages to spoil the surprise.					BASHIR			The chief's a man of many talents, 			but keeping a secret isn't one of 			them.					DAX				(playful)			Well now that you know about it, you 			may as well help with the final 			details.  We've narrowed the choices 			down to two different holosuite 			programs.  Would you rather have 			your party at a Greek palace on Mount 			Olympus or at Louis Pasteur's house 			in Paris?  Or as Quark put it, wood 			nymphs or can-can girls?					BASHIR			I'm going to have to think about 			that one.					DAX			Of course there's always game seven 			of the nineteen sixty-four World 			Series.					BASHIR			Let me guess... Commander Sisko's 			idea.					DAX			He says that's one of the greatest 			baseball games of all time.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - TEASER           7.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR			If you care about that sort of thing.				(a beat)			So why don't we say...				(makes up his mind)			Wood nymphs.					DAX			I knew it.  I'll tell Quark first 			thing in the morning.				(grins evilly)			Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to 			have a little chat with Chief O'Brien.					BASHIR			It's pretty late.  He's probably 			asleep.					DAX				(mischievous)			Good.  I'll wake him.	And with that Dax walks off.  Bashir smiles and watches her 	go.4    INT. INFIRMARY	Bashir ENTERS the darkened Infirmary.					BASHIR			Lights.	The lights come on, but to Bashir's surprise, Altovar, the 	alien from the Promenade, is ransacking the storage shelves.					BASHIR			What do you think you're doing?	In response to Bashir's challenge, Altovar tries to escape.  	Bashir rushes to block his EXIT.  They struggle.  Bashir 	gets in one or two good punches, but then...5    CLOSE ON BASHIR (OPTICAL)	Altovar grabs Bashir by the temples.  Some kind of electrical 	discharge arcs from the alien's hand to Bashir's head.  Bashir 	convulses and then goes limp, collapsing to the floor.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - TEASER           8.5    CONTINUED:	Altovar hurries out of the room.  Hold on Bashir's 	unconscious face for a beat, and then...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - ACT ONE          9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(Note:  Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)6    INT. INFIRMARY	Close on Bashir as he slowly regains consciousness.  The 	lights in the Infirmary are flickering fitfully and the 	monitors are full of static.	As Bashir gets up, we see traces of gray hairs at his temples.  	The effect is subtle, but enough to make him look slightly 	older.	Bashir looks around at the ransacked medical supply shelves, 	the flickering lights and the inoperative monitors.  He's 	still a little disoriented and surprised by the strangeness 	of his surroundings.					BASHIR				(to com)			Bashir to Security.				(no answer)			Bashir to Ops.				(no answer)			This is Doctor Bashir.  Is anyone 			reading me?				(to com)			Computer, locate Commander Sisko.				(no answer, insistent)			Computer, please respond... Computer?	There's still no answer.  Bashir tries to manually access 	the computer at one of the consoles, but has no more luck 	than he did with verbal commands.  Almost absentmindedly, 	Bashir picks up a chair that was knocked over during his 	scuffle with Altovar.	As he puts the chair back in place, he suddenly stops, as we 	hear the faint, sibilant sound of distant whispering.  Though 	it's impossible to distinguish what is being said, we should 	get the distinct impression that more than one person is 	talking.					BASHIR				(looking around)			Hello?	There's no response, but the whispering continues.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - ACT ONE         10.6    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Is someone there?	The whispering continues, but it's no louder or more distinct.	Trying to follow the voices to their source, Bashir EXITS 	out the Promenade door.7    INT. PROMENADE	Bashir steps out of the Infirmary and into an eerily deserted 	Promenade.  There's not a soul in sight and any monitors 	that are visible display static.  The station lights continue 	to flicker.	Bashir walks out into the middle of the Promenade and looks 	up.  The upper level, like the lower level, is completely 	deserted.					BASHIR			Hello?  Is anybody here?	He begins walking from store to store, checking inside 	doorways, sometimes even disappearing in the store for a few 	seconds.					BASHIR				(to himself)			Where is everyone?	The whispers have even faded away.  The Promenade is empty 	and quiet.  Bashir catches his reflection in a mirrored 	surface.  He notices the graying around his temples.  But 	before he can completely absorb this change in his appearance, 	there's a CRASHING SOUND from Quark's.	Bashir goes to investigate.8    INT. QUARK'S	Bashir ENTERS.  The bar is dark, even darker than usual.  	The lighting is slightly surreal, almost chiaroscuro, with 	unexpected areas of light and shadow.  (There does not have 	to be any logical correlation between the lighting levels on 	the Promenade and in the bar.)  Some of the chairs and tables 	have been upturned and the monitors are full of static.	Bashir halts, allowing himself to get used to the darkness.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - ACT ONE         11.8    CONTINUED:	Suddenly Bashir hears a rustling behind the bar, followed 	by a muted whimpering.					BASHIR			Who's there?	Bashir cautiously approaches the bar and looks over it.9    BEHIND THE BAR	QUARK is huddled in a corner.  He looks terrified.					BASHIR			Quark?	Quark looks up at Bashir, his eyes filled with fear.  He 	tries to curl himself up even tighter.					BASHIR			It's all right.  It's me.  Bashir.	Bashir comes around the bar and approaches Quark, who tires 	to press himself back closer to the bulkhead.					BASHIR			What is it?  What's going on?  Tell 			me.	Bashir crouches down beside Quark.					QUARK			He's going to kill us.  He's going 			to kill us all.					BASHIR			Who?  Who are you so afraid of?				(off Quark's frightened 				look)			Where's Sisko?  What happened to the 			rest of the crew?	Quark shakes his head as if he doesn't know, and as if it 	doesn't matter.					BASHIR				(reassuring)			Look, why don't you come with me?  			We'll go try to find them.					QUARK			No.  Don't you see.  If we move, 			he'll find us.  But if we stay here, 			we might be safe.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - ACT ONE         12.9    CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(insistent)			Safe from whom?				(a beat)			Quark, you have to tell me.	But before Quark can answer, there is noise from the second 	level of the bar.					QUARK				(whispered)			He's here.	Bashir looks over the bar to see who's up there, but it's 	too dark.  And now the sounds of movement are unmistakable.					BASHIR			We've got to get these lights back 			on.	Quark shakes his head, his panic building.					QUARK			It's too late.  He's found us.  We've 			got to get out.	And Quark suddenly makes a dash for the EXIT.					BASHIR			Wait.	But Quark scampers out the door.10   CLOSE ON BASHIR	Now alone behind the bar.  For a moment he's torn between 	going after Quark and staying to find out who's approaching 	from out of the darkness.  The noise of movement keeps getting 	louder.  Finally Bashir stands and defiantly looks out at 	the darkness.					BASHIR			Who's there?  Show yourself.	Suddenly a table comes flying at Bashir out of the darkness.  	Bashir narrowly avoids it by ducking back behind the bar.  	The table is followed by the sounds of furniture being broken 	as the room is destroyed.  Bashir is unarmed and doesn't 	know what he's up against.  He decides not to take any chances 	and retreats back to...          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - ACT ONE         13.11   INT. PROMENADE	Bashir ENTERS the Promenade from Quark's.  Behind him, the 	sounds of destruction inside the bar continue.  Bashir looks 	around for Quark.					BASHIR				(calling sotto voice)			Quark?  Quark!	But there's no answer and after a beat, Bashir continues 	down the Promenade.12   INT. REPLIMAT	The Replimat is deserted and the lights are low (though 	not as low as Quark's).	Bashir ENTERS.  He's disappointed to find the area deserted, 	but by now, he's not surprised.  We hear the sound of pouring 	liquid.  Bashir reacts to the noise and notices something 	strange about the replicators.13   CLOSE ON ONE OF THE REPLICATORS	Which is pouring out a slow and steady stream of a light 	brown, watery liquid.14   ANGLE ON BASHIR	As he approaches the replicator.  The liquid continues to 	pour.  Bashir looks at it closely, then dips his finger in 	the stream and tentatively tastes it.					BASHIR				(perplexed)			Tarkalean Tea?	This explains nothing to Bashir.  If anything, it makes the 	situation even stranger.  Bashir looks across at the other 	replicator, which is also pouring liquid.  But before he can 	go investigate, he hears a scraping noise from down the 	Promenade.14A  ANGLE ON SECURITY - BASHIR'S P.O.V.	Bashir looks toward the source of the sound, which seems to 	have come from Odo's office.					BASHIR			Constable?	There's no answer.  The doors to the office are closed and 	the lights are off.  Bashir moves cautiously toward Odo's 	office.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - ACT ONE         14.15   INT. SECURITY OFFICE	Bashir ENTERS, but before he gets very far, he is grabbed 	from behind and slammed into a bulkhead.  Bashir tries to 	fight back, but then realizes his assailant is none other 	than Garak.					BASHIR			Garak?					GARAK			What are you doing here, Doctor?					BASHIR			I was about to ask you the same thing.					GARAK			I was looking for Constable Odo.  			Everyone on this station seems to 			have disappeared.					BASHIR			Not everyone.  I just saw Quark.  He 			was cowering behind his bar.  He 			thinks someone is terrorizing the 			station.  And I'm not sure I disagree 			with him.					GARAK			What do you mean?  Tell me what's 			going on.					BASHIR			There was some... thing in Quark's... 			tearing up the place.  I never got a 			good look at it, but believe me, it 			wasn't friendly.	During the above, Bashir crosses over to Odo's desk and begins 	trying to access the main computer.  The console is full of 	static.					BASHIR				(to com)			Computer.          DEEP SPACE: "Distant Voices" - 01/11/95 - ACT ONE         15.15   CONTINUED:					GARAK			It's no use.  As far as I can tell, 			the station's suffered some kind of 			massive systems failure.  Aside from 			life support, and simple functions 			like turbolifts and doors, nothing 			seems to be working.  It's been like 			this for hours.  I was up late 			programming some replicator patterns 			for a suit I'm designing, and 			everything just went dead.					BASHIR			I can't believe that you, Quark and 			I are the only people left on the 			station.  Sisko and the others must 			be here somewhere.					GARAK			Maybe.  Or maybe they've fallen victim 			to some kind of rampant virus, or 			space anomaly, or Dominion plot.					BASHIR			All the more reason to try to locate 			them.	Bashir pauses as he tries to formulate a plan of action.  	But as he does so, we begin to hear the distant whispers 	once again.					BASHIR			Wait.  Do you hear that?					GARAK			Hear what?					BASHIR			That sound.  It's like voices 			whispering.					GARAK			I don't hear anything.
