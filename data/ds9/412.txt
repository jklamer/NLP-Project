His eyes range over the 	sparse crowd as he crosses to the bar.  At the far end of 	the bar, a figure wearing nondescript clothes sits, drinking 	alone (CRODEN).  He wears a locket on a chain around his 	neck.  Odo moves halfway toward him to his usual spot at the 	bar, deliberately makes eye contact with the alien who looks 	away.  Odo already has him marked for suspicion.  QUARK moves 	over.					QUARK				(sarcastic)			The usual, Odo?					ODO			Nothing.					QUARK				(nods)			The usual.	Odo ignores the barb, his attention still generally focussed 	in Croden's direction.					QUARK				(continuing)			If all my customers were like you, 			my family would be begging on the 			Promenade.					ODO			Oh, I seriously doubt that.

The one the Klingons 			brought back from the Gamma Quadrant.	Quark looks, makes a point of "discovering" Croden sitting 	there... Croden musing about his drink.					QUARK			Croden?

I believe a pair of twinned 			Miradorns just nodded your way.					QUARK			I'm the man behind the bar.  			Obviously, they want to use a 			holosuite.	Quark must get on with his plans... trying to cover by 	reacting indignantly to Odo's suspicions... moving away down 	the bar... shaking his head, "incredulous"... louder --            DEEP SPACE: "Vortex" - REV. 1/13/93 - TEASER             4.4    CONTINUED:					QUARK				(continuing)			You think the whole galaxy is plotting 			around you, don'tcha... paranoia 			must run in your species, Odo... 			maybe that's why no one's ever seen 			another shape-shifter... they're all 			hiding.	Croden and others look up at the outburst.
