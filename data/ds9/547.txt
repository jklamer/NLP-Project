QUARK'S QUARTERS	CLOSE ON QUARK reading a PADD and shaking his head in 	amazement.					QUARK			I'm truly impressed.	ADJUST TO REVEAL a beautiful, Amazonian, young dabo 	girl, ALUURA, seated in a chair, drinking up Quark's 	praise.					QUARK			And I'm not easily impressed. In 			all my years as proprietor of 			Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House 			and Holosuite Arcade, I have never 			seen such a glowing employee 			performance report. I mean look 			at this --	Quark holds the PADD up for Aluura to see.					QUARK			-- in three months, no customer 			has filed a single complaint 			against you. You haven't spilled 			a drink or mixed up a food order 			or shortchanged a bill.					ALUURA			I take my job very seriously.					QUARK 			And yet you always manage to wear 			a friendly smile.					ALUURA 			That's because I like my work. 			I'm happy to be here.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit... " - REV. 3/25/98 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED					QUARK 			It shows. The customers love you, 			your fellow dabo girls love 			you -- even the Ferengi waiters 			sing your praises. And you know 			why? Because you're nice.					ALUURA			I try to be.					QUARK 			You're nice to the customers, to 			the dabo girls, to the Ferengi 			waiters. You're nice to everyone. 				(a beat) 			Almost everyone.	That catches Aluura's attention; she can't think of who 	she could possibly have insulted.					ALUURA			You mean I've offended someone?	A distressed Aluura rises from the chair.					QUARK 			Look closely, Aluura. Can't you 			see the pain in my eyes?	She stares at Quark.					ALUURA			But I'm always nice to you.	Quark shakes his head regretfully. There's a long beat 	as the coin drops.					QUARK			I think you could be nicer.					ALUURA				(concerned)			How much nicer?	Quark reaches over and hands her another PADD.					ALUURA				(reading)			"Oo-mox for Fun and Profit."        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit...

And they 			can't fire you.2    OMITTED3    NEW ANGLE	as the door OPENS and a frantic ROM comes racing in.					ROM			Brother! We need to talk.	Quark's eyes remain glued on Aluura.					QUARK 			Go away. I'm in the middle of a 			meeting.					ROM 			But it's important.					QUARK 			So's the meeting.					ROM			It's about our mother.					QUARK 			How many times have I told you not 			to mention Moogie when I'm...				(indicating Aluura)			... you know, working.					ROM 			Sorry.				(proceeding) 			But I tried contacting her this 			morning, and I couldn't get 			through.	Quark returns his head to Aluura's chest, clearly 	unperturbed by this news.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit... " - REV. 3/25/98 - TEASER         4.3    CONTINUED:					QUARK 			She's probably off "visiting" the 			Grand Nagus.					ROM 			I tried the Tower of Commerce. 			There was no answer there either.					QUARK 			They're probably on vacation. Now 			leave me alone, I'm trying to 			concentrate.					ROM 			Brother, you don't understand.			I can't get a hold of anyone on 			Ferenginar. Not Cousin Gaila, not 			Lek... I tell you, something's 			very wrong.	That gets Quark's attention.					QUARK				(to Aluura) 			We'll continue this later. In the 			meantime, you've got some reading 			to do.	Having said what he came to say, Rom finally notices 	Aluura.					ROM 			Hello, Aluura.				(looking at the PADD) 			Good book.	Quark grabs Rom by the elbow.					QUARK 			Let's go.	As Quark leads Rom away, Rom looks back at Aluura.					ROM			She's so nice.					QUARK 			We'll see.	And with that, he hustles his brother out of the room.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit...

WORF and DAX are at their stations.					SISKO			A Dominion invasion of Ferenginar?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit.. " - REV. 3/25/98 - TEASER         5.4    CONTINUED:					ROM 			Think of the terrible 			repercussions to the Alpha 			Quadrant.					WORF 			I can't think of any.					KIRA				(to Quark and Rom) 			How could the Dominion invade 			Ferenginar without first 			conquering the systems surrounding 			it like Clarus and Irtok?					ROM				(to Quark) 			Brother, did you hear that? 			They've captured Irtok as well.					KIRA			That's not what I said.					WORF				(to Sisko) 			There are no reports of Dominion 			activity anywhere near that sector.					QUARK			Then why can't we get through to 			Ferenginar?					ROM			Moogie, the Nagus, Cousin Gaila...	Rom buries his head in Quark's shoulder.					ROM			... they're all dead.					QUARK			We don't know that.				(to Sisko)			But something's definitely wrong			on Ferenginar.					SISKO			We'll see what we can find out.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit...

AIRLOCK CORRIDOR	The airlock door OPENS to reveal GRAND NAGUS ZEK and 	ISHKA holding hands as they step out of the airlock. 	Though both Zek and Ishka seem quite jovial and 	content, MAIHAR'DU, Zek's faithful Hupyrian servant, 	seems as if he's carrying the weight of the world on 	his broad shoulders. (Note: the Nagus should NOT be 	carrying his familiar cane.)					ZEK			Quark! Rom!	PULL BACK TO REVEAL Quark and Rom waiting for them.					ZEK			It's good to see you boys.					QUARK			It's good to see you, too, Nagus.	Rom rushes up to hug his mother.					ROM			Moogie! I was so worried...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit...

What if one of my			Ferengi waiters sees you?					ISHKA			I hope they do. Tell them, Zekkie.					ZEK			No, you go right ahead, my dear.					ISHKA				(insisting)			It should really come from you.					QUARK				(impatient)			Would somebody please tell me			what's going on?					ISHKA			It's one of those good-news-bad-			news type of things...				(nudging Zek)			Give them the good news first.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit...

Three days ago, 			I added a new amendment to the 			Ferengi Bill of Opportunities 			giving females the right to wear 			clothes.					ROM				(shocked) 			In public?					ISHKA 			Anywhere we want.					QUARK 			That can't be the good news. If 			Ferengi females can wear clothes 			in public, they can leave their 			homes. If they can leave their 			homes, they can go to work. If 			they can go to work, they can make 			profit.					ISHKA 			What's the matter, Quark? Afraid 			of a little competition?					QUARK				(to Zek) 			You're sure that's the good news?					ROM				(smiling) 			It sounds good to me.					ISHKA				(to Quark, re: Rom) 			Now do you see why I like him best?					ZEK 			Face it, Quark. It's good 			business. For thousands of years, 			Ferenginar has allowed a valuable 			resource to go to waste.					QUARK 			Females? A valuable resource?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit...

I say 			it's time they started pulling 			their own weight.					QUARK 			You better tell me the bad 			news -- it might cheer me up.					ISHKA 			I doubt it.					ZEK 			The moment fully clothed females 			began appearing on the streets of 			Ferenginar, financial chaos 			erupted all over the planet.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Profit...

"The slimiest cola in the 			galaxy." That kind of slogan 			doesn't appeal to women.					NILVA 			And what would?					QUARK				(thinking on his feet) 			Let me see...
