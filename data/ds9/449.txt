He is thoroughly drunk and he looks even more 	thoroughly disreputable: he sways unsteadily in his chair, 	his hair is matted and unkempt, and his clothes look like 	he's been wearing them for days.  Quark rolls his eyes as 	Rom tries to sound more encouraging.					ROM			At least someone is still here.					QUARK			How many has he had?					ROM			A dozen...	Rom scurries off to get another drink for Kozak.  Quark sits 	down on one of the barstools and contemplates his fortunes.					QUARK				(to himself)			I should've gone into insurance... 			better hours... more money... less 			scruples...	Rom returns from Kozak's table and approaches Quark with 	trepidation -- there's something he doesn't want to tell his 	brother.  But Quark is into his own little reverie and he is 	oblivious to Rom's nervousness.					QUARK			It's all Sisko's fault.	Rom glances nervously back at the Klingon.					ROM			Sisko?					QUARK			That's right.  If he'd handled things 			better with the Dominion, none of 			this would've happened.  They want a 			foothold in the Alpha Quadrant?

Look around Rom, do you 			think we're in any condition to be 			offering credit?					ROM			No, but you know how difficult 			Klingons can be.					QUARK			You just have to show a little 			backbone.  Once they realize you 			mean business, they always back down.	Rom glances over at Kozak in fear.  Quark gets up with a 	mixture of disgust and anger.					QUARK			I'll handle this.

Kozak is nearly falling 	out of his chair at this point.  Quark draws himself up to 	his full height and plants himself before Kozak.					QUARK				(loud and firm)			My name is Quark.	Kozak looks up at him... and the moment he does, Quark's 	entire demeanor collapses into a posture of obsequious 	servility.					QUARK				(continuing, humble)			And I would like to discuss... 			arranging a line of credit...	But Kozak is in a drunken haze and doesn't even understand 	what Quark is saying.  He gets unsteadily to his feet... 	he's swaying dangerously as he towers over Quark.					KOZAK				(drunk)			You dare speak to me like that... 			you pathetic mak'dar...	Kozak's eyes suddenly flare in rage and he pulls a KNIFE 	from his belt and charges at Quark with a drunken ROAR OF 	ANGER.  Quark tries to get out of the way, but Kozak is too 	big and moving too fast... Kozak swings the knife... Quark 	throws up a feeble hand in defense... but Kozak is so drunk 	that he STUMBLES over his own feet... his vast bulk coming 	down on top of Quark, who SCREAMS in terror.  They both crash 	to the deck.	Rom watches in horror as the two men lie still on the ground, 	Kozak on top of Quark.  There's a beat, then Kozak falls off 	of Quark and onto his back.  The knife is sticking out of 	his chest... Quark looks at him in shock.  The huge Klingon 	is dead.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                     DEEP SPACE: "The House...

Kozak's body is on a medical gurney... the knife 	sticking out of his chest.  BASHIR is checking over the body 	with a tricorder, while an N.D. NURSE stands by.  ODO is 	looking over the area near the body.  There are two N.D. 	SECURITY GUARDS standing at the entrance to keep back the 	LARGE CROWD of curious passersby who are straining to get a 	glimpse of what's going on.	Quark and Rom are near the bar, just out of earshot from the 	death scene.  Rom is nervous and agitated, while Quark is 	staring at the crowd just outside the entrance like a starving 	man looking at his first meal in days.					ROM				(re: Kozak's body)			How long are they going to leave... 			him there?  I wish they would hurry 			up and get rid of him.					QUARK			I wish we could put him on display...					ROM			What?					QUARK			Look at them, Rom... they're consumed 			with morbid fascination... they can't 			wait to get in here...	Quark takes another step toward the crowd, thinking rapidly.					QUARK				(continuing)			They all want to know what happened.  			Was it a bar fight?

I killed him in self-			defense.					ROM			But where is the profit in lying 			about a simple --	Quark grabs Rom by the earlobe and jerks his head to face 	the crowd.  Rom winces in pain.					QUARK			Look at that crowd.  How long has it 			been since you've seen that many 			customers waiting to get in here.  			This is an opportunity to turn 			everything around.	Quark releases Rom, who rubs his ear in pain.					ROM			This is insane Brother.

Bashir has finished with the body, and the 	Nurse takes it away on the gurney.  Bashir now begins to 	listen as well.           DEEP SPACE: "The House...

I was about to call 			for security to throw him out of my 			bar when suddenly he pulled a knife 			on me!	The crowd is mesmerized by the tale and this only propels 	Quark more.  He throws himself into the story.					QUARK				(continuing)			I avoided the first thrust... he 			came at me again... I hit him with a 			left jab... there was a furious 			exchange of blows.  The next thing I 			knew, his knife was at my throat... 			so I twisted it from his grasp and 			plunged it into his chest.				(beat, then solemn)			I'll never forget the look on his 			face as his life drained away.  It 			was... I'd rather not talk about it 			anymore.	Quark turns away, apparently moved by the memory, and the 	Crowd begins talking animatedly among themselves.  Odo 	gives him a skeptical look.					ODO			If you've finished your performance, 			I'd like to hear the real story now.					QUARK			You heard it.  And my brother is a 			witness.					ROM			That's right.					ODO			If this is some kind of joke... I'm 			not laughing, Quark.           DEEP SPACE: "The House...

A large group of 	patrons are hanging on every word as Quark narrates his tale.  	Quark's attitude is nonchalant, playing the part of a man 	who just "did what he had to do."					QUARK			Afraid?  Of course I was afraid, but 			that man was in my bar and he had a 			bill to pay.  And I wasn't going to 			have him walk out of here without 			paying it.           DEEP SPACE: "The House...

Quark takes a drink and looks around the bar with 	pleasure and then notices that Odo is sitting at the bar a 	short distance away watching him.					QUARK			Don't worry Constable, I won't be 			dispatching anymore customers today.  			You don't have to keep an eye on me.					ODO			Thank you for putting my mind at 			ease.

GOWRON is seated in the Council Leader's chair 	and the rest of the COUNCIL is standing to either side of 	him.  Standing before the Council is D'Ghor, who is in the 	middle of making his case before Gowron.					D'GHOR				(formally)			... there being no special 			circumstances in the death, and no 			male heir, I make claim to the title 			and property of this fallen House.					GOWRON			The Council has considered your 			petition and will grant the transfer 			once the final rituals have been --					GRILKA'S VOICE			The petition is out of order!	Gowron looks up and sees Grilka ENTERING the Great Hall.  	Gowron is not happy to see her, but his attitude is one of 	weariness, not animosity.  There is no bad blood between 	Grilka and Gowron, but Gowron is tiring of this particular 	matter.  D'Ghor regards her with obvious contempt.       DEEP SPACE: "The House...

He shows Bashir the PADD.					O'BRIEN			What do you think?					BASHIR			You're asking my opinion?	O'Brien just looks at him and refrains from observing that 	he's obviously asking his opinion.

Gowron's 	attitude is both shamed and disappointed.					GOWRON			What are you doing?	D'Ghor is genuinely shocked... he loosens his grip on the 	sword and Gowron pulls it away from him in disgust.					GOWRON			I didn't want to believe the things 			he said about you yesterday... but 			if you can stand here and... murder 			this pathetic little man, then you 			have no honor.  And you have no place 			in this hall.	Gowron throws the bat'leth to the ground, and then turns his 	back on D'Ghor.  The other Council members all turn away 	from D'Ghor, who has now been shamed before everyone.  Gowron 	signals to one of the Guards in the room, who then moves to 	D'Ghor.  D'Ghor stares at them all in disbelief... then turns 	and lets the Guard escort him from the room.  Gowron glances 	at Quark in a mixture of disbelief and admiration.					GOWRON				(shaking his head)			A brave Ferengi... who would have 			thought it possible?        DEEP SPACE: "The House...
