QUARK'S	KOR -- the boisterous, aging Klingon survivor of "Blood 	Oath" -- recounts a story, surrounded by a small GROUP 	that includes DAX, O'BRIEN, BASHIR, ODO and KIRA.					KOR			-- walls of fire on one side, 			rivers of lava on the other... we 			snaked our way through the hot, 			smoldering canyon, our skin so 			parched and blistered it was thick 			as armor. Kang, Koloth and I had 			set out with forty legions and 			now, only we three remained to 			face T'nag's army.	Fueled by bloodwine, Kor is a good raconteur, holding 	his audience spellbound.2    NEW ANGLE	WORF, sitting alone at the bar, listening to Kor with 	rapture.  QUARK approaches.					QUARK 			You know what I like about Klingon 			stories, Commander?	Worf could care less, but Quark presses forth.					QUARK 			Nothing. Lots of people die and 			nobody makes any profit.	Worf flashes a glare at Quark, who darts away.3    ON KOR	continuing his tale.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sword... " - REV. 10/02/95 - TEASER       2.3    CONTINUED:					KOR			Chanting a battle cry -- Koloth 			attacked their flank -- his eyes 			bulging with hate and revenge. It 			was a magnificent sight. A 			disruptor in one hand, his 			Bat'leth in the other -- I saw him 			kill two dozen men.4    ON BASHIR	leaning over to Kira and the others.					BASHIR 			Do you believe a word of this?					ODO 			Walking along rivers of lava... 			walls of fire? Not likely.					KIRA			And three against an army? Even 			more unlikely.					O'BRIEN 			Yeah, but who cares? He tells it 			well.5    BACK ON KOR	passionately orating.					KOR 			Kang took the high ground -- and 			keeping the three suns to his 			back, he forced the enemy to 			battle him against the blinding 			light.					DAX				(to Kor) 			When Kang told this story, you 			took the high ground.					KOR 			Who gets the credit is not 			important.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sword... " - REV. 10/16/95 - TEASER       3.5    CONTINUED:					KOR (Cont'd) 			What matters is that in the end, 			the mountainside was so covered 			with dead that not a square meter 			of ground could be seen. We found 			T'nag's body by the river, its 			waters red with blood. Which one 			of us had slain him, none could 			say for certain...	Kor holds out his hand in front of his face as if he 	were holding an apple.					KOR 			So we cut out his heart -- and the 			three of us feasted on it			together!					DAX			Big heart.	Kor LAUGHS and slaps her on the back, hard.					KOR 				(to Dax) 			You need more bloodwine.					DAX			Thanks -- but I've had enough to 			last me a year. I need some tea.6    ON DAX	moving over to the bar, where Worf has been watching 	Kor.					DAX 			Mister Worf -- I didn't see you 			come in.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sword... " - REV. 10/02/95 - TEASER       4.6    CONTINUED:					WORF			I was just leaving.					DAX			Why don't you join us? I'll 			introduce you to Kor.					WORF				(quickly) 			No.				(off her look) 			It might make the Dahar Master... 			uncomfortable. I am considered an 			outcast by most Klingons.					DAX			Kor is not like most Klingons.				(calling out) 			Kor!	Worf is very uncomfortable as Kor joins them.					DAX 			I'd like you to meet our strategic 			operations officer, Commander 			Worf.					KOR 			Ah, Worf the traitor. The pariah. 			The lowest of the low...	Worf wants to crawl into a hole.					KOR 			Pleasure to meet you. Any enemy 			of Gowron and the High Council is 			a friend of mine.	They grasp forearms in a Klingon handshake. Worf is taken 	aback, awestruck.					WORF 			This is a great honor.					KOR 			No doubt.	Worf doesn't really know what to say. Dax jumps in 	with:					DAX				(to Kor) 			Worf is a great admirer of yours.   DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sword... " - REV. 10/04/95 - TEASER 5-5A.      6    CONTINUED:	(2)					WORF			I've heard stories about you since 			I was a child. Your confrontation 			with Kirk on Organia, your attack 			on Romulus, your defense of the 			Korma Pass --					KOR 			Everything I've done pales in 			comparison to what I'm about to 			achieve.	Worf's interest is piqued.					KOR 			I'm on a quest... a quest for the 			most revered icon in Klingon 			history.					DAX				(a warning) 			Kor...					KOR				(caught up in the 				moment) 			An icon that predates the Klingon 			Empire, an icon more sacred than 			the Torch of G'boj --					DAX				(stronger) 			Kor...					KOR 			More revered than Sabak's armor, 			and more coveted than the 			Emperor's crown!					WORF				(awed) 			The Sword of Kahless.	Dax looks at Kor -- what are you doing?					DAX 			You told me not to tell anybody.					KOR				(what could I do?) 			He guessed!				(to Worf) 			I know where the Sword rests. 			Imagine the glory!       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sword... " - REV. 10/04/95 - TEASER       6.6    CONTINUED:	(3)					KOR (Cont'd) 			The honor of finding the Bat'leth 			of the first Warrior King...					WORF			Lost for a millennium... It's 			return would change Klingon 			history. If you know where it is 			we must bring it back to the 			Emperor.					KOR				(amused) 			We?					WORF			It would be an honor to accompany 			you.				(a beat) 			If you'll have me.					DAX				(smiles) 			We could use another strong arm...					KOR				(slapping him on the				back)			And a stout heart. Besides, it			will annoy Gowron.					WORF 			Returning the Sword to our 			people... I would give my life to 			do that.					KOR 			Children will sing our names for 			a thousand years! They'll erect 			statues of us in the Hall of 			Heroes.	Dax tries to inject a bit of reality.					DAX 			Before you decide on a pose for 			that statue -- we have to find the			Sword. What makes you so sure you 			know where it is?					KOR 			This.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sword... " - REV. 10/03/95 - TEASER       7.6    CONTINUED: 	Kor reaches into his vest and extracts a folded, 	tattered and frayed old piece of cloth. Kor unravels 	the cloth; the cloth is rimmed with bizarre 	hieroglyphics; there is a faint ink block-like spot 	extending the length of the cloth in the shape of a 	curved blade.					KOR			You see?					DAX			See what?					KOR			The imprint on the cloth --					WORF			Yes!				(touching it 				reverentially) 			This held the Sword of Kahless.					DAX			Don't be so sure... you could 			carpet this station with all the 			"authentic" Shrouds of the Sword 			people have tried to peddle.					KOR 			No one tried to peddle this -- it 			was given to me.					DAX			By whom?					KOR 			I'll tell you everything, later. 			Now, I need you to confirm its 			authenticity.	Dax is intrigued enough to offer:					DAX 			I'll look this over in the lab -- 			first thing in the morning.					WORF			Why not right now?					DAX			My head is swimming in bloodwine.			Right now --	Dax gets up to leave.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sword...

After I finish what's 			left in my cup.	Dax eyes him suspiciously. Kor lifts the glass to show 	her there is only a small amount of drink left.					KOR			Maj ram, blood brother.

What 			they could not pillage, they 			destroyed. They took the Sword 			and my people have been looking 			for it ever since.

He 	attacks unrestrained, taking down one of the Klingons 	and charging another.	Worf battles another Klingon with equal ferocity.	Dax, who can't get a clear shot with her phaser, picks 	up a Bat'leth from the fallen Klingon and joins the 	melee, fighting the Lethean. At first, her skill and 	quickness match the Lethean's size advantage, but his 	strength and power soon begin to overwhelm her.	In the meantime, Worf is being double teamed. He 	defeats one of them, but looses his weapon in the 	process.	Meanwhile, the Lethean is about to deliver a mortal 	blow on Dax -- Kor sees this and flings the Sword like 	a boomerang, impaling the Lethean through the back.	Worf scrambles to retrieve the Bat'leth from the 	Lethean's back, and with a series of very impressive 	moves, cuts the last Klingon enemy down.

This is not a clash between two titan 	Klingon warriors, this is brawl --an ugly, dirty, 	violent fight with Kor and Worf growling, clawing and 	scratching like wild dogs.	Both Klingons are spent from the fight with the 	Klingons, Worf's injury helps level the playing field. 	Furthermore, Worf's youth and strength advantage are 	matched by Kor's experience and unbridled street-	fighting skill -- and the fight could go either way.					DAX			Commander!	But Worf and Kor are oblivious and continue their ugly 	brawl.
