It's not like you're 			moving to Bajor. One G Twelve is 			practically right next door.					JAKE 			I know. But I'm not moving to one 			G twelve.	This takes Sisko by surprise.					JAKE				(continuing)			I found some great quarters in 			section M.					SISKO			That's all the way on the other 			side of the habitat ring.					JAKE 			Dad, don't get all sentimental on 			me.					SISKO			Wait until your son moves out on 			you.					JAKE			I don't have a son.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - TEASER        2.1    CONTINUED:					SISKO				(smiles)			Go ahead, make jokes. But one day 			you'll be standing where I am, and 			believe me, you won't like it any 			more than I do.					JAKE			Maybe, but right now, I'm standing 			here. And I can't wait to spend 			my first night in my own place.	With a final Herculean effort, Jake manages to close 	the case.					JAKE			See. I told you I'd get it.	Jake stands up, ready to leave. Sisko tries to show 	that he really is okay with this.					SISKO			Okay, let's see if I've got this 			straight. I can visit any time I 			want, but I have to call first. 			You won't be available for 			breakfast or lunch, but I can 			count on one dinner a week.					JAKE			Some weeks, maybe even two.					SISKO			I've raised a generous young man. 				(they hug)			You and Nog, moving in together. 			I can remember when I didn't even 			want you talking to him.					JAKE			Things change.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - TEASER        3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)	Sisko smiles sentimentally. That just about sums up 	what he's feeling now, as he's watched his son become 	a man.					SISKO			They sure do.2    INT. ROM'S QUARTERS	ROM, dressed in his maintenance uniform, is 	meticulously neatening his quarters, making sure 	everything is just so. His door CHIMES. Rom smiles 	with excited anticipation.					ROM			Come in.	The door opens and QUARK comes in carrying a heavy 	crate. Rom's face drops.					ROM			Oh. It's you.					QUARK			Who'd you think it was?					ROM			Nog.					QUARK				(exasperated)			How could it be Nog? His ship			hasn't even docked yet.					ROM				(smiling sheepishly)			I guess I wasn't thinking.					QUARK			So what else is new?	Quark elbows Rom aside and drops the crate down. It 	lands with a thud.					ROM			Can I help it if I'm excited? My			son is coming home.	Rom takes a bottle out of the crate and stares at it 	gleefully.					ROM			Root beer. His favorite. I don't			know how to thank you, brother.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - TEASER        4.2    CONTINUED:					QUARK 			Ten slips of latinum ought to do 			it.					ROM				(re: the root beer)			You think he'd mind if I had one 			for myself?					QUARK 			I'd mind. My own brother drinking 			root beer. It's so... Human.	Rom opens a bottle and takes a generous swig.					ROM 			Mmmm... And bubbly.	The door CHIMES again.					ROM 			That's him, that's him.	Quark rolls his eyes.					QUARK 			Rom.	Rom smiles.					ROM 			Just kidding.				(to the door)			Come in.3    NEW ANGLE	As the door opens and ODO ENTERS, looking very pleased 	with himself.					QUARK 			Wrong again.					ROM			Constable. Care for a root beer?					ODO			No. But you do have something I 			want.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - TEASER        5.3    CONTINUED:	Odo looks over at Quark.					QUARK 			Whatever it is, I didn't do it.					ODO			Don't tell me. Tell the 			Federation Grand Jury on Inferna 			Prime.	Quark tries to look surprised and innocent, but he 	knows he's neither and try as he might, he still looks 	guilty and worried.					ROM 				(alarmed)			Federation Grand Jury? Brother, 			what have you done now?					QUARK 			I haven't done anything.				(to Odo, rattled)			What do they want to talk to me 			for?					ODO 				(smug)			Oh, I think you know.	Quark does know, but he tries not to let on.					QUARK 			Odo, I have no idea what this is 			about.					ODO			Then you'll have eight days to try 			to guess. We leave immediately.					QUARK 			We?					ODO			I've been waiting ten years for 			you to get what you deserve. And 			now that the big moment is here, 			I wouldn't miss it for anything.	Odo grabs Quark by the shirt-sleeve and leads him out 	of the room.					ODO			Let's go.					ROM			Brother.					QUARK 			What?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - TEASER         3    CONTINUED:	(2)					ROM			I'll say "hi" to Nog for you.	Quark gives his brother a look of disdain and then is 	hauled out of the room.

SPACE (OPTICAL)	A Runabout traveling at warp.5    INT. RUNABOUT	Odo is at the pilot's seat, but the runabout is on auto-	pilot and Odo is taking the opportunity to read 	something from a PADD. Quark ENTERS from the back of 	the ship. He looks surprisingly chipper and he's 	holding a large round deck of cards that he shuffles 	absentmindedly.					QUARK 			So, how much longer until we reach 			Inferna Prime?	Odo glances at a readout.					ODO			Oh, I'd say... one hundred and 			ninety-one hours and seventeen 			minutes... give or take a day.	Odo goes right back to reading his PADD.					QUARK 			In that case, we'd better find 			something to keep ourselves 			occupied. Care for a game of 			fizzbin?					ODO			I don't play cards.					QUARK 			I'll teach you. It's a very 			simple game.					ODO			Let me put it another way... I 			don't want to play cards. And 			even if I did, I wouldn't want to 			play with you.					QUARK			Afraid you'd lose?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE       8.5    CONTINUED:	Odo turns his attention back to his PADD. Quark can 	see he's not going to get anywhere.					QUARK 			You know, Odo, I used to think all 			your problems stemmed from the 			fact that you were a changeling, 			isolated from your own kind, 			forced to live among strangers who 			didn't understand you. 				(a beat)			You couldn't eat, you couldn't 			drink, you couldn't sleep, you 			couldn't make love. Was it any 			wonder you had such a bad 			disposition?	Odo refuses to rise to the bait.					QUARK 			But now... you're not a changeling 			anymore. You're one of us. Life 			is yours for the taking. All you 			have to do is reach out and grab 			it. But do you? No. Because 			changeling or solid, you're still 			a miserable, self-hating 			misanthrope. That's who you are 			and that's who you'll always be.	Odo isn't even fazed.					ODO			I'm still not playing cards with 			you.					QUARK 			Fine, we'll just sit here for a 			week in silence.	Odo continues reading his PADD. Quark tries to stay 	quiet. He succeeds for only a few seconds.					QUARK			So what are you reading?					ODO			Nothing you'd be interested in.					QUARK 			Don't be so sure.	And then, with a quick move that surprises Odo, Quark 	grabs the PADD.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE       9.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO			Quark, give that back.					QUARK 			What are you going to do? Arrest 			me?	Quark holds the PADD up and starts reading aloud.					QUARK 			"He walked toward her, the wooden 			deck heaving to and fro beneath 			his booted feet. Her hands moved 			to the broach at her throat. She 			unclasped it and the cloak fell 			from her shoulders, her wet 			skin glistening in the moonlight. 			Lightning flashed and heaven's 			thunder roared in rhythm with the 			beating of their hearts."					ODO			All right. Enough.	Odo snatches the PADD back from Quark.					QUARK 			Odo, I take it all back. You're 			obviously a lot more complicated 			than I thought.				(looking for an angle)			If you like that kind of thing I 			might be willing to sell you my 			first edition of "Vulcan Love 			Slave."					ODO			This is work, not recreation.				(can see Quark doesn't				buy it)			Books like this give me insight			into the criminal mind. It's a			well known fact that a sizable			percentage of homicides are			motivated by romantic obsession.					QUARK 			Well, no one gets killed in 			"Vulcan Love Slave," but it's 			still a hell of a read.	Odo smiles to himself.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE      10.5    CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO			Give it up, Quark. You can bait 			me, annoy me, question my very 			existence, but in the end, we both 			know I've won. Because when all 			is said and done, I'll be heading 			back to D.S. Nine and you'll be 			spending the rest of your life in 			a Federation penal colony.					QUARK 				(defiant)			I'm not there yet. 				(a beat)			Look, Odo. Give me a chance. At 			least tell me what the charges 			are.					ODO			I'm afraid I can't do that. This 			is a high-security investigation 			and I'm not allowed to discuss the 			specifics with anyone.				(a beat)			Now, if you don't mind... I have 			some reading to do.	Quark decides not to press his luck and Odo looks back 	to his PADD.6    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.7    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	NOG, dressed in his cadet's uniform, stands at 	attention in front of Sisko's desk.					NOG 			Cadet Nog reporting for duty, sir.					SISKO			At ease, cadet. Have a seat.					NOG			Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.	Nog sits. The young Ferengi's had a definite change in 	attitude since joining the academy. He's now a 	serious, ramrod-straight Starfleet officer-in-training.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE         7    CONTINUED:					SISKO			You know, I remember when I did my 			sophomore year field study. 			Starbase One Thirty-seven. I was 			a little apprehensive when I got 			there. But it turned out to be 			one of the best experiences of my 			life.					NOG 			Yes, sir.					SISKO			The key to field study is simple. 			Keep your eyes and ears open, 			follow orders and try not to get 			in the way.					NOG 			Yes, sir. Very good, sir. I 			won't let you down.	That concludes Sisko's official business. He relaxes, 	signaling Nog to do likewise. But Nog remains poised 	for action.					SISKO			Now, on a personal note... I'd 			like to say how glad I am that you 			and Jake are going to be roommates.					NOG 			Yes, sir.					SISKO			I'm sure the two of you are going 			to have a lot of fun together.					NOG 			Yes, sir. Time permitting, sir. 			I mean, if I'm not too busy. 			After all, I am here to work.	There's a beat and for the first time Nog seems to 	relax a little bit and he leans in closer to Sisko's 	desk, speaking confidentially.					NOG 			Don't worry, sir. I'll look after 			him for you. Set a good example. 			Keep him out of trouble.	Sisko's not sure how to take this. He's surprised at 	Nog's serious, mature and somewhat uptight attitude.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE      12.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			You inspire me with confidence, 			cadet. Dismissed.	Nog stands, does an about-face and EXITS. Sisko 	watches him go, bemused.7A   INT. OPS	Nog walks out of Sisko's office. KIRA is on duty in 	Ops.					KIRA			How'd it go?					NOG				(proudly)			I inspire him.					KIRA			Congratulations. Now don't let 			him down.					NOG 			You can count on me, sir.	Nog EXITS. Kira shakes her head.8    INT. JAKE AND NOG'S QUARTERS	Jake and Nog ENTER the darkened quarters.					JAKE 			Lights.	The lights come up. Jake's still-packed luggage is 	piled in the center of the room.					JAKE 			So what do you think?					NOG			I think I've died and gone to the 			Divine Treasury. After living in 			cadet barracks for the past year, 			this is going to be paradise.					JAKE 			I know exactly what you mean. 			We're on our own, with no one to 			tell us what to do.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE     12A.8    CONTINUED:	Jake wanders around the room looking through doorways 	at the unseen bedrooms. Nog runs a finger across the 	windowsill and looks at it with disapproval.					NOG 			Before we unpack, we should call 			maintenance to clean this place.					JAKE			They were here yesterday.	Nog shows Jake his finger.					NOG				(resigned)			If you want something done right, 			you have to do it yourself.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE         8    CONTINUED:	(2)					NOG  (Cont'd)			I'll do the cleaning on the odd-			numbered days, and you'll do it on 			the even ones.					JAKE 			We're going to clean every day?					NOG				(smiling)			No. Just the odd and even ones.	Nog looks around the room.					NOG 			I'd better start bringing in my 			things. I don't want to be up too 			late unpacking.					JAKE 			So what do you feel like doing 			tonight? Dom-jot... 			Holosuites... ?	Nog is tempted, but he knows he can't.					NOG 			I wish I could. But once we eat 			and unpack, it'll be time for bed. 			Lights out at twenty-two hundred.					JAKE 			I haven't gone to bed that early 			since I was twelve.					NOG 			Go to sleep whenever you want. 			But don't forget, we're hitting 			the gym at oh-four-thirty.					JAKE				(can't believe his ears)			The gym?	Nog looks at Jake appraisingly.					NOG 			Muscles, Jake.				(waggles Jake's arm)			You know, those things that're 			supposed to go between your bones 			and your skin?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE      14.8    CONTINUED:	(3)					JAKE			I've heard of them.					NOG			Good. Because by the time I'm			done with you, you're going to			have some of your very own.	Nog EXITS. Jake looks down at his arm, makes a muscle, 	and isn't impressed with what he sees. But after a 	second, he shakes his head dismissively. He's not 	buying what Nog's selling.9    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	The Runabout at Warp.10   INT. RUNABOUT	It's four days later but it seems more like four years 	to the runabout's two passengers. Quark is seated at 	a back chair, tossing his playing cards across the 	cabin, trying to land them on the opposite chair. He 	looks grumpy and bored.	Odo ENTERS from the back, eating a bowl of soup. He 	sits down at the console, totally ignoring Quark. He 	sips his soup quietly while keeping one eye on the 	controls.	Quark sits there for a beat and his tossing becomes 	more and more impatient. Finally he can't stand it 	anymore and stops.					QUARK			You're doing it again.					ODO			Doing what?					QUARK			Smacking your lips.					ODO			No I'm not.	Odo swallows a spoonful of soup. And though the 	audience should not hear anything, there is a 	perceptible movement of his lips.					QUARK			There. Don't you hear that?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE      15.10   CONTINUED:					ODO			For the last four days, all I've 			heard is you complaining.					QUARK			This whole runabout is alive with 			annoying little noises. Listen.					ODO			To what?					QUARK			That buzzing sound.					ODO			I don't hear a thing.	But Odo's denial only fuels Quark's indignation.					QUARK			It started over an hour ago.					ODO			If you don't like the noises in 			here, why don't you go into the 			back?					QUARK			Because it's even colder back 			there than it is up here.	Quark moves towards a panel in the wall.					ODO			Quark, leave the temperature 			controls alone.					QUARK			I will.				(a beat)			As soon as I get it right.	Quark works the environmental controls.					QUARK			There it is again.					ODO			What?					QUARK			That buzzing noise.

He 	gets up and joins Quark by the panel.					ODO			It's probably a defective anodyne			circuit.					QUARK			Defective anodyne circuits make a			kind of... hissing sound.				(authoritatively)			This is a buzz.				(a beat)			We've got to open up the panel.	Odo looks doubtfully at Quark.					ODO			If this is some kind of convoluted			plot to escape...					QUARK			Stop being so suspicious.       DEEP SPACE NINE- "The Ascent" - REV. 10/14/96 - ACT ONE      17.10   CONTINUED:	(3)	Something attracts Quark's attention.					QUARK			That's odd.
