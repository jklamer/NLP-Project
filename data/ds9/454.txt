REPLIMAT	where ODO is standing by a table waiting for KIRA to get a 	CUP of coffee from the replicator.  SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.	She turns away from the machine, mug in hand, and they sit.  	She lifts the mug up to her lips and blows on the liquid to 	cool it, then takes a small sip -- from her reaction we can 	tell it's hot, and she blows on it again before taking another 	sip.  Odo watches, intrigued.					ODO			Too hot?					KIRA			A little.					ODO			Why don't you specify a lower 			temperature?					KIRA			No, no... coffee should be too hot 			to drink right away...	This makes no sense to him.					ODO			Why?					KIRA			It... slows down the experience... 			gives you time to savor the taste.	Odo nods, fascinated.					ODO			Ah, yes... taste.	Kira has a sense Odo may not be comfortable with what she 	wants to ask him, but she decides to go ahead anyway.             DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - 09/20/94 - TEASER              2.1    CONTINUED:					KIRA			Odo, I know you don't need to eat... 			but have you ever tried to anyway?	Odo takes a beat, as if this were a slightly uncomfortable 	topic.					ODO			Once... not long after I was first 			able to assume humanoid form.	Kira waits for him to continue; when he doesn't.					KIRA			And?					ODO			Since I don't have taste buds, it 			was very unsatisfying... not to 			mention messy.					KIRA			Messy?					ODO			I'd rather not talk about it.	Before Kira has time to continue, an alien male, TIRON, 	approaches their table.  He's tall and nattily dressed, with 	jeweled RINGS on more than one of his fingers.  While he 	comports himself with what he probably believes is a certain 	suaveness, he comes off a bit arrogant.           DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/21/94 - TEASER           3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					TIRON			Major Kira, how nice to see you again.  			KIRA				(unenthused)			Tiron...					TIRON			You left Quark's last night just 			when I was about to buy everyone 			another round.  I was devastated 			that you didn't say good-bye... and 			we were having such a pleasant 			conversation.					KIRA			As I recall you were doing most of 			the talking.	Tiron smoothly rephrases her comment.					TIRON			In that case you have me at a 			disadvantage... you know all about 			me, but I know next to nothing about 			you.	He smiles gamely.  Odo feels like an intruder.					ODO			Perhaps I should be going.	He starts to stand, but Kira reaches and grabs his arm, 	desperate to keep him there.					KIRA			No, stay.				(all smiles)			This is Tiron, a business associate 			of Quark's.				(to Tiron)			And this is Odo, my... lover.	Odo freezes, unsure what to do.  Kira reaches and takes his 	hand.  Tiron is not at all happy to hear she's involved.					TIRON				(to Odo)			Well... you're a very lucky man.	Odo doesn't know what to say, so Kira intercedes.             DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - 09/20/94 - TEASER              4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					KIRA			And I'm a lucky woman.	She looks to Odo for confirmation.					ODO				(uncomfortable)			Yes... we're... both very lucky.	Tiron's tone conveys the fact that he doesn't think Odo is 	good enough for Kira.					TIRON			And you make a most... interesting 			couple.				(to Odo)			So, Mister Odo... what is it that 			you do?					ODO			I'm chief of security here on the 			station.					TIRON			A station this size, it must be a 			very challenging job...				(a false smile)			I hope you're well compensated... ?					KIRA			Oh, that doesn't matter... all we 			need is each other.  Isn't that right, 			sweetheart?	She squeezes Odo's hand.					ODO			Yes... sweetheart...					KIRA				(to Tiron, all smiles)			You see?  Money isn't everything.					TIRON			No... but it can buy you everything.				(smiles)			Well, I'm afraid I have to be going.  			Good-bye.	And with a nod he takes his leave, EXITS to the Promenade.           DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/22/94 - TEASER           5.1    CONTINUED:	(4)					KIRA				(sotto)			And good riddance...				(to Odo)			Thank you, Odo.  I wish you'd been 			around last night.	Kira lets go of his hand and takes a last sip of coffee.					KIRA			I better get back to Ops.	Odo acknowledges with a nod and Kira stands to go.					KIRA			See you later...				(joking)			-- dear.	She moves away... off Odo's face as he looks down at his 	hand, still palm up on the table... he hasn't moved it since 	Kira let go...2    EXT.

SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.	BASHIR ENTERS from the corridor and approaches Sisko; he 	seems excited about something.					BASHIR			I've run a preliminary analysis of 			our sensor sweeps... the second planet 			in the Kylata system is definitely M-			class.           DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/22/94 - TEASER           6.3    CONTINUED:					DAX			I wish we'd had time to beam down to 			the surface for a closer look.					O'BRIEN				(lightly)			I'd hate to have run into a Jem'Hadar 			patrol while we were down there 			picking flowers.					SISKO				(smiles)			Fortunately there's been no sign of 			Dominion activity in this sector.					BASHIR			Let's hope it stays that way.	Suddenly Dax reacts to something on her console.					DAX			I'm picking up very unusual 			gravimetric distortions in the Trialus 			system.					SISKO			Any idea what's causing them?					DAX			It's hard to tell at this range.					SISKO			Let's take a closer look.	Dax works her controls.4    EXT.

The 			beam is coming from a settlement on 			the southern hemisphere.  I'm reading 			approximately thirty humanoid 			inhabitants.				(continuing to work 				console)			They seem to be the only humanoids 			on the planet.          DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/22/94 - ACT ONE           9.6    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(off console)			They're hailing us.					SISKO			Open a channel.				(beat)			This is Commander Benjamin Sisko of 			the Federation Starbase Deep Space 			Nine.	After a beat, the VIEWSCREEN engages.  A humanoid woman of 	about fifty APPEARS on the Viewscreen, SELTIN.  She is dressed 	in simple clothing, and is standing in front of a simple one-	wall set.	She seems to study our people's faces for a beat before saying 	anything; her face is kind, with an open countenance.					SELTIN			I am Seltin Rakal of Meridian.	Sisko nods a greeting.					SISKO			We were studying this star system 			when your planet appeared.					SELTIN				(smiles gently)			I expect it must have come as 			something of a surprise.					SISKO			You could say that.  It seemed to 			come out of nowhere.					SELTIN			Not nowhere, Commander -- it came 			from a dimension that intersects 			with this one.	She sees the intrigued looks on our people's faces.					SELTIN			I could explain it in greater detail, 			if you're interested.  We were just 			about to sit down for First Meal -- 			why don't you join us?          DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/22/94 - ACT ONE          9A.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			We'd like that.					SISKO				(smiling)			I just need to know your planet isn't 			going to disappear in the middle of 			dessert.					SELTIN				(smiles)			Don't worry... we'll be here for 			a while.          DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/27/94 - ACT ONE          10.6    CONTINUED:	(3)	Sisko acknowledges... off this moment...7    EXT. VILLAGE COMMONS - DAY	Where a long table is set out for a feast.  Our people sit 	near the table's head, and the rest of the Meridians, 	representing a wide range of ages, sit along its perimeter.  	They're checking out our people, casting them curious looks 	and friendly smiles.	Sisko is seated next to Seltin, Dax next to DERAL, a male 	Meridian of about forty.  Bashir and O'Brien sit nearby.	From the head of the table, Seltin addresses the group, which 	falls silent.					SELTIN			It's good to be together again around 			this table after so long.  What's 			more, we're fortunate to have visitors 			to share First Meal with us.	There are nods and murmurs of assent, then everyone begins 	to eat with great relish... they eat slowly, with great 	deliberation, as if savoring every moment.7A   ON DAX AND DERAL	Dax is taking a sip of something when she notices Deral 	looking at her.  She meets his eyes.					DERAL			I was just admiring your...				(he gestures to her 				temple)			-- markings.  Are they decorative?					DAX			No...				(she gestures to his)			-- are yours?					DERAL			No...	They share a smile.					DERAL			If you don't mind my asking, how far 			down do they go?          DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/27/94 - ACT ONE          11.7A   CONTINUED:					DAX			All the way...	Deral nods thoughtfully.

We exist as pure 			consciousness...	Our people take this in, fascinated.					SISKO			And Meridian?					SELTIN			It becomes non-corporeal as well, 			but when we return to this dimension, 			everything is just as we left it.  			The buildings, the trees... even our 			bodies.	Our people are genuinely intrigued by what they're hearing.					O'BRIEN			Are you saying that when you return 			here, it's as if no time has passed?					SELTIN			Yes... we only age when we're in 			corporeal form.					BASHIR				(smiles)			Sounds like this other dimension has 			its advantages...	Deral turns to Dax.					DERAL			Yes... but we always look forward to 			this existence... and its many 			pleasures.	Dax is trying to get a scoop out a spoonful from the core of 	a meaty looking FRUIT.          DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/27/94 - ACT ONE          13.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					DERAL			Here, let me help you with that...	He takes the fruit and deftly scoops away the meat.					DERAL			The trick is to remove the pulp and 			eat the thin layer inside the rind.	He holds out a spoonful for her.					DERAL			Here, try some...	Dax tastes it -- and clearly finds it to her liking.					DAX			It's delicious...					DERAL				(smiles)			Especially if you've been looking 			forward to it for sixty years...					DAX			Sixty years?					O'BRIEN			That's a long time between meals...	Dax notices that Deral is watching her as she tries to scoop 	out another fruit.					DAX			How am I doing... ?					DERAL			Much better...	They share a smile, and we get the feeling their conversation 	will continue...          DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/27/94 - ACT ONE          14.10   EXT.

I found it dull -- 			boring, boring, boring.					QUARK			I'm sorry to hear that, but if you're 			asking for a refund, forget it -- 			the contract specifically says that 			satisfaction is not guaranteed.				(beat)			But for a valued customer such as 			yourself, I'll make an exception and 			let you try a different program.  No 			extra charge.	Quark takes out a PADD, studies the screen.					QUARK			Let's see... something a little more 			unique.				(finding it)			Ah, I have just the thing.  "A picnic 			with the pleasure Goddess of Rixx."  			I can even provide real food -- for 			a small fee, of course.					TIRON			I don't like picnics, Quark... and 			the food here is terrible.          DEEP SPACE: "Meridian" - REV. 09/21/94 - ACT ONE          16.11   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			All right, forget the food.

It may take some time, 			but if it exists I'll get it.					TIRON			That's just it, Quark, the program I 			want doesn't exist.  Not yet, anyway.					QUARK			A custom program?  It'll be expensive.	Tiron slaps an entire BAR of latinum on the countertop.					QUARK			For that kind of money you could 			move into a holosuite.  Now, what is 			it you want?	Tiron leans in for emphasis.					TIRON			I want Major Kira.					QUARK			Kira?  What are you going to do with 			Kira in a holosuite?				(thinking better of 				it)			No, don't tell me.  I don't want to 			know.					TIRON			Can you do it, Quark?					QUARK			It's not going to be easy.  I'd have 			to get her into a holosuite and record 			her image.
