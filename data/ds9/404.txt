PROMENADE REPLIMAT	DOCTOR JULIAN BASHIR sits enjoying a tea-like beverage, 	reading a medical journal PADD... as the large, ever-pleasant 	Cardassian, GARAK, interposes himself between Bashir and the 	latter's view, with:					GARAK			It's Doctor Bashir, isn't it?  Of 			course it is.  May I introduce myself?	Bashir looks up and reacts... and if this were a poker game... 	and in a way, it is... Bashir would be at a severe 	disadvantage.  His heart's just started thumping - he's been 	alerted about this man, never thought he'd come face to face 	with him like this...					BASHIR			Uh... yes, yes of course.					GARAK				(sits)			My name is Garak; Cardassian by birth, 			obviously.  The only one of us left 			on the station, as a matter of fact.  			So I do appreciate making new friends 			when I can.  You are new to the 			station, I believe.					BASHIR				(obviously cautious)			I am, yes...	A beat as Garak studies him, smiles, waits as a good poker 	player waits.  Finally, Bashir fills the silence...            DEEP SPACE: "Past Prologue" 10/05/92 - TEASER            2.2    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Though... though I understand you've 			been here quite a while.					GARAK			Ah, you know of me, then.	Bashir avoids replying.					BASHIR			Would you care for some of this 			Tarkalean tea?  It's very good.					GARAK			What a thoughtful young man.  How 			nice that we've met.	Bashir tries tentatively to take the offensive...					BASHIR			You know... there are some who say 			you've remained on DS Nine as the... 			eyes and ears of your fellow 			Cardassians...					GARAK			You don't say.  Doctor, you're not 			intimating that I'm considered some 			sort of... "spy," are you?					BASHIR				(too quick)			I wouldn't know, Sir.					GARAK			Ah!  An open mind.  The essence of 			intellect.				(rising)			As you may also know, I have a 			clothing shop nearby, so... If you 			should require any apparel, or merely 			wish, as I do, for a bit of enjoyable 			company now and then, I'm at your 			disposal, Doctor.					BASHIR			You're very kind, Mister Garak.            DEEP SPACE: "Past Prologue" 10/05/92 - TEASER            3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK			Oh, it's just Garak.  Plain, simple 			Garak.  And now, good day to you, 			Doctor...

Federation medical 			secrets...				(turning to Sisko)			... rest assured they're safe with 			me, Commander.					SISKO			I'm sure they are, Doctor Bashir...					BASHIR			In fact... Chief O'Brien, I think 			you should place a monitoring device 			on me...	O'Brien gives him a long, silent look... it's more telling 	about O'Brien's attitude toward him than any line of dialogue 	could be...					BASHIR				(off the look)			Just in case... he is... up to 			something.					SISKO			I don't think that'll be necessary, 			Doctor... just be very cautious when 			you're around...					KIRA				(interrupting)			Commander?  We've got a small craft 			taking evasive action... Cardassian 			war vessel in pursuit.					SISKO			On screen.3A   INCLUDING MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	We see a small Bajoran scout ship... being pursued by a 	Cardassian war vessel.

Even the Bajorans 			would not grant his kind asylum...	Sisko raises an eyebrow, glances at Kira...					GUL DANAR				(continuing)			He has committed heinous crimes 			against the Cardassian people... and 			I demand you release him to our 			custody... if you do not...					SISKO				(interrupting)			I'll investigate the matter 			immediately.  In the interim, if 			you'd care to dock your vessel, I'll 			be glad to hear your explanation for 			having violated Bajoran space and 			threatened a Federation facility.					GUL DANAR				(beat)			We have made no threat to your 			facility.					SISKO				(small smile)			I stand corrected.

PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS	as they exit the Turbolift...					KIRA			Look, I know Tahna...					SISKO			Is he Kohn-Ma?					KIRA				(beat)			Yes... but...	Sisko stops...           DEEP SPACE: "Past Prologue" 10/05/92 - ACT ONE           10.9B   CONTINUED:					SISKO			I suggest you get your priorities 			straight, Major... because I have no 			room for divided loyalties in this 			command.  And I won't have a Kohn-Ma 			terrorist using this station as a 			protective shield for continuing 			violence.	Undaunted, she's right back in his face...					KIRA			My priorities are straight, Commander; 			let's not be confused here -- my 			loyalties are to Bajor.  And Bajor 			needs men like Tahna Los.					SISKO			His war with the Cardassians 			apparently isn't over...					KIRA			If Bajor is ever going to rebuild a 			strong and independent society, it 			will require the repatriation of 			splinter groups like the Kohn-Ma... 			you have, we have, an opportunity 			here, Commander... I hope you don't 			miss it.	She moves away from his toward the infirmary... a beat as he 	reacts - she always gives him something to think about.10   INT.

Tahna, 	on the biobed, is just beginning to regain consciousness.  	Kira as already reached his bedside.					KIRA			How is he?					BASHIR			Second degree burns, lacerations, a 			minor concussion...

I 			have a few questions for you... if 			you're up to answering them...					KIRA				(showing her loyalties)			Commander Sisko hasn't decided whether 			to grant you asylum yet, Tahna.					SISKO				(controlled bristling)			Major, perhaps I should conduct this 			alone...					TAHNA				(reacts to the rank)			Major?           DEEP SPACE: "Past Prologue" 10/05/92 - ACT ONE           12.12   CONTINUED:					KIRA			I'm the liaison officer to the 			Federation here.				(beat, toward Sisko)			Still fighting for Bajor in my own 			way.				(to Tahna)			I'll stop back later.	She nods, angry, at Sisko... and exits.					TAHNA			What do you need to know, Commander?					SISKO			For starters, why were they chasing 			you?					TAHNA				(smiles in pain)			You really want to hear the story of 			my life?					SISKO			I assume as a member of the Kohn-Ma 			that you've committed serious acts 			against them...					TAHNA			Any one of a hundred that would lead 			to a Cardassian death sentence.					SISKO			Any of them since their withdrawal 			from Bajor?					TAHNA				(beat)			Frankly, yes.					SISKO			Why would you continue the violence 			against them now?					TAHNA				(sincere)			To be honest, I'm not sure anymore, 			Commander...           DEEP SPACE: "Past Prologue" 10/05/92 - ACT ONE          12A.12   CONTINUED:	(2)					TAHNA (Cont'd)				(beat)			We say we're punishing them for crimes 			committed against us for half a 			century... but...

SISKO'S OFFICE	Sisko Rises as Gul Danar ENTERS.  The adversarial nature of 	this meeting is belied by the mutual civility.					GUL DANAR			If you require all vessels to endure 			such lengthy docking procedures, 			Commander, you're going to have a 			lot of impatient traffic out there.					SISKO			I apologize... we're still trying to 			repair all the damage your forces 			did before they left... it does create 			unreasonable delays.					GUL DANAR			I accept your apology, not your 			explanation.  What about Tahna Los?					SISKO			Well, we've got a problem.					GUL DANAR			A diplomatic insult to the Cardassian 			people would be a problem... 			delivering a wanted criminal to us 			would not be...					SISKO				(seeking a reasonable 				solution)			Danar, in war, both sides commit 			atrocities...					GUL DANAR			My "request" for this man is made in 			connection with an extremely sensitive 			issue.
