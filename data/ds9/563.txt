QUARK'S	The usual crowd. Several officers are gathered	around one of Quark's side tables. Included in the	group are KIRA, O'BRIEN, BASHIR, EZRI and a new	lieutenant (j.g.) HECTOR ILARIO. Ilario is a	likeable young man who's just arrived on the	station. He's handsome, excited to have completed	his first mission and a bit anxious to be accepted	as one of the guys.					BASHIR				(raising his glass)			To Lieutenant Hector Ilario...			living proof that Starfleet			Academy still produces the finest			pilots in the galaxy.					O'BRIEN			Here, here.	Everyone goes to drink, but Bashir holds up a	staying hand --					BASHIR			Hold on, I'm not finished yet.					KIRA			Don't spoil it, Julian. That was			exactly what a toast should be --			short and to the point.					ILARIO				(tongue-in-cheek)			I wouldn't mind hearing a little			more...					EZRI			Now, now -- modesty above all.					BASHIR			This is no time for modesty.				(re: Ilario)			This man... this youth... this			mere pup still wet behind the			ears --      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER      2.1    CONTINUED:					ILARIO				(interrupting)			I'm twenty-two.					BASHIR			I'm speaking metaphorically.			This inspired cherub masterfully			piloted the Defiant into battle			against a half-dozen Jem'Hadar			attack ships. And when the smoke			cleared, only one ship remained			intact. And that ship, ladies and			gentlemen, was the U.S.S. Defiant.					O'BRIEN				(patting him on the back)			The kid's a born helmsman.					BASHIR			And so say all of us.	And with that they finally CLINK glasses and drink.					ILARIO			Thanks. I'm just glad to be			here.					O'BRIEN			There's no better posting in the			fleet.					BASHIR			Anything you need -- anything at			all -- just ask.					ILARIO			Well, there is one thing...					O'BRIEN			Name it.					ILARIO				(to O'Brien and Bashir)			The next time you two go to the			holosuite... I'd like to come			along.	O'Brien and Bashir exchange a silent look, then turn	back to Ilario.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER      3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN			Sorry.					BASHIR			Impossible.					O'BRIEN			Out of the question.					BASHIR			Can't be done.	Ilario looks a little disappointed.					KIRA				(to Ilario)			Don't take it personally.				(re: O'Brien and				Bashir)			They take their leisure activity			very seriously.					BASHIR			It's a great stress reliever.					O'BRIEN			I recommend it highly.					BASHIR			Just not with us.					O'BRIEN			A holosuite visit is a very			personal experience.					BASHIR				(confidentially, to				Ilario, re: O'Brien)			He's very particular about who			sees him in a coonskin cap. You			understand...					ILARIO			I suppose...	Just then, QUARK approaches.					QUARK				(to O'Brien and				Bashir)			Gentlemen, your holosuite is			ready.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER      4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR			Terrific.				(to Ilario)			Now anything else you need...					O'BRIEN			... you just let us know.	And with that, O'Brien and Bashir EXIT up the stairs	to the holosuites.2    ANGLE ON KIRA, EZRI AND ILARIO	watching them leave.					ILARIO			Have you ever gone to the			holosuite with them?					KIRA			Me? Never.					EZRI				(agreeing with Kira)			I know when I'm not wanted.3    INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR	Ezri and Ilario are walking back to their quarters.	Ilario has had too much to drink, but he's trying	not to show it.					ILARIO			I never had real Saurian brandy			before. It's Captain Sisko's			favorite.					EZRI			Kinda sneaks up on you, doesn't			it?	They pass a doorway and suddenly Ilario stops.					ILARIO			Speaking of sneaking up on you...	Ilario then takes two steps backward.					ILARIO			Here we are. Home sweet home.	Ilario hits the doorpad. The door opens.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER      5.4    INT. ILARIO'S QUARTERS	Ilario manages to make it into his quarters. He's	starting to feel a little better.					EZRI			Are you okay? You want some			raktajino?					ILARIO			I'm fine.	Ilario walks over to a picture on the wall.					ILARIO				(to the picture)			I wish they could've been there.5    CLOSE ON THE PICTURE	to see Ilario and THREE OTHER ACADEMY CLASSMATES,	they're arms around each other, LAUGHING.					ILARIO (O.S.)			See me fly the Defiant into			battle...6    ON ILARIO	staring at the picture with a smile.					ILARIO			... it was incredible...					EZRI			I should be going. Make sure you			get some sleep.					ILARIO			You know something, lieutenant...			you're very beautiful.					EZRI			And you're very drunk.					ILARIO			True enough. But in the morning,			I'll be sober and you'll still be			beautiful.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER      6.7    CLOSE ON EZRI	She smiles, then she turns to go.					EZRI			Good night, Ilario.					ILARIO			Good night, lieutenant.8    EXT.

I'm up.	And with that she drags herself out of bed.10   INT. EZRI'S QUARTERS - LIVING ROOM	Ezri, now dressed in her Starfleet uniform, is	standing before her replicator.					EZRI			Fanalian tea. Hot.	A beat later, Ezri takes the mug out of the	replicator and goes to the door --11   ANGLE ON THE DOOR	as it OPENS to reveal FOUR SECURITY GUARDS racing	down the hall, phasers drawn.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - TEASER      7.12   ON EZRI	surprised by the sight.13   INT.

Bashir	is still examining the body, while Ezri stands off	to the side, almost forgotten.					ODO			... he was killed by what appears			to have been some kind of			chemically propelled projectile			weapon.					SISKO				(surprised)			A gun?					ODO				(nodding)			Doctor Bashir recovered a single			tritanium "bullet" from Ilario's			chest.					BASHIR			He was shot through the heart.	Bashir hands Sisko a small vial with a single metal	bullet in it.					O'BRIEN				(re: the bullet)			You don't see one of those every			day.					ODO				(nodding)			No one uses projectile weapons			anymore.					SISKO				(thoughtful, re: the				bullet)			You said this is tritanium,			right?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE      9.15   CONTINUED:					ODO			That's correct.					SISKO			Chief, did you ever hear of the			TR-one-one-six rifle?					O'BRIEN				(nodding)			It was a prototype. Developed by			Starfleet Security to operate in			energy dampening fields or			radiogenic environments.					SISKO			That's right. Anywhere that a			normal phaser would be useless.			If I'm not mistaken, the TR-one-			one-six fired a chemically 			propelled tritanium "bullet."					ODO			You said it was a prototype -- 			were they ever mass-produced?					O'BRIEN			No, Starfleet abandoned the TR-			one-one-six in favor of			regenerative phasers.					SISKO			That doesn't mean our killer			couldn't have gotten hold of the			rifle's replication patterns.					O'BRIEN			But only Starfleet officers have			access to those files.					SISKO			Disturbing thought, isn't it?					BASHIR			Starfleet officers don't go			around murdering one another.					ODO				(correcting)			Not usually, anyway.					O'BRIEN				(off his tricorder)			That's odd...     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE     9A.15   CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)			... according to these readings,			the "bullet" only traveled eight			or nine centimeters.					SISKO			The killer must've fired at point			blank range.					O'BRIEN			I don't think so...				(looking at Ilario's body)			... there are no "powder burns" on			the body.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE     10.15   CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR			What are "powder burns?"					ODO			At close range, chemically 			propelled weapons leave residual			combustion products on the			victim's clothing or skin.					SISKO				(to O'Brien)			How did you know that?					O'BRIEN			I read twentieth century crime			novels... Mike Hammer, Raymond			Chandler, that kind of thing...	Sisko looks to Odo, thereby asking the same	question.					ODO			So do I.					SISKO				(back to business)			So if the killer fired at close			range, why aren't there any			"powder burns?"					O'BRIEN			I don't know...					ODO				(off Sisko's look)			But we'll find out.					EZRI				(to Julian)			What was the time of death?					BASHIR			Oh-three seventeen.					EZRI			That's only ten minutes after I			left him.	Everyone had all but forgotten about Ezri.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE    10A.15     CONTINUED:	(4)					SISKO			Was he alone?					EZRI			I didn't see anyone, but I wasn't			here very long.	Sisko paces the room.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Field of Fire" - REV. 11/23/98 - ACT ONE     11.15   CONTINUED:	(5)					SISKO			What do we know about Ilario?			Outside of his service record...					ODO			Not a great deal. He's only been			on the station ten days.					EZRI			As far as I could tell, he was			intelligent, dedicated and eager			to please. Everyone liked him.					SISKO			Not everyone.				(to Odo)			I want to know everything there			is to know about him -- who his			friends were, if he'd made any			enemies. I also want increased			security throughout the station.					ODO			Yes, sir.					SISKO			And Constable --					ODO				(finishing the				thought for him)			-- you want whoever did this			caught.
