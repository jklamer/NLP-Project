You're not going to have			any customers.					JOSEPH			I've got plenty of customers.			Just look outside.Jake looks out the window.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - TEASER      2.1    CONTINUED:					JAKE			All I see are security officers.					JOSEPH			And I bet not one of them's had a			good meal in four days.

SISKO'S TEMPORARY OFFICE - DAY	SISKO is at his desk, studying reports on his table	monitor. ODO is pacing around the room, studying a	PADD.					SISKO			I don't like this. The more I			read Starfleet's reports on the			sabotage of the power relays, the			more unanswered questions I have.				(lays it out)			How were the changelings able to			infiltrate the Division of			Planetary operations? Where did			they get the codes for the			Division's computer control			network? And how did they manage			to overload every power relay on			Earth at the same time?	Odo nods. He's in total agreement. But his attention	is drawn to something he sees on the PADD.					ODO			Captain, have you ever heard of a			group called Red Squad?					SISKO			They're an elite team of Starfleet			cadets. According to Nog, every			student at the Academy wants to be			a part of it.	Odo, shakes his head. He figures he was making	something out of nothing.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - TEASER        3    CONTINUED:					ODO			That explains it.					SISKO			Explains what?					ODO			According to this transporter log,			a group called Red Squad was			beamed back to Starfleet Academy			twenty-six minutes after the State			of Emergency was declared.	This gets Sisko's interest.					SISKO			That's strange. During the			blackout, Starfleet mobilized			hundreds of units. Why would they			have demobilized Red Squad?					ODO			That's why I brought it up. But			if they're cadets... I suppose			Starfleet wanted to get them out			of harm's way.	But something about Odo's theory doesn't ring true to	Sisko. He looks up something on his own computer.					SISKO			If that's true, then how do you			explain this...				(finds what he was				looking for)			Three hours later Starfleet			Command issued an order assigning			the entire Corps of Cadets to			field duty.					ODO			Which means they weren't bringing			Red Squad home to protect them.					SISKO			So the question is... why			demobilize Red Squad only to			mobilize them again three hours			later?	Sisko and Odo share a look. Neither man has an answer.									CUT TO:      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - TEASER     3A.4    INT.

Sisko looks up at Odo, who	is standing behind the monitor so he will not be	included in the picture sent to Commandant. They lock	eyes for a beat. The Commandant's behavior seems a	little strange. Just then, the monitor reactivates and	the Commandant comes back on line.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - TEASER     4A.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					ACADEMY COMMANDANT				(on monitor)			Sorry, Captain. But I think			you'll agree, this is a time for			caution.					SISKO				(playing along)			Absolutely.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - TEASER      5.4    CONTINUED:	(3)					ACADEMY COMMANDANT				(on monitor)			Does Admiral Leyton know about			this report?					SISKO			He hasn't mentioned it to me.	The Commandant looks relieved.					ACADEMY COMMANDANT				(on monitor)			Listen to me, Captain. I want			that record erased before anyone			else sees it. Is that understood?					SISKO			I'll take care of it immediately.					ACADEMY COMMANDANT				(grateful, on monitor)			Good. That report could cause us			a lot of trouble. I'm glad you			spotted it.	Sisko still isn't sure exactly what they're talking	about, but he's playing along to see what he can learn.					SISKO			So am I. I'd hate to see the			members of Red Squad get into any			trouble.					ACADEMY COMMANDANT				(on monitor)			They're fine young men and women.			When Leyton talked to me about			using them, I thought it was a			mistake... but I have to admit,			they performed their mission			admirably.				(a beat)			I appreciate your call, Captain.			I'm in your debt.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/9S- TEASER       6.4    CONTINUED:	(4)	The Commandant ends his transmission.5    NEW ANGLE	As Sisko sits back in his chair, deeply concerned about	this latest development.					ODO			Well, that certainly raised more			questions than it answered.	And as we push in on Sisko's troubled face, we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT ONE      7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)6    INT.

It doesn't change.					JOSEPH				(with humor)			What did I tell you? As human as			I ever was.	The Security Officer gives him a good-natured pat on	the back and then goes to test some of the other	customers.7    NEW ANGLE	As Joseph turns to a corner table where Sisko sits.					SISKO			You're looking pretty jovial			today.	Joseph sits down at the table next to Sisko.					JOSEPH			Is there a problem with that?					SISKO			It's just... you weren't so happy			about being tested a few days ago.					JOSEPH			That was before the changelings			sabotaged the power grid.	Joseph waits for Sisko to react positively, but when he	doesn't, Joseph frowns.					JOSEPH			I don't understand you. When I			didn't want to be tested you made			it an issue, and now that I'm			cooperating you're still not			satisfied.					SISKO			It's not you, Dad.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT ONE      8.7    CONTINUED:					JOSEPH			Then what is it?					SISKO			I'm not sure.				(re: the Security Officers)			They look tired.					JOSEPH			I'm not surprised. Now that the			blood screenings have been widened			to include the general public,			they've been working around the			clock.	Joseph looks at his son, who's looking pretty run down	himself.					JOSEPH				(pointedly)			Besides, they're not the only ones			who look tired.	Just then...8    NEW ANGLE	As NOG ENTERS, wearing his cadet's uniform.					NOG			Captain, Jake said you wanted to			see me.					SISKO			Yes, I do.	Joseph can tell this is business. He excuses himself.					JOSEPH			You two talk.				(to Nog)			I'll go chill some			tube grubs.	Joseph EXITS.9    CLOSE ON SISKO, AND NOG	Now seated alone in a quiet corner.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT ONE      9.9    CONTINUED:					NOG			What can I do for you, sir?					SISKO			It's about Red Squad.					NOG				(excited)			Red Squad? Did you get me in?					SISKO			Not just yet.					NOG			Too bad. Those guys are the best.			They're the only people I know who			aren't afraid of the Dominion.					SISKO			Why's that?	Nog doesn't understand this line of questioning.					NOG			I don't know. They're not scared			of anything, I guess.	Sisko absorbs this news, which means more to him than	it does to Nog.					SISKO			You seem to know them pretty well.					NOG			Jake said I should try to get to			know them better. Show them I'm			a good guy. And so far it seems			to be working.				(shrinks down a notch)			The truth is, I think they only			like me because I know you.					SISKO			Is that so?					NOG			You're kind of their hero. The			man at the front line in the war			with the Dominion.	Sisko seems to think about this for a beat, then...     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11,/14/95 - ACT ONE    10.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			I'd like to meet some of these			cadets. You think you could			introduce me to one of them?	Nog looks surprised that Sisko would make such a	request.					NOG			I'm sorry. I can't do that, sir.				(tries to explain)			The names of Red Squad members are			supposed to be secret.					SISKO			But you know who they are.					NOG				(modest)			It's not easy keeping secrets from			a Ferengi. But I feel funny about			telling anyone else. Besides, if			they found out I told you who they			were, I'd never get in.	But Sisko's not about to let Nog off the hook so	easily.					SISKO			Cadet, you're obviously under the			mistaken impression that I'm			asking you a favor. I want a			name, and I want it now. And that			is an order. Understood, Mister			Nog?	Nog, caught between a rock and a hard place, nods	reluctantly.					NOG			Yes, sir.10   INT. SISKO'S TEMPORARY OFFICE - DAY	Sisko is seated at his desk as the door opens and in	walks a confident, nineteen- to twenty-year-old	Starfleet cadet, RILEY SHEPARD.

He's glad to	have come to Sisko's attention.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT ONE     12.10   CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO			Cadet, I've been reviewing a			record of Red Squad's activities			on the night of the twenty-third.			The night of the power outage.	This catches Shepard off guard.					SHEPARD			Record, sir? We were told that			there wasn't going to be any			written record...					SISKO			Are you contradicting me, cadet?	Shepard is confused. He's one of the brightest kids in	his class and he's not used to getting called onto the	carpet.					SHEPARD			No, sir.					SISKO			Good. Now, who told you there			wasn't going to be a written			record?					SHEPARD			The briefing officer, sir.					SISKO			I want that officer's name.					SHEPARD			She didn't give her name, sir.			But she told us that there would			be no record of our actions. That			our role would have to go			unrecognized, at least for now.	Sisko goes on the attack again.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT ONE     13.10   CONTINUED:	(4)					SISKO			Maybe if you'd done your job			better, it would have.				(getting in Shepard's face)			But you fouled it up, didn't you?			You cadets did some sloppy work...			some damn sloppy work.					SHEPARD			With all due respect, sir...			that's not true, sir. The mission			went perfectly. If anything, it			was easier than the simulations.					SISKO			Son, if you think you can protect			your hide by lying to me, you'd			better forget it. Mistakes were			made, and I will find out who's			responsible.					SHEPARD			I'm not lying to you, sir. I was			there. I was at Planetary			Operations the whole time. If			anything had gone wrong, I			would've known about it.	Sisko looks skeptical.					SISKO			Is that so?	Sisko looks like he's considering Shepard's point of	view. Finally, he softens slightly, as if trying to	keep an open mind.					SISKO			All right, cadet. Let's go over			this step-by-step from the time of			your mission deployment until your			return to base...				(checking the PADD)			... at nineteen forty-seven hours			PST on the twenty-third.					SHEPARD			Yes, sir. We assembled on the			Eastern Quad at seventeen hundred			hours on the evening of the twenty-			third.	This is what Sisko wanted. He encourages the cadet to	continue.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT ONE     14.10   CONTINUED:	(5)					SISKO			By "we" I assume you mean Red			Squad.					SHEPARD				(eager to please)			Yes, sir. After assembly we were			beamed aboard the Lakota. Once			aboard we received our equipment			and the necessary codes, and were			transported directly to the			Division of Planetary Operations			in Lisbon.					SISKO			At what time?					SHEPARD			It was oh-four hundred hours			exactly. Local time of course.					SISKO			Go on, cadet.					SHEPARD			Our contact inside the DPO gave us			access to their computer control			network. From there we used the			access codes we were given,			bypassed the security lockouts,			and downloaded the disordering			protocols into the network.					SISKO				(putting it together)			And from there the protocols			spread to every power relay on the			planet.					SHEPARD			It was a pretty, impressive sight,			sir. Watching those relays wink			out one after another.					SISKO			Sorry I missed it.	Shepard now thinks everything is okay. Whatever Sisko	thought went wrong, Shepard has proved it wasn't his	fault.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT ONE     15.10   CONTINUED:	(6)					SHEPARD			After that all we had to do was			sabotage the restart sequencers			and get out.

It's	after hours and they need a place to talk. Sisko is	looking concerned and focused.					ODO			Are you sure this cadet is telling			the truth?					SISKO			He admitted to committing acts of			treason against the Federation.			If he was going to lie, I think he			would've come up with a better			story.					ODO			I take it you gave him a blood			screening.					SISKO			I checked him myself. He's human.					ODO			Well then let's say he's telling			the truth... that he was ordered			by his superiors to sabotage the			power relays. That still doesn't			rule out Dominion involvement.			For all we know, his superiors			have been replaced by changelings.					SISKO			I thought about that. But if it			were changelings, what have they			accomplished? There's been no			invasion, power's been restored...					ODO			And Starfleet has fortified Earth.			I see your point, Captain.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT ONE    15A.10A  CONTINUED:		Sisko moves into the kitchen and takes out a glass		bottle full of milk.					ODO			So let's say you're right.			Starfleet officers sabotaged the			power grid.

This is tremendously	difficult for him but he pushes on.					SISKO			Sir, I believe that certain			Starfleet officers, led by Admiral			Leyton, are conspiring to			overthrow the legitimate			government of the Federation.			and replace it with military rule.	And as the President reacts, as much to Odo and Sisko's	grim demeanor as to Sisko's words, we...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO     17.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:12   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS	Jaresh-Inyo is seated behind his desk, his attention	totally focused on Sisko, who stands before him.					JARESH-INYO			Captain, I have been in politics			for seventy years. I'm no			stranger to overstatement and			exaggeration. But the idea that			Starfleet would plot to overthrow			the government of the Federation			is the single most astonishing			accusation I've ever heard.					SISKO			Sir, if you'll hear us out...					JARESH-INYO			Oh, I intend to, though you'll			have to forgive me if I remain			somewhat skeptical.				(a beat)			Now I think you'd better start			from the beginning.	Sisko turns to Odo. That's his cue.					ODO			Several months ago, I learned from			one of my people that changelings			had infiltrated the Federation.			Not long after I gave this			information to Starfleet, records			indicate that Admiral Leyton led			a contingent of high ranking			officers to meet with you and			recommend the implementation of			sweeping security measures meant			to protect Earth.					JARESH-INYO				(nods)			And I rejected their suggestions			as too extreme.					ODO			It's no secret that Leyton didn't			agree with you.   84:[1,#b],90:[1,#b]     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO     18.12   CONTINUED:					ODO (Cont'd)			And despite your calls for calm,			his concern about the Dominion			threat continued to grow.					SISKO			When the Antwerp Conference was			bombed, Leyton became convinced			that the changelings posed a much			greater threat to Earth than you			were prepared to admit.	So far, there's nothing Jaresh-Inyo can argue with.					JARESH-INYO			And so the Admiral approached me			again. That time with you two at			his side. And I agreed to his			proposals.					SISKO			To some of his proposals.					ODO			We believe that Admiral Leyton and			his supporters weren't satisfied			with the limited security			procedures you authorized. They			were convinced that extraordinary			measures were necessary to counter			the changeling threat.					SISKO			More than that, they were			determined to prove to you and to			everyone else just how vulnerable			Earth was to a Dominion takeover.				(a beat)			So they sabotaged the global power			grid.	Jaresh-Inyo is shocked.					JARESH-INYO			Starfleet officers committing			sabotage?					SISKO			I know exactly how you feel. But			it's the truth.	The President still isn't sold.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO    18A.12   CONTINUED:	(2)					JARESH-INYO			I find that difficult to believe.			Admiral Leyton may be somewhat			grating and inflexible at times,			but for a man of his			accomplishments, of his			distinguished record... to commit			treason?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO     19.12   CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO			I'm sure the Admiral doesn't see			it as treason. He would probably			defend it as a desperate act of			patriotism. Leyton and his			supporters think their actions are			both necessary and justified.					ODO			Not to mention effective.				(a beat)			Think about it. The power grid			fails and the next thing you know,			there are Starfleet security			officers on the streets of every			city, armed with phaser rifles,			blood testing citizens at random.	Jaresh-Inyo looks at Sisko for a long time. He doesn't	want to believe what he's just heard, but Sisko makes	a persuasive argument.					JARESH-INYO			Your story has a certain logic to			it, gentlemen. But what it lacks			so far is proof.					SISKO			You want proof... Order Admiral			Leyton to withdraw his troops from			the streets... see what he does.					JARESH-INYO			You think he would refuse a direct			order from his commander-in-chief?					SISKO			If he orders his troops to stand			down, then I'm wrong and I'll			offer my resignation. But I don't			think that's going to happen.			With those troops in place,			Admiral Leyton controls Earth.			And he's not going to give up that			control until he's convinced he's			ended the Dominion threat.	Jaresh-Inyo gets up and paces around the room.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO     20.12   CONTINUED:	(4)					JARESH-INYO			And he may not have to give up			anything.				(a beat)			If what you say is true, if the			power outage was all part of			Leyton's plan, then it's worked			perfectly. Right now the public			overwhelmingly supports the			increased security. If I tried to			remove the troops, over Leyton's			objections, I'd have a planetwide			riot on my hands.					SISKO			What if we bring you proof? Hard			evidence linking Leyton to the			sabotage of the power grid?					ODO			With that, you could force Leyton			to stand down, make him withdraw			the troops.	Jaresh-Inyo considers Sisko's offer.					JARESH-INYO			If what you say is true, I'll have			his resignation.				(a beat)			Bring me that evidence, and I			promise you, I'll use it.	Sisko nods. He and Odo both know that they've been	given an opportunity. Now they have to deliver.13   INT. SISKO'S CREOLE KITCHEN - NIGHT	It's long after closing. Sisko sits at a table	drinking a cup of raktajino. Odo paces around the	room.					ODO			Cadet Shepard should've been here			twenty minutes ago.					SISKO			I told Nog to make sure no one saw			them leave the Academy. With the			added security in place, I'm sure			that wasn't easy.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO    20A.13   CONTINUED:					ODO			What if they got caught?					SISKO			Nog spent his entire adolescence			dodging you on the Promenade. If			anyone can sneak out of that place			it's him.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO     21.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO			I suppose so. I doubt there's			ever been a cadet in Starfleet who			was quite so... slippery.	Just then, there's a knock at the door. Odo goes and	looks through the window, then opens the door. Nog	ENTERS, looking harried.					NOG			Sorry I'm late...					SISKO			Where's Cadet Shepherd?					NOG			That's a good question. I			couldn't find him anywhere.					ODO			What do you mean, you couldn't			find him?					NOG			I mean he's gone. And as far as			I can tell so is every other			member of Red Squad. The rumor is			they've all been sent on some kind			of training exercise.					LEYTON (O.S.)			I'm afraid Cadet Shepherd won't be			returning to Earth anytime soon.14   NEW ANGLE	To reveal ADMIRAL LEYTON, who has just entered. Nog,	who has no idea what's really going on, sees an	opportunity to make an important connection.					NOG			Admiral Leyton, it's an honor to			meet you. My name is --					LEYTON				(interrupting)			Return to your quarters, cadet.	Nog is surprised and a little disappointed at the	sharpness of Leyton's tone. He looks to Sisko, who	nods. Nog EXITS.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO     22.14   CONTINUED:					LEYTON			Ben, I think you and I need to			talk.				(looks to Odo)			In private.					ODO				(to Sisko)			I'll be in the next room if you			need me.	Odo takes a hard look at Leyton, then EXITS.					LEYTON			Mind if I get some coffee?					SISKO			Help yourself.	Leyton goes and pours himself a cup.					LEYTON			I haven't been getting a lot of			sleep lately. Too much to do.					SISKO				(pointedly)			Maybe you need a vacation.	Leyton looks over at Sisko and smiles. He knows what	Sisko's implying, but he doesn't take the bait.					LEYTON				(sips the coffee)			Mmm. Somehow replicated coffee			never tastes this good.	Leyton comes over and takes a seat across from Sisko.					LEYTON			I'm afraid I owe you an apology,			Ben.					SISKO				(softly)			The way I see it, you owe a lot of			people an apology.	Sisko's quiet tone belies his disappointment at Leyton.	Leyton's response is equally controlled. These are two	professional soldiers with an enormous amount of	respect for each other and they're both determined to	keep their emotions in check.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO     23.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					LEYTON				(shakes his head)			I wish I could've told you the			truth from the beginning. But			somehow I suspected we wouldn't			see eye-to-eye on this thing.					SISKO			Then why did you bring me here?					LEYTON				(simply)			Because I needed someone who knew			how to fight Shape-shifters. And			that's you.				(a beat)			And I suppose on some level I			hoped that once you saw what we			were accomplishing, you'd join us.				(a beat)			You always had a strong sense of			duty.	Leyton is reaching out to Sisko, but Sisko refuses to	cross the gulf between them.					SISKO			My duty is to protect the			Federation.					LEYTON			Which is what we're trying to do.					SISKO			What you're trying to do is seize			control of Earth and place it			under military rule.					LEYTON			If that's what it takes to stop			the Dominion.	Sisko makes one last attempt to get Leyton to see the	irony in what he's doing.					SISKO			You're willing to destroy paradise			in order to save it.	Leyton studies Sisko for a beat, trying to figure out	a way to reach his former executive officer.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO    23A.14   CONTINUED:	(3)					LEYTON			Do you remember when we were on			the Okinawa fighting the			Tzenkethi? That time when I			wanted to take the ship into an			asteroid belt to chase down those			three raiders. We talked it over			at the staff meeting...					SISKO				(remembering)			And I said it was an unnecessary			risk.					LEYTON			You spoke your mind. Which is			exactly what a good executive			officer is supposed to do. But I			overruled you.				(beat)			After the staff meeting you			followed me into my ready room and			tried to argue your point again.					SISKO			That's right, I did.					LEYTON			And remember what I told you?					SISKO			That a good officer has to respect			the chain of command. There comes			a time when you have to accept the			orders of a superior officer and			carry out his orders, whether you			agree with them or not.					LEYTON			I also told you when you became a			C.O., you'd feel the same way.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO     24.14   CONTINUED:	(4)					SISKO			And you were right. About going			after the Tzenkethi and about me.					LEYTON			Without the chain of command,			Starfleet would cease to function			and we wouldn't stand a chance			against our enemies.				(driving home his point)			I'm still your commanding officer.			And now more than ever, I need you			to respect my authority.					SISKO			I can't do that. Not this time.	Leyton is clearly exasperated and disappointed in	Sisko's attitude. He realizes he's not going to win	Sisko over.					LEYTON			Then as of now, I'm relieving you			of your post as temporary head of			Earth Security and sending you			back to Deep Space Nine.				(a beat)			Go home, Ben. You don't belong			here.	Leyton EXITS.15   CLOSE ON SISKO	As he reacts to this disturbing conversation...15A  EXT.

How's			your father?	Sisko studies O'Brien closely.					SISKO			There's no way the Defiant			could've gotten here so soon.					O'BRIEN			I didn't say I came on the			Defiant.				(confidentially)			Tell me the truth. Do you really			think phaser rifles will do any			good against...				(smiles)			... Shape-shifters?	O'Brien gives Sisko a cocky smile. Sisko realizes that O'Brien is a 	changeling.					SISKO			You're not O'Brien.					O'BRIEN			Luckily, no. The thought of being			locked in one shape all of the			time... it's not natural.	Sisko glances around the grounds, looking for some backup.					O'BRIEN			Don't bother calling for help. It			would only cut our conversation			short. And I do enjoy your			company.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Paradise Lost" - REV. 11/14/95 - ACT TWO    24B.15B  CONTINUED:					SISKO			If you have something to say to			me... say it.					O'BRIEN			You solids. You're so impatient.			I thought we could sit here for a			while, maybe go to a bar, have a			pint, throw some darts.					SISKO			I don't think so.					O'BRIEN			Let me ask you a question.
