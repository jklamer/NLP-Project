SISKO'S QUARTERS	SISKO is sitting on his couch, his finger on a control 	pad on a nearby table. The room is DARK and moody. 	The captain has just gone through a long and trying 	ordeal and now wants to unburden himself. He faces	camera and addresses us directly as he begins to 	dictate his private log.					SISKO			Captain's Personal Log: Stardate			Five-one-seven...				(unsure) 			Five-one-seven... four?	He trails off, suddenly aware of the fact that he 	doesn't even know what day this is.					SISKO				(annoyed) 			Computer -- what day is it?					COMPUTER VOICE 			Thursday. Stardate 51721.3.					SISKO				(to himself)			It's only been two weeks...	He loses himself for a beat, then remembers that he's 	recording a log. He looks up at us again.					SISKO 			I need to talk about this. I have 			to justify what's happened... what 			I've done... at least to myself. 			I can't talk to anyone else... not 			even Dax. Maybe if I just lay it 			all out in my log, it'll finally 			make sense... and I'll see where 			it all went wrong... where I went 			wrong.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - TEASER      2.1    CONTINUED:					SISKO (Cont'd) 				(beat) 			I suppose it all started two weeks 			ago when I was posting the weekly 			casualty list in the wardroom...									CUT TO:2    INT. WARDROOM	Sisko is working the control pad next to the large wall 	monitor.					SISKO (V.O.)			... every Friday morning, for the 			past three months, I've posted the 			official list of Starfleet 			personnel killed, wounded or 			missing in the war.	Sisko hits a final control and a large OKUDAGRAM 	APPEARS on the monitor: a long list of NAMES. They're 	grouped by ship or starbase and then alphabetized by 	last name. Each name has a brightly colored tag next 	to it: KIA, WIA, MIA. Sisko steps away from the 	monitor and we REVEAL that the room is FILLED with 	Starfleet Officers: BASHIR, WORF and DAX are among 	the many N.D. Officers waiting to take a look at the 	list. They all move slowly toward the list and begin 	reading it over. The mood is grim -- everyone is here 	hoping against hope that they won't find the name of 	a loved one or friend on that list.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - TEASER      3.2    CONTINUED:	FOLLOW Sisko as he moves across the room and watches 	the reactions as the officers read the board. As the 	scene continues, there should be MORE N.D. Officers 	ENTERING the Wardroom, while others EXIT after checking 	the board.					SISKO (V.O.)				(continuing, over above				action)			It's become something of a grim			ritual around here. Not a week			goes by that someone doesn't find			the name of a loved one, a friend			or an acquaintance on that damned			list.				(beat) 			I've grown to hate Fridays.	Dax is running her finger down the list looking for 	anyone she knows. Worf and Bashir are relieved when 	they don't see anyone they recognize, but then Dax 	finds a name she knows and reacts. Worf puts an arm 	around her as they move aside to let others check the 	board. Sisko sees the look on her face and joins them 	just as Dax takes a seat in one of the lounge chairs.					SISKO			Someone you knew?					DAX			Leslie Wong.					SISKO			The skipper of the Cairo?					DAX				(nods) 			She was an instructor at the 			Academy when I was a sophomore.					BASHIR 			Do you know what happened to the 			Cairo?					SISKO			Just that they disappeared on 			patrol near the Romulan Neutral 			Zone. But I'll look into it.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - TEASER      4.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX 				(bitter) 			Don't bother. I'm sure it's the 			same old story -- the Jem'Hadar 			crossed over the Romulan border 			and caught them off-guard. It's 			only about the hundredth time it's 			happened.					BASHIR 			I can't believe the Romulans are 			allowing them to violate their 			territory so brazenly. How do 			they get away with it?					SISKO			The Romulans have a treaty of non-			aggression and friendship with the 			Dominion. In practical terms that 			means they're willing to turn a 			blind eye to almost anything in 			the name of "friendship."					WORF 				(bitter) 			It's an intolerable situation. 			We should cross the Neutral Zone 			and destroy the Dominion bases.					DAX			And risk war with the Romulans? 			No, thank you. We're losing 			enough good people as it is. The 			last thing we need is a war on two 			fronts.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - TEASER      5.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR			What we need is to bring the 			Romulans into the war on our side. 			With the combined forces of the 			Federation, the Klingons and the 			Romulans we could finally go on the 			offensive.	We PUSH in on Sisko as he listens to this idea and to 	Dax's response -- a thoughtful look comes over his face 	and we can see that he's mulling over something.					DAX 			That's the last thing the Romulans 			want. Think about it -- they're 			in the perfect position. They get 			to sit back and watch as their 			biggest rivals slug it out in a 			long, bloody war. No one's 			threatening their interests. Why 			should they risk their necks? 			There's simply no reason for them 			to get involved in our war. No			reason at all...	HOLD on Sisko's thoughtful expression for a moment...					SISKO (V.O.) 			That was the moment I made the 			decision. It was like I had 			stepped through a door and locked 			it behind me. I was going to 			bring the Romulans into the war.									CUT TO:3    INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS	As before.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - TEASER      6.3    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			I was absolutely sure it was the 			right decision -- that's the			frightening part -- how right it 			seemed at the time. And now... 			now all I can do is learn to live 			with that decision. 				(beat) 			And I'll have to live with it for 			the rest of my life...	Off the dark and brooding expression on Sisko's face...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Sisko is pacing, thinking out loud and using Dax as a 	sounding board.					SISKO 			It's in their own best interest 			to join the war -- that's the key, 			that's the reason the Romulans 			will finally take action. Not to 			do us any favors, but to protect 			themselves from the Dominion.					DAX			Okay. Let's say I'm the Romulan 			Proconsol. From where I'm 			sitting, the Dominion isn't a 			threat to me. I have a 			nonaggression pact with them. 			They're my allies.					SISKO			You're not going to put your faith 			in some piece of paper are you?					DAX			Not at all. I've been watching 			the Dominion very closely since 			the beginning of the war. And so 			far, they've kept their part of 			the bargain.	The tone here starts getting more heated -- they're 	both pushing their roles and their arguments as hard 	as they can.					SISKO 			They're violating your territory 			almost every day -- what kind of 			an ally is that?					DAX			So they're crossing through my 			backyard to give the Federation 			a bloody nose. I can't say that 			makes me very sad.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT ONE      8.4    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			You can't be naive enough to think 			the Dominion will stop with the 			Federation? When they're finished 			with us, they'll be coming after 			you.					DAX				(dismissive) 			That's speculation.					SISKO			The Founders see it as their 			sacred duty to bring order to the 			galaxy. Their order. Do you 			think they'll sit idly by and let 			you keep your chaotic empire next 			to their perfect order? No. If 			you watch us go under, what you're 			really doing is writing your own 			death warrant.					DAX			You're asking me to start a war 			based on wild theories.					SISKO			They're not theories, they're 			facts!					DAX 			Prove it!     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT ONE      9.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 			How?					DAX			That's your problem. But before 			I plunge my people into a conflict 			that'll kill millions of loyal 			Romulan citizens, I'll need 			something more concrete than the 			self-serving arguments of a 			Starfleet officer. I'll need 			proof of Dominion duplicity. Not 			more words, proof!	They glare at each other for a beat before Sisko breaks	the moment and lets go of the emotion of the moment.					SISKO 			Not bad, old man. You'd have made 			a decent Romulan.					DAX				(relaxing) 			Thanks. But I prefer spots to 			pointed ears.					SISKO			Okay you convinced me. They're 			going to need evidence...				(beat) 			But, if there is evidence of a 			Dominion plan to attack Romulus, 			it's probably buried deep in the 			bowels of their headquarters on 			Cardassia Prime.					DAX			Not exactly the most accessible 			place in the galaxy.	Beat.					SISKO 			Not for us, maybe. But there is 			someone on this station who 			specializes in gaining access to 			places he's not welcome.									CUT TO:     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

WARDROOM	GARAK is looking at Sisko with a surprised expression.					GARAK			I must say I'm flattered, Captain. 			I had no idea you held such a 			lofty opinion of me.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT ONE     10.5    CONTINUED:					GARAK (Cont'd) 			Your faith in my ability to 			retrieve classified information 			from my former homeland is most 			gratifying.					SISKO			I'm happy that you're happy. Now, 			can you do it?	Garak pauses for a moment, then shifts gears.					GARAK 			You know, I had assumed this 			meeting was about the 			modifications I suggested for your 			new dress uniform -- you have had 			an opportunity to look over my 			design, haven't you? The new 			piping along the collar, the 			exaggerated cut of the jacket 			hemline emphasizing the--					SISKO			Mister Garak. Let's dispense with 			the usual repartee and concentrate 			on the issue at hand. Can you do 			the job or not?	Garak sits back and considers Sisko with a cold eye as 	something icy and unpleasant comes over his features.					GARAK 			No one wants to see the Dominion 			destroyed more than I do. But asking 			me to go to Cardassia Prime, 			penetrate one of the most heavily 			guarded facilities in the quadrant, 			steal top secret war plans and then 			return them safely to you is not just 			another "job." It's more like a 			suicide mission and that is well 			outside my field of expertise.					SISKO			I didn't say you had to go there 			yourself. I have to believe that a 			man like you still has a few contacts 			back home. A colleague from the 			Obsidian Order...  DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

I'd say it's time to 			call in a favor.	Garak considers this for a long beat.					GARAK 			It would mean calling in all my 			favors, captain. To do what 			you're asking would use up every 			resource I have left on Cardassia. 			And it may be a very messy, very 			bloody business. Are you prepared 			for that?					SISKO			I posted my fourteenth casualty 			list this morning. I'm already 			involved in a very messy, very 			bloody business. And the only way 			I can see to end it is to bring 			the Romulans into the war. I'm 			prepared to do whatever it takes 			to accomplish that goal, but I 			can't do it alone. I need help. 			Now, are you in or out?	Garak looks into his eyes for a long beat, takes the 	measure of Sisko and his commitment, then stands and 	puts out his hand.					GARAK 			I'm in.	They shake hands.					SISKO (V.O.) 			My father used to say that the 			road to hell is paved with good 			intentions.									CUT TO:  DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

I'd 			pay any price, go to any lengths, 			because my cause was righteous.				(beat) 			My... intentions were good.

OPS	Sisko, Kira, Worf and Dax are gathered around the Ops 	table, which has a MAP of the Federation and the 	Dominion. A large ARROW is thrusting into the heart 	of the Federation.					SISKO 			From the initial reports, it seems 			that the invasion force must have 			come from somewhere in the 			Calandra Sector.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT TWO     15.9    CONTINUED:					DAX 			Did Starfleet Intelligence know 			anything about a buildup in that 			Sector?					WORF 			No. They believed Calandra was 			too far from Dominion supply lines 			to be a threat.					SISKO			There's plenty of blame to go 			around. The Tenth Fleet was 			supposed to be protecting Betazed 			and its outlying colonies, but 			they were caught out of position 			on a training exercise. What's 			worse, Betazed's own defense 			systems are obsolete and 			undermanned.				(beat) 			The planet was theirs in less than 			ten hours.	A grim, quiet beat.					KIRA 			With Betazed in the hands of the 			Jem'Hadar, the Dominion's in a 			position to threaten Vulcan... 			Andor...

Have 			you made any progress?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT TWO     16.10   CONTINUED:					GARAK 			Well... I suppose that depends on 			how you look at it.					SISKO				(pushing) 			How I look at it is that Betazed has 			just fallen to the Dominion and we 			need to get this operation underway.					GARAK			I share your desire for swift 			action, captain. In fact, after 			our last conversation, I made a 			few discreet inquiries among my 			former associates still living on 			Cardassia. As I anticipated, they 			shared my loathing for the current 			government and were more than 			willing to take on an assignment 			aimed at its destruction.					SISKO			That sounds like progress to me.					GARAK			Doesn't it? Unfortunately... 			they're all dead now.					SISKO			What?					GARAK 				(distant) 			Yes. All killed within one day 			of speaking with me. I suppose 			that's a testament to the 			effectiveness of Dominion 			security. One should admire 			such... efficiency.	He goes back to working on the clothes.					SISKO 			I'm sorry.	He turns to go, but Garak stops him.					GARAK 			I hope you're not giving up that 			easily.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

He's been 			a key member of the Romulan Senate 			for the past fourteen years.14   RESUME					GARAK				(continuing) 			He's Secretary of the War Plans 			Council, Vice-Chairman of the Tal 			Shiar, and one of the most trusted 			advisors to Proconsul Neral.					SISKO			He's also the man who negotiated 			the non-aggression pact with the 			Dominion.					GARAK			Since you're familiar with him, 			I'll skip the rest of his 			biography. What's important is 			that he continues to be one of the 			most ardently pro-Dominion voices 			in the Senate. If we can convince 			him that the Dominion is a threat, 			the rest of the Senate will follow.					SISKO			Okay. How?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT TWO     19.14   CONTINUED:					GARAK 			Ten days from now, Senator Vreenak 			will be making a trip to Soukara 			for a diplomatic meeting with 			Weyoun. I'm certain he could be 			persuaded to make a secret detour 			to D.S. Nine if he were invited 			by one Captain Benjamin Sisko.					SISKO			How do you know Vreenak's visiting 			Soukara?					GARAK			There are some things I'd rather 			not discuss. May I continue? 				(off his nod) 			When the Senator arrives, you will 			show him a holographic recording 			of a secret meeting held at the 			highest levels of the Dominion in 			which the planned invasion of 			Romulus is being discussed. You 			will tell the Senator that this 			information was obtained through 			various covert means at great cost 			to the Federation -- "at least ten 			good men lost their lives bringing 			it across the lines" -- that sort 			of thing. He will immediately 			suspect that it's a forgery, but 			you will assure him that such a 			thing would be impossible. 				(beat) 			"You see Senator, this is an 			official Cardassian transcript. 			It was recorded on a one-time 			optolythic data-rod used for 			official record-keeping. These 			rods are manufactured only as 			needed on Cardassia Prime. 			Information can only be 			transcribed on them once, and then 			cannot be altered."     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

At least, so 			it will appear.					SISKO			And in reality... ?					GARAK 			You will have handed him a genuine 			optolythic data-rod, but it will 			contain one of the most perfect 			forgeries ever fashioned. I'm 			still working on obtaining the 			data-rod, but I have located the 			man who will create the holo-			recording.	Garak pauses and looks at Sisko expectantly. Sisko 	takes a few steps around the room. It's a huge leap 	he's about to take.					SISKO 			You realize, I can't authorize 			something like this on my own. 			I'll have to clear it with 			Starfleet Command.					GARAK			Of course. But I suspect that 			with the fall of Betazed they'll 			be ready to do whatever it takes 			to bring the Romulans into the war.					SISKO 			I'll let you know.	Sisko heads for the door, but Garak stops him.					GARAK 			One last thing, captain. The man 			we need to forge the holo-program 			is currently sitting in a Klingon 			prison awaiting execution.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

WARDROOM	GRATHON TOLAR is sitting across from Sisko with a 	relieved expression on his face. Tolar is a small, 	weasel-faced ALIEN and does not look like someone who'd 	last very long in a Klingon prison. His clothes are 	clean and neatly worn, but there's a palpable oiliness 	to him that makes you want to bath immediately after 	any visit.

I have to promise to 			stay away from the Klingon Empire.				(laugh)			That'll be tough.				(laugh) 			And I have to create some kind of 			"special" holo-program for you.				(laugh)			I can't wait. I've never worked 			for Starfleet before.					SISKO			Let's be very clear about this -- 			you're not working for Starfleet. 			This entire matter is strictly off 			the record. As far as you're 			concerned, you're working for me.					TOLAR 			Oh. Oh, I see. This is a 			personal matter.				(laugh, then leering) 			Something "special." For your 			eyes only.

QUARK'S	Sisko ENTERS to find Odo waiting for him by the door. 	Tolar is sitting at a table, his hands in restraints 	and a pair of Bajoran Deputies standing guard over him. 	QUARK, whose chest is covered with BLOOD, is being 	attended to by Bashir on the other side of the room. 	A dabo girl with a torn dress sits near Quark, shooting 	Tolar daggers with her eyes. The bar has been emptied 	of all customers.					SISKO 			What happened?					ODO			As I understand it, Mister Tolar 			over there came in about two hours 			ago and ordered a bottle of Whelan 			Bitters. Fifteen minutes later, 			he ordered a second bottle. Then 			a third. He was halfway through 			his fourth when he decided to 			dance with...				(re: dabo girl)			...M'Pella. She was otherwise 			engaged running the Dabo wheel at 			the time and declined his 			invitation. He decided to force 			the issue and there was a brief 			struggle before Quark, in an 			uncharacteristic display of 			chivalry, attempted to intervene. 			So Tolar stabbed him.	Sisko glares at Tolar, who gives him a half-smile and 	a shrug.					ODO 			Normally, he'd be sitting in a 			holding cell, but he claimed that 			he was a friend of yours.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

Should I reply?					SISKO			No reply, major. Sisko out.	Sisko and Garak stop outside a doorway that has a 	MONITOR on the wall next to it. Sisko activates the 	monitor and it shows a high-angle view of the interior 	of a LANDING BAY. The space doors are closed and no 	one is inside. He works the controls for a moment and 	then FLASHING LIGHTS come on inside the bay.27   INT.

LANDING BAY (OPTICAL)	Suddenly a ROMULAN SHUTTLE DECLOAKS in the middle of 	the landing bay. Almost immediately, a GANTRY begins 	EXTENDING from the Landing Bay Airlock toward the hatch 	on the shuttle.34   INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	The gantry can be seen moving toward the shuttle on the 	monitor.					GARAK 			I'll take my leave of you now, 			captain.				(hesitates) 			And one last thing -- Vreenak 			thinks he's on the winning side. 			Until you can prove otherwise, you 			may have to put up with a 			certain... acerbic attitude.					SISKO			After working with you for a week, 			Mister Garak, I've developed a 			very, very thick skin.					GARAK				(smiles) 			Good luck.	Garak EXITS down the Corridor just before the Airlock 	hatch ROLLS OPEN and two armed N.D.

WARDROOM (OPTICAL)	Sisko is sitting with Vreenak over in the "lounge" area 	of the Wardroom. They each have something to drink, 	but only Vreenak seems interested in his beverage.					VREENAK				(re: glass) 			A fair approximation. But 			somewhat lacking in aroma. Real 			kali-fal should forcibly open 			one's sinuses well before the 			first sip.					SISKO			We don't have much experience in 			replicating Romulan beverages. Of 			course, all that would change if we 			were allies instead of cold warriors.					VREENAK 			You are persistent, I'll grant you 			that, captain. But I'm afraid 			dogged determination isn't enough 			to change the reality of your 			situation. Time is definitely not 			on your side.				(beat) 			The Dominion shipyards are working 			at one hundred percent capacity -- 			your facilities are still being 			rebuilt. The Dominion is breeding 			legions of Jem'Hadar soldiers every 			day -- you're experiencing a 			manpower shortage. But more 			important, the Dominion is resolved 			to win the war, no matter what the 			cost -- and we both know the 			Federation has already put out peace 			feelers.				(beat) 			Now I ask you, captain -- in all 			candor -- if you were in my 			position, which side would you 			choose?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT FOUR    40.35   CONTINUED:					SISKO 			I'd pick the side most likely to 			leave me in peace when the dust 			settles. Maybe you're right, maybe 			the Dominion will win in the end. 			Then the Founders will control what 			is now called Cardassia, the Klingon 			Empire and the Federation. So 			instead of facing three separate 			opponents with three separate 			agendas, you'll find yourselves 			facing the same opponent on every 			side. There's a word for that -- 			surrounded.	Vreenak takes another sip of his drink.					VREENAK 			It really is a good replica. Even 			the aroma is starting to grow on 			me. For a moment there, I almost 			forgot that it wasn't the real 			thing. But only for a moment. 				(beat) 			You make some very good points, 			captain, but it's still all 			speculation and theory. Nothing that 			would warrant abrogating our treaty 			and plunging the Empire into war.					SISKO			What if I told you that the 			Dominion is planning a sneak 			attack on the Romulan Empire at 			this very moment?	Vreenak stops his glass halfway to his mouth. His eyes 	narrow.					VREENAK 			I'd want proof.					SISKO 			And what if I showed it to you? 			What then? Would you join us in 			the war? Or would you wait until 			there were Jem'Hadar soldiers 			standing in your Senate Chamber 			before you decided that the 			Founders weren't your friends 			after all?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

HOLOSUITE/DOMINION MEETING ROOM (OPTICAL)	Sisko and Vreenak are watching the end of the same 	Dominion planning session we saw earlier between 	Weyoun, Damar and the N.D. Legates.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT FOUR    42.36   CONTINUED:	(The free-standing console with the data-rod is in 	front of Sisko.) Weyoun is now at the large monitor, 	which has a schematic display of the Cardassian/Romulan 	border. Several clearly marked ARROWS are thrusting 	from Cardassia to points deep inside Romulan territory.					WEYOUN			... and with the Cardassian Fourth 			Order protecting their flank, the 			Twenty-third Jem'Hadar division can 			begin its thrust across the Glintara 			Sector. They should begin the 			invasion of Romulus itself on the 			following day. Once we've taken the 			homeworld, organized resistance will 			crumble when the outlying systems 			and colonies begin looking out for 			themselves. Consolidation of the 			entire Empire will take three months 			at most.					DAMAR 			What if the Romulan fleet reacts 			faster than you're anticipating? 			What if they pull all their forces 			away from the Federation border 			at the first sign of our attack?					WEYOUN				(growing tired of this) 			They've been staring across the 			Neutral Zone at the Federation for 			the better part of two centuries. 			It's become an obsession with 			their military leaders. There's 			not the slightest chance of them 			leaving the Neutral Zone 			undefended until they're sure the 			Federation isn't going to take 			advantage of the situation. And 			by then, it'll be too late.					DAMAR 			You're placing a lot of faith in 			your ability to predict what the 			Romulans will or will not do. They 			could surprise us all -- they could 			even be anticipating this attack 			already. If that's the case, we 			could find ourselves fighting a war 			on two fronts without any --     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT FOUR    43.36   CONTINUED:	(2)					WEYOUN 			I place my faith in the Founders. 			And they say that the Romulans are 			not ready for war and that they 			will not react fast enough once 			it begins. Now, do you wish to 			dispute their judgment?	Damar doesn't like it, but he knows where his bread is 	buttered.					DAMAR 			No. Of course not. I serve the 			Founders.					WEYOUN			As do we all. Meeting adjourned.	The simulation VANISHES and is momentarily replaced 	with the FLOATING 3-D image of the CARDASSIAN LOGO, 	then that too VANISHES. Sisko turns to look at 	Vreenak, whose face carefully betrays no feelings. 	Vreenak takes a few steps around the room as he mulls 	over what he's just seen.					VREENAK 				(quiet) 			I'd like to examine that data-rod.	Sisko removes it from the console, and holds it out to 	Vreenak. The Senator moves to him, but before he takes 	it, he stares into Sisko's eyes, and seems to search 	them for a long beat, as if looking for the truth 	somewhere inside. Finally, Vreenak takes the data-rod 	and looks at it.					CUT TO:37   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Sisko is pacing in his office, lost in thought when Dax 	ENTERS.					DAX 			Got a minute?					SISKO			Sure. What can I do for you?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT FOUR    44.37   CONTINUED:	Dax takes her time, this is a delicate subject and she	doesn't want to rush into anything.					DAX 			This may sound... crazy. But, 			think about it before you say no.					SISKO			Just say it.	Beat.					DAX 			What if we... tricked the Romulans 			into believing that the Dominion 			was about to attack them?	Sisko is thunderstruck for a moment and Dax takes it 	as a reaction to her crazy idea.					DAX 			Hear me out. 				(beat) 			We find a way to manufacture 			evidence of a planned Dominion 			attack. I'm not sure what it 			should be, uh... a series of coded 			messages from their central 			command, a Cardassian defector who 			smuggles out secret war plans -- 			I don't know. Something. Then 			we show it to the Romulans and try 			to convince them that they're one 			step away from disaster.	Sisko takes a moment, decides to become his own devil's 	advocate.					SISKO 			You want to start a war based on 			a lie?					DAX			I want to end a war, Benjamin. 			And I want the good guys to win. 			Besides, let's face it -- the 			Dominion will attack the Romulans 			eventually, it's just a matter of 			time. So, in a way we'd be doing 			them a favor by pulling them in 			now.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT FOUR    45.37   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 				(hard) 			That's an easy way of 			rationalizing something you know 			is wrong.	Dax takes a beat, goes cold and hard.					DAX 			More wrong than war?	Beat.					SISKO			I'll... think about it.					DAX			That's all I ask.	She heads for the door, then stops, smiles to herself.					DAX 			I suppose it's one thing to come 			up with an idea like this... and 			another to put it into motion.					SISKO 				(re: pips) 			That's why they put these on my 			collar, old man.	She smiles at him and then EXITS.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

He's got a bottle of something 	dark and amber now and he pours himself a drink.					SISKO			It was good to know that the old 			man was on my side, even if she 			didn't know what was really going 			on.				(beat) 			In any case, I was way past the 			point of no return. There was 			nothing to do but wait and see how 			masterful Tolar's forgery really 			was.	He takes a drink.					SISKO			So I waited. Tried to catch up 			on my paperwork, but I couldn't 			really focus on criminal activity 			reports or cargo manifests... I 			went back to pacing and staring 			out the window.				(beat)			I don't think of myself as an			impatient man. I don't agonize			over decisions once they're made.			I got that from my father. He			always said that worry and doubt			were the greatest enemies of a			chef.

CORRIDOR	Sisko is walking through the empty Corridor.					SISKO (V.O.) 			If Vreenak discovered the data-rod 			was a forgery, if he realized that 			we were trying to trick them into 			war, it could push the Romulans 			even farther into the enemy camp. 			They could start to openly help 			the Dominion. If worse came to 			worst, they could actually join 			the war against us.

The bottle has been set 	aside.					SISKO 			So it blew up in my face. The 			lies and the compromises, the 			inner doubts and the 			rationalizations -- all for 			nothing. Vreenak was furious. 			I can't say I blamed him. I'd 			have reacted the same way. After 			telling me in no uncertain terms 			that he intended to expose this 			"vile deception" to the entire 			Alpha Quadrant, he got back in his 			shuttle and headed home.				(beat) 			There didn't seem to be anything 			more to do... so I went back to 			work.				(beat) 			Two days later we got the news.									CUT TO:42   INT.

Sisko's mind is far away and he 	moves through the crowd of people without seeing most 	of them. He finds a quiet corner of the room and sits 	down heavily in a chair as the others crowd around the 	monitor, searching the list of names once again. 	Bashir and Dax emerge from the crowd and move toward 	him. Sisko looks at them expectantly.					BASHIR				(to Sisko)			No one for me today.					DAX			I had one -- Maria Tatalia -- 			wounded in action.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale...

GARAK'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS	Where Garak is working on some clothes. He looks up	at Sisko dispassionately -- he was expecting a	confrontation, but he wasn't expecting Sisko to haul	off and DECK HIM. Garak hits the ground and looks up	at the furious captain warily.					SISKO 			Get up.	Garak gets up, and warily keeps his distance. Sisko 	presses him and Garak backs away, but it's clear he 	won't give much ground here.					SISKO 			You killed him.					GARAK			That's right.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT FIVE    51.45   CONTINUED:					SISKO 			That's what you planned to do all 			along. You knew the data-rod 			wouldn't hold up to scrutiny, you 			just wanted to get him on the 			station so you could plant a bomb 			on his shuttle.					GARAK			It wasn't quite that simple. I 			did have hopes that the rod would 			somehow pass inspection. But I 			suspected that Tolar may not have 			been up to the task.					SISKO			What about Tolar? Did you kill 			him too?					GARAK			Think of them both as tragic 			victims of war.	Sisko throws a punch, Garak blocks, but Sisko follows 	up and lands another blow to Garak's face, rocking him 	back, but not flooring him.					GARAK			If you can allow your anger to 			subside for a moment, you'll see 			that they did not die in vain -- 			the Romulans will enter the war.	Sisko glares at him, his fury just barely restrained.					SISKO 			There's no guarantee of that.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT FIVE    52.45   CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK 			Oh, but I think there is. You 			see, when the Tal Shiar finishes 			examining the wreckage of 			Vreenak's shuttle, they'll find 			the burnt remnants of a Cardassian 			optolythic data-rod which 			miraculously survived the 			explosion. After painstaking 			forensic examination, they'll 			discover that the rod contains a 			recording of a high-level Dominion 			meeting at which the invasion of 			Romulus was being planned.					SISKO			And then they'll discover it's a 			fraud.					GARAK			I don't think so. Any 			imperfections in the forgery will 			appear to be a result of the 			explosion.				(building, forceful) 			So, with a seemingly legitimate 			data-rod in one hand and a dead 			senator in the other, I ask you 			captain, what conclusion would you 			draw?	Sisko takes a beat, tries to let his temper subside.					SISKO 			That Vreenak obtained the rod on 			Soukara and that the Dominion 			killed him to prevent him from 			returning to Romulus with it.					GARAK			Precisely. And the more the 			Dominion protests their innocence, 			the more the Romulans will believe 			they're guilty... because it's 			exactly what the Romulans would've 			done in their place!	Sisko glares at him, but it's clear that he sees the 	logic of what Garak's saying, as much as he doesn't 	like to hear it.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "In the Pale... " - REV. 2/11/98 - ACT FIVE    53.45   CONTINUED:	(3)					GARAK				(continuing) 			That is why you came to me, isn't 			it, captain? Because you knew I 			could do the things you weren't 			capable of doing yourself? Well, 			it worked. And you'll get what 			you wanted -- a war between the 			Romulans and the Dominion. If 			your conscience is bothering you, 			you should soothe it with the 			knowledge that you may have just 			saved the entire Alpha Quadrant. 			And all it cost was the life of 			one Romulan senator, one criminal, 			and the self-respect of one 			Starfleet Officer. I don't know 			about you, but I'd call that a 			bargain.									CUT TO:46   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS	Sisko is toying with a full glass of scotch.					SISKO 			This morning, at oh-eight-hundred 			hours, station time... the Romulan 			Empire formally declared war 			against the Dominion.

There's 			even a "Welcome to the Fight" 			party in the wardroom tonight.				(beat) 			I lied. I cheated. I bribed men 			to cover up the crimes of other 			men.
