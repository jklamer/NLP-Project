REPLIMAT	DAX is sitting at one of the tables, nursing a drink, looking 	a little bored.  QUARK comes up and sits down without waiting 	for an invitation.					QUARK			Why don't you tell your Uncle Quark 			all about it?					DAX				(grumpy)			What are you talking about, Quark?					QUARK			You're fifteen minutes late for your 			appointment in the holosuites, and 			from the look of that drink, you've 			been nursing it for a while.  You got 			stood up, didn't you?					DAX			If you must know... I'm waiting for 			Major Kira.  We were supposed to go 			anti-grav sailing together... But 			you know how she feels about the 			holosuites.	Before Quark can answer...            DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - 08/19/94 - TEASER            2.2    NEW ANGLE	KIRA speaks up... having ENTERED during the preceding 	conversation.					KIRA			She thinks they're a complete waste 			of time.	Quark and Dax turn toward Kira.					KIRA				(continues)			Anything worth doing in a holosuite 			can be done better in the real world.					QUARK			You've obviously never been in the 			right holosuite program.				(sidles up to her)			If you'd like, I could...					KIRA				(cuts him off)			You could.  But you'd live to regret 			it.	Quark deflates, his pride hurt.					QUARK				(extricating himself)			Maybe some other time.	Quark EXITS.					KIRA			Sorry I'm late.  Sisko and I had to 			revise the crew rotations again.					DAX			You mean you're not canceling?         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - TEASER          3.2    CONTINUED:					KIRA			No... I'm kind of looking forward to 			it.  Except for the crashing part.	Dax gets up.  She's glad she's finally getting Kira to relax 	and have some fun.					DAX			Don't worry.  You won't crash.  We'll 			start with an easy simulation... 			like sailing across the Great Erg on 			New Mecca.				(excited)			You'll see... this'll be terrific.	Dax and Kira start toward the holosuites, but...					N.D. COM VOICE			Ops to Major Kira.					KIRA				(to com)			Kira here.					N.D. COM VOICE			You have an incoming communication 			from the Bajoran Central Archives.	Kira would like to ignore it, but duty calls.					KIRA				(to com)			I'm in the Replimat.  I'll take it 			down here.				(to Dax, apologetic)			This'll only take a minute.3    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Kira walks up to a monitor on one of the walls of the 	Replimat.  She activates it and the image of ARCHIVIST ALENIS 	GREM appears.  Alenis is an older, professorial Bajoran woman, 	someone more comfortable with books and data than people.            DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - 08/19/94 - TEASER            4.3    CONTINUED:					KIRA			This is Major Kira.					ALENIS				(on monitor)			Major... My name is Alenis Grem.  			I'm doing a study on the Elemspur 			Detention Center for the Bajoran 			Central Archives and I was hoping to 			ask you a few questions.					KIRA			I'd be glad to help...				(curious)			But why come to me?  I was never at 			Elemspur.					ALENIS				(on monitor, puzzled)			Cardassian records clearly indicate 			that a Kira Nerys was held at Elemspur 			for...				(checks her records)			Seven days.					KIRA			Sorry, but you've got the wrong Kira 			Nerys.  Believe me, if I'd been held 			in a Cardassian prison, I'd remember.					ALENIS				(on monitor)			I don't understand.  I have the 			records right here.  Kira Nerys of 			Dahkur Province... Member of the 			Shaakar Resistance Cell...	On the monitor, Alenis operates some computer controls and 	an image comes up on the screen.4    CLOSE ON THE MONITOR (OPTICAL)	The image changes to display a "mug shot" of a young Kira 	wearing fatigues and looking miserable.					ALENIS				(on monitor)			You see?            DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - 08/19/94 - TEASER            5.5    ANGLE ON DAX AND KIRA	As they react to the picture of Kira.					DAX				(surprised)			It's you.	Kira looks dumbfounded at the mug shot and we...	PULL BACK TO REVEAL:6    FEMALE ALIEN	Standing on the other side of the Promenade, spying on Kira.  	Hold on the Alien Woman (YTEPPA) as she surreptitiously 	observes Kira's reaction, then...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                     DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - 08/19/94 - ACT ONE            6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)7    INT. SECURITY OFFICE (OPTICAL)	Kira and ODO are looking at the detention center records 	provided by Alenis.  In addition to the mug shot, the records 	display Okudagrams of Kira's genetic "fingerprint."  A graphic 	reads "Pattern Match."					ODO				(awkward)			If your memory and these prison 			records don't agree, then one of 			them must be wrong... Either the 			records... or...	Kira sees what Odo's getting at, and she doesn't like it.					KIRA				(confident)			My memory's fine.  I know exactly 			where I was that week.					ODO				(doubtful)			After ten years?					KIRA			I spent that whole winter with my 			Resistance group in the Dahkur Hills.         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT ONE         7.7    CONTINUED:					KIRA			We had no power cells for our phasers, 			almost no food, and we spent most of 			our time in caves hiding from 			Cardassian sensor sweeps.  Believe 			me, it was very... memorable.	She looks at the prison records once again.					KIRA				(continuing)			These records are fake.  The only 			question is who faked them... and 			why.	Odo nods, then turns his attention back to the monitor.					ODO			According to this, you supposedly 			shared a cell with three other 			inmates.  Maybe one of them can help 			us find out what's going on here...	Kira studies the monitor as Odo brings up the names of Kira's 	cellmates.8    INT. OPS (OPTICAL)	Kira is talking on a monitor to a Bajoran man in his late 	forties.  The man's name is YELN.  From his expression, the 	mention of Elemspur seems to have brought up painful memories.					YELN				(on monitor)			Elemspur... I haven't thought about 			that place in a long time.         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT ONE         8.8    CONTINUED:					KIRA			I was hoping you could answer some 			questions about your fellow prisoners.					YELN				(on monitor)			I'll try and...				(Yeln stops and stares 				at Kira)			Wait... I remember you... You were 			there, too, weren't you?				(remembers)			Kiri something?	Kira is stunned that Yeln remembers her, since she has no 	recollection of ever meeting him.					KIRA			Kira.  Kira Nerys.					YELN				(on monitor)			I almost didn't recognize you.  You 			used to wear your hair differently, 			didn't you?  Longer?					KIRA				(surprised)			You remember me... after all this 			time?					YELN				(on monitor)			When the Cardassians dragged you out 			of our cell, I gave you up for dead.  			Glad to see I was wrong.				(grim)			Those were bad times.         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT ONE         9.8    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA				(quiet)			Yes... they were.	As Yeln falls silent, Kira mulls the implications of what 	he's told her.9    INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR	Kira and SISKO walk together toward an airlock.  Kira's 	carrying a travel bag and seems worried.  Sisko is 	sympathetic.					SISKO			He could've been lying.					KIRA			Maybe.  But the records and the only 			surviving witness both say I was at 			Elemspur; my memory says something 			different.				(very worried)			I have to find out the truth.	Kira's clearly disturbed by this.  And maybe even a little 	afraid.					SISKO			I understand.  If there's anything 			you need...	Kira musters a smile of appreciation.					KIRA			I'll let you know.				(trying to be upbeat)			This shouldn't take long.  I'll only 			be on Bajor for a few days.					SISKO				(with affection)			We'll try to manage without you until 			you get back.	Kira smiles, then turns and leaves, EXITING into the Airlock.         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT ONE        10.10   CLOSE ON SISKO	As he watches her go.  He's concerned, but he knows Kira can 	handle herself.  After a beat, he heads back to Ops.  But as 	Sisko walks away...11   NEW ANGLE	Yteppa, the alien woman who was watching Kira on the 	Promenade, walks past him and follows Kira into the airlock.12   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.13   INT. REPLIMAT	GARAK is sitting at a table pouring himself a honey-like 	Cardassian drink when BASHIR joins him.					BASHIR			There you are, Garak.  I came by 			your shop, but it was closed.					GARAK			Business has been a bit slow... For 			some reason, living under the constant 			threat of Dominion attack has made 			people less eager to invest in new 			clothing.				(changing the subject)			How was your trip to Klaestron Four?					BASHIR			Terrific.  The Klaestrons have 			developed a burn treatment technology 			that has to be seen to be believed.         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT ONE        11.13   CONTINUED:					GARAK			You know... I envy you.					BASHIR			How so?					GARAK			When I was young, traveling was 			something of a hobby for me.  There 			are few things in life that compare 			with the thrill of immersing oneself 			in the culture of an alien world, 			meeting the inhabitants, earning 			their trust.  But aside from our one 			brief excursion to Bajor, I don't 			think I've been off this station for 			almost three years.					BASHIR			What's stopping you?  Ships leave 			Deep Space Nine almost every day.					GARAK			Space is dangerous, doctor.  You 			never know what might happen.					BASHIR			Garak, you're being paranoid.	Garak just stares at him.  Bashir reaches a realization.         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT ONE        12.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR			Are you saying that the Cardassian 			government would have you killed if 			you left this station?	This is exactly what Garak's saying, but he's not about to 	admit that to Bashir.					GARAK			My dear doctor... you do have a vivid 			imagination.				(smiles)			Now please... I want to hear all 			about your trip to Klaestron Four.	Bashir decides not to press it and settles in to relate the 	details of his trip.14   INT. OPS	Sisko and Dax are in Ops, along with a number of 	supernumeraries.					DAX			Commander, we're receiving a 			transmission from the Bajoran Central 			Archives...					SISKO			I'll take it.15   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As Sisko moves over to a monitor and Alenis Grem appears.					SISKO			If you're looking for Major Kira, 			I'm afraid she isn't on the station 			right now.  She's on Bajor.					ALENIS				(on monitor)			I know.  That's why I called.  The 			Major contacted me before she left.  			She was supposed to meet with me so 			I could show her the information I 			retrieved from Elemspur.				(a beat)			She never came.         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT ONE        13.15   CONTINUED:	Sisko's immediately concerned.  Dax, who's been 	eavesdropping, joins him.  She looks worried, too.					ALENIS				(on monitor)			I tried to contact the Major to 			reschedule... but she wasn't where 			she said she'd be... As far as I can 			tell no one's seen her since she 			left the spaceport for Elemspur.	And as Dax and Sisko exchange worried looks...									CUT TO:16   INT. GHEMOR'S HOME - ILIANA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	This is obviously a woman's bedroom.  Wall hangings and other 	decorations soften the stark architecture.  Though we may 	not realize it right away, the architecture is Cardassian, 	as are the decorations and various knickknacks in the room.  	A window looks out over a forboding Orwellian city.	There are three people in the room.  Yteppa (the female 	alien), a man standing in the shadows by the door, who we 	will come to know as CORBIN ENTEK, and an unconscious woman 	lying on the bed.  The woman's face is in the shadows.					ENTEK				(in shadow)			Wake her.	Yteppa administers a hypospray to the unconscious woman.        DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - 08/19/94 - ACT ONE 14-15.          17   NEW ANGLE	As the woman regains consciousness, we see things through 	her P.O.V.  She looks up at Yteppa.					KIRA'S VOICE				(groggy)			Where... where am I?	From the voice, it's clear the woman is Kira, although we 	still don't see her face.					YTEPPA			It's all right.  You're safe.	Kira sits up and the room comes slowly into focus as 	she tries to get her bearings.  Something catches her 	eye in the background.18   MIRROR	Behind Yteppa reflects the scene.  Kira stares at the mirror, 	and she and the audience both finally see...19   HER FACE	In place of her Bajoran nose, Kira now has an instantly 	recognizable pattern of bony ridges.  Her complexion has a 	gray cast, her face is skull-like.  Kira is now a Cardassian.					KIRA			What have you done to me?20   NEW ANGLE	As Entek steps forward from the shadows and we see that he 	is also a Cardassian.					ENTEK				(matter-a-fact)			We've brought you back home... to 			Cardassia.	And as Kira reacts to this horrifying news, we...21   OMITTED									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                               DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT TWO 16-17.                                    ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:22   INT. GHEMOR'S HOME - ILIANA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	(CONTINUOUS)	Kira backs away from Yteppa and Entek.  She sizes up 	the situation, trying to decide whether to fight or try 	to run.  Entek moves toward Kira.  He's ambitious and 	hyper-alert; you get the feeling he's always thinking 	of at least three different things at the same time.					ENTEK			Please... we're here to help you.	Kira doesn't believe that for a second.					KIRA			I don't know who you are... or what 			you're trying to do... but it's not 			going to work.  Whatever you think--				(indicates her face)			This is going to get you, you can 			forget it.					ENTEK			We don't think it's going to "get 			us" anything.  If all we wanted was 			information, we'd have it by now.					KIRA			Then what's stopping you?					ENTEK				(patiently)			We have no intention of hurting you.  			Why should we?  You're one of us.	Kira reacts angrily.					KIRA			This is absurd.  You can mutilate 			me, change my appearance, but you're 			never going to convince me I'm a 			Cardassian.					ENTEK			I know this is difficult for you.  			And I'm sorry.  I wish there was a 			better way to prepare you for what 			you're going through.         DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/23/94 - ACT TWO        18.22   CONTINUED:	As he's talking, Entek picks up a Cardassian picture frame 	off the desk and casually examines the picture inside.					ENTEK				(continues)			Sometimes I question the wisdom of 			our infiltration methods.  By altering 			the memories of our long-term 			operatives, we ensure that they'll 			never be discovered.

Other departing passengers walk by 	them.        DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - REV. 08/22/94 - ACT FIVE        62.82   CONTINUED:	(2)	One or two might even look askance at a Bajoran and a 	Cardassian speaking in friendly terms, but Kira and Ghemor 	pay no attention.					GHEMOR			One more thing, before I leave... 			Can I give you some fatherly advice, 			for old times sake?					KIRA			Of course.	Ghemor smiles, then gets deadly serious.					GHEMOR			This Garak fellow who helped you... 			helped us... Don't trust him, Nerys.  			Ever.  He's a dangerous man and he'd 			betray you and all your friends in 			an instant if he thought it would 			help him.					KIRA			I'll keep an eye on him.	Ghemor looks back at the airlock.					GHEMOR			I suppose it's time to go.	Kira nods.  She takes Ghemor's hand and places something 	inside it.					KIRA			Here.	Ghemor looks down at his hand.  Kira's given him back his 	wife's bracelet.					KIRA			It doesn't belong to me.  I can't 			keep it.	Ghemor looks at the bracelet for a beat then places it back 	in her hand.					GHEMOR			No.  I want you to have it.				(still gently holding 				her hand)			You may not be my daughter, but until 			I find Iliana, you're the closest 			thing I have to family.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Skin" - 08/19/94 - ACT FIVE          63.82   CONTINUED:	(3)	Ghemor starts to let go of Kira's hand so he can leave, 	but Kira holds his hand for a beat longer.					KIRA			I want you to know... that... despite 			what I might have said before... I 			realize now that you're an honorable 			man.  And I think your daughter 			must've loved you very much.	Ghemor smiles.  Kira and he look at each other for a long 	beat, then they let go of each other's hands and Ghemor slowly 	climbs the stairs into the airlock.83   CLOSE ON KIRA	As she watches the airlock door close behind Ghemor.  After 	he's gone, she looks down at the bracelet and holds it tight 	in her hand.	Hold on Kira for a beat, alone in the corridor, then...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
