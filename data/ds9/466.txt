ODO and QUARK stand before him.					ODO			I found twenty-seven voles in his 			storeroom.					QUARK			Vole infestations are not uncommon 			on this station.  If you don't believe 			me, ask Chief O'Brien.					ODO			When I came in, he and Morn were 			painting numbers on the voles' backs.					QUARK			We were just... counting them to see 			how many we'd caught.					SISKO			You were getting ready to stage a 			vole fight.       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/10/95 - TEASER        2.2  CONTINUED:					QUARK				(feigns surprise)			A vole fight?  I'm appalled.				(to Odo)			Do you really think that was what 			Morn was up to?					SISKO				(to Odo)			I want the voles confiscated and 			removed from the station.					QUARK			But you can't confiscate Morn's voles.  			They're like... his pets.	Sisko knows this is nonsense.  He stands up.					SISKO			I'll see if I can get him some 			goldfish.  And now, if you gentlemen 			will excuse me, it's late.	Sisko EXITS.  They follow behind.					QUARK			Poor Morn.  This is going to break 			his hearts.3    OMITTED 4    INT. OPS	Sisko comes down the stairs and turns to an N.D. Starfleet 	Officer.					SISKO			Ops is yours, Lieutenant.	The Lieutenant nods.  Just then, O'BRIEN ENTERS from the 	Turbolift, dressed like he was in the Mirror universe.          DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - TEASER          3.4  CONTINUED:					SISKO				(re: the clothes)			Going somewhere, Chief?	O'Brien stares at Sisko, Odo, and Quark with curious 	intensity.					O'BRIEN			Sir, I need to talk to you.				(eyeing Odo and Quark)			It's kind of private.					ODO			We were just leaving.				(to Quark)			Come on, let's go break the news to 			Morn.	Odo and Quark EXIT out a door.  O'Brien looks at them 	strangely.					SISKO				(to O'Brien)			Do you want to talk in my office?					O'BRIEN			Actually, I thought we'd go to my 			place.	O'Brien draws a phaser and shoves it under Sisko's neck.					O'BRIEN			Get onto the transporter pad...				(with an edge)			Now.	The Ops N.D.s are caught by surprise.					SISKO			What do you think you're doing?					O'BRIEN			Just get on the pad.	O'Brien prods Sisko toward the transporter.  Sisko coolly 	steps up onto the pad.  It doesn't seem like the time to 	argue.5    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Keeping his phaser trained on Sisko, O'Brien goes to Dax's 	station.  He runs a device over the console, then programs 	in a quick sequence of transporter commands.          DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - TEASER          4.5  CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Computer, energize on my command.	Never taking his phaser off Sisko, O'Brien steps up to the 	transporter and plays the (TECH) device over the base, then 	joins Sisko on the pad.					O'BRIEN			Energize.	They beam out.6    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	With a ship very similar to the Maquis raider we saw in the 	Voyager pilot.7    INT. RAIDER - TRANSPORTER AREA (OPTICAL)	A small transporter alcove like the one on the Defiant, but 	less "Starfleet clean."  Sisko and O'Brien beam in.	Sisko takes stock of his surroundings.					SISKO			Where are we?					O'BRIEN			I guess you might say we just stepped 			through the looking glass.	And as Sisko reacts to this, we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 DEEP SPACE: "Through...

RAIDER - QUARTERS	The doors open and Sisko ENTERS, followed by the Mirror 	O'Brien, who is still holding a phaser on him.					O'BRIEN			Why don't you sit down... make 			yourself comfortable?					SISKO				(re: the phaser)			Maybe I'm not feeling too comfortable 			right now.	Sisko turns his back to O'Brien to sit down.  O'Brien relaxes 	for a moment.  Suddenly Sisko pivots back to face O'Brien, 	knocking the phaser away with his forearm, and with his other 	hand clipping O'Brien on the jaw.  As O'Brien hits the wall, 	Sisko wrests the phaser away and turns it on O'Brien.					SISKO			There, that's better.	But to Sisko's surprise, O'Brien smiles as if Sisko's action 	has been somehow reassuring to him.					O'BRIEN			That was a pretty good move.					SISKO			I'm glad you liked it.					O'BRIEN			But it still doesn't change anything.  			You can't go home unless I reconfigure 			the transporter, and I'm not about 			to do that.				(off Sisko's reaction)			I guess you've got a lot of questions.					SISKO			Not as many as you think.					O'BRIEN			You know where we are?         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         5A.8  CONTINUED:					SISKO			If I had to guess, I'd say this is 			the same parallel universe that two 			of my crewmembers visited a year 			ago.					O'BRIEN			You're quick.  Just like our Sisko.         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE          6.8  CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)			That saves me having to give you a 			history lesson.				(a beat)			But I'd better update you on current 			events.  Since your officers left, 			we've started a rebellion against 			the Klingon/Cardassian Alliance.  			We're fighting for our lives.					SISKO			I wish you luck, but I don't see 			what that has to do with me.					O'BRIEN			It has everything to do with you.  			You were the leader of the Terran 			Rebellion.  At least, our Benjamin 			Sisko was.					SISKO			Was?					O'BRIEN			Captain Sisko's dead.  The Cardassians 			blew up his ship.	Sisko doesn't need to have a picture drawn for him.					SISKO			And you want me to take his place.					O'BRIEN			Like I said, you're quick.					SISKO			Well I've got a better idea.  We're 			going to walk back to the transporter 			pad and you're going to send me home.					O'BRIEN			Wait.  Hear me out.  I'm not asking 			for a lifetime commitment.  I just 			need you to finish the mission Sisko 			was on when he was killed.					SISKO			I'm sorry, but you're going to have 			to find someone else.  I don't belong 			here and I'm not about to interfere 			with events in this universe.         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE          7.8  CONTINUED:	(3)					O'BRIEN			At least let me tell you about the 			mission.  And then if you decide you 			don't want to help, I'll send you 			home.	Sisko nods.					O'BRIEN			There's a Terran scientist working 			for the Alliance.  According to our 			sources, she's close to completing a 			new transpectral sensor array that 			will allow the Alliance to locate 			our bases in the Badlands.  Without 			a safe place to hide, the Alliance 			will be able to track us down and 			kill us all.					SISKO			So you want me to make sure this 			scientist never finishes her project.         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE          8.8  CONTINUED:	(4)					O'BRIEN			Captain Sisko was convinced he could 			change her mind, get her to work for 			us instead.					SISKO			How did he plan to do that?					O'BRIEN			She was his wife.	Off Sisko's surprised reaction, O'Brien hands Sisko a battered 	PHOTO.9    NEW ANGLE	To include the PHOTO, a passport style shot of the Terran 	Scientist.  It's JENNIFER SISKO.					SISKO			Jennifer.					O'BRIEN			You know her?					SISKO			She was my wife, too.  But in my 			universe, she's dead.					O'BRIEN			Not here she isn't.  Not yet, anyway.					SISKO			What do you mean "not yet?"					O'BRIEN			If you don't convince Professor Sisko 			to join our cause, we'll have no 			choice but to kill her.					SISKO			Kill her?					O'BRIEN			We can't allow her to finish the 			sensor array.  It'd mean the end of 			the rebellion.	Sisko reacts, looking down at Jennifer's picture.  After a 	long beat, Sisko finally responds, never taking his eyes off 	the picture.         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         8A.9  CONTINUED:					SISKO			I can't let her die.  Not again.					O'BRIEN			You're the only one who can save 			her.	Sisko finally looks up at O'Brien.  And off this moment...10   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	Terok Nor (the Mirror Universe's equivalent of Deep Space 	Nine) in orbit around Bajor.       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/08/95 - ACT ONE       9.11   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS	The mirror KIRA is lounging on floor cushions, her back 	cradled against the muscular chest of a handsome young Terran 	slave.  Her Vulcan Eunuchs fan her while the slave feeds 	her delicate morsels of food with his hands.  A second slave, 	this one female, is sitting on the other side of her, holding 	a bowl of food.					KIRA			Delectable.	Kira slowly turns her head and the female slave reaches out 	and delicately wipes Kira's lips with a napkin.  Kira gives 	her a soulful smile.					KIRA			And so are you.	But before Kira can elaborate, the door chimes.  Kira's been 	expecting this.  She smiles.					KIRA			Enter.	The door opens and...12   NEW ANGLE	A Terran woman ENTERS.  It's Sisko's wife, JENNIFER.  She's 	dressed severely and has a solemn, taciturn disposition.					JENNIFER			Mister Garak said you wanted to see 			me?					KIRA			That's right... Come... join us.       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/08/95 - ACT ONE      10.12  CONTINUED:	But Jennifer stays where she is.					JENNIFER			If you're wondering when the new 			sensor array will be finished, the 			answer is--					KIRA				(finishing for her)			As soon as possible.  I know.					JENNIFER			Will that be all?				(off Kira's reaction)			I have to get back to work.	Kira stands up and approaches Jennifer.					KIRA			I have news about your husband.					JENNIFER			Nothing you could tell me about Ben 			would interest me.  I haven't even 			seen him in five years.					KIRA			I know that.  And I hope that will 			make this easier for you.  You see... 			Benjamin is dead.	Jennifer betrays no feeling whatsoever.					JENNIFER			Can I go now?					KIRA			You must've loved him very much to 			be so angry with him.  To have 			become... so cold.       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/08/95 - ACT ONE      11.12  CONTINUED:	(2)					JENNIFER			Were other Terrans killed with him?					KIRA			A whole ship full.	Now we see a sense of sadness in Jennifer.					JENNIFER			All this killing.  It has to stop.					KIRA			And it will.  As soon as you complete 			your transpectral sensors.  Once we 			locate the rebel bases, we can disarm 			them and put an end to all this 			bloodshed.  And I can resume pressing 			the Alliance to be more reasonable 			to its Terran population.	Jennifer clearly doesn't have much hope for that, but ending 	the Rebellion is reason enough for her to continue her 	project.					KIRA				(continuing)			You do believe me, don't you?	Kira smiles warmly at Jennifer.13   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	The Raider maneuvers through a Badland plasma storm.14   INT. RAIDER - CORRIDOR	The Mirror O'Brien escorts Sisko back to the transporter.  	Sisko is now dressed like his Mirror Universe counterpart.  	They pass some crewmembers, who salute him.         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         12.14  CONTINUED:					SISKO			So it's agreed.  I help you get 			Jennifer away from the Alliance, 			then you send me home.					O'BRIEN			You get us Jennifer and we'll do 			anything you want.  I just hope you 			can convince her to leave Terok Nor.					SISKO			I don't understand what she's doing 			helping the Alliance in the first 			place.  I mean, didn't she know Sisko 			was leading the Rebellion?					O'BRIEN			Oh, she knew.				(a beat)			The truth is... She and Captain Sisko 			didn't get along too well.  But then 			again, the captain didn't really get 			along with anyone.15   NEW ANGLE	They reach the transporter pad.					O'BRIEN			In some ways I think the rebellion's 			better off without him.  Don't get 			me wrong, the captain knew how to 			fight... but that's about all he 			knew.	O'Brien sets up the transporter.					O'BRIEN			Ready?         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         13.15  CONTINUED:					SISKO			You don't look very confident, 			Chief...					O'BRIEN			You better start calling me Smiley.  			That's what the Captain called me.					SISKO			All right... "Smiley."					O'BRIEN			I just wish we had more time to get 			you ready.  I probably haven't told 			you half of what you need to know.  			I hope you don't run up against too 			many surprises.	Sisko steps onto the transporter pad.					SISKO			If I do, I guess I'll just have to... 			improvise.	Sisko smiles.  O'Brien joins Sisko on the pad and they beam 	out.16   INT. CAVES - MAIN CHAMBER	The central meeting hall for Sisko's group of rebels.  There 	are a number of familiar faces in the crowd.  One or two 	supernumeraries we've seen before on Deep Space Nine, the 	scarred privateer from "CROSSOVER," and a hardened, heavily	armed professional soldier named ROM.	The rebels are in the middle of a vociferous argument, with 	one faction lead by JULIAN BASHIR and the other by TUVOK, 	the Vulcan from "VOYAGER."  They're a stark contrast in 	styles.  Tuvok is a coldly logical soldier, and Bashir's a 	hothead with a scruffy four days growth of beard and a 	permanent bad attitude.					BASHIR				(to all)			I told Sisko he'd never get close to 			Terok Nor, and I was right.       DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - REV. 02/03/95 - ACT ONE      14.16  CONTINUED:					ROM			I say we teach the Alliance a lesson.  			Throw everything we've got at Terok 			Nor and rip it to pieces.					TUVOK			I disagree.  Following your suggestion 			would do nothing to enhance our goals 			and would result in a significant 			loss of life.					ROM			That's easy for you to say.  Those 			Cardassian pigs didn't kill your 			brother.					TUVOK			We have all suffered losses at the 			hands of the Alliance.  Nonetheless, 			logic dictates caution in the face 			of a superior enemy.					ROM			Logic isn't going to win us our 			freedom.  We have to take action.					BASHIR			And we will.  But this time we do it 			my way.					TUVOK			And what do you propose we do?					BASHIR			We smuggle explosives on board the 			station, plant them in her quarters, 			and detonate them.					TUVOK			You realize it's highly unlikely 			that anyone assigned to such a mission 			would survive.					BASHIR			I say it's worth the risk.					SISKO (O.S.)			Does that mean you're volunteering 			for the job?	Rom, Tuvok, and the other Rebels turn in surprise at the 	sound of Sisko's voice.         DEEP SPACE: "Through... Glass" - 02/02/95 - ACT ONE         15.17   NEW ANGLE	To reveal Sisko, ENTERING with a swagger, flanked by O'Brien 	and Bashir.  The rebels react with surprise and happiness at 	Sisko's arrival.					REBELS				(ad lib)			Captain... You're back... Where have 			you been... Captain Sisko...					ROM			Captain, you're alive.	For a beat, Sisko's a little taken aback at seeing the mirror 	counterparts of Rom and Bashir.  O'Brien, seeing Sisko's 	hesitation, steps in.					O'BRIEN			Of course he's alive.  You can't 			kill the Captain.  He's too ornery 			to die.	Sisko picks up on O'Brien's cue and snaps into the Captain 	Sisko role.					SISKO				(re: Bashir)			I hope I haven't disappointed anyone.					BASHIR				(with some reluctance)			We're glad you're all right.					SISKO			I'm sure you are.					TUVOK			We heard your fighter had been 			destroyed.  The Alliance said you 			were dead.					SISKO			Just their propaganda machine, working 			overtime.  But you know what that 			tells me?				(smiles)			They're scared.	The smiles and affirmations from the crowd show that they 	agree with him.  Sisko's only been back a few seconds, and 	he's already got them in the palm of his hand.         DEEP SPACE: "Through...

Don't 			you see, you're no different than 			the slaves working in the Ore 			Processing Center.  In fact, you 			might be even worse off.

Freedom is a lot 			better than slavery.	Jennifer looks appraisingly at Sisko for a long beat, but 	she still can't come to a decision.					SISKO			Think about it.	Sisko presses a spot behind his ear, three times in rapid 	succession.					JENNIFER			What are you doing?					SISKO			Sending a message.					JENNIFER				(surprised)			You've got a subdermal communicator?					SISKO			Courtesy of the Ferengi.

As O'Brien passes close to the Overseer, 	he reaches behind his ear and touches the spot he was 	scratching earlier.  He smiles.					O'BRIEN				(to himself)			Took him long enough.	O'Brien moves to another part of the processing area.  Once 	he's out of sight of the Overseer, he goes to an access panel 	and pops it open.	O'Brien begins working on the circuitry inside the panel, 	when someone approaches him from behind.					CARDASSIAN OVERSEER			Terran, what are you doing down there?         DEEP SPACE: "Through...

Suddenly the lights short out, things explode 	inside the ore processing equipment and the doors open.  	The workers and the two Bajoran guards stand around, not 	sure what's happening.38   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As O'Brien grabs the Overseer's phaser and shoots one of the 	Bajoran guards.  That wakes the workers up.  They begin 	swarming over the last guard, rapidly overwhelming them.					O'BRIEN				(addressing the workers)			All right, anyone who wants to get 			out of here, follow me.	O'Brien heads for the door, and with a cheer, the Terran 	workers follow him.39   INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	Two Klingons stand guard in the corridor.  Suddenly the lights 	go down, and a half second later, the door opens and Sisko 	spins out.  The First Klingon barely has time to react before 	Sisko stops him cold with a one-two combination to the head.	The Second Klingon manages to draw his disruptor, but, before 	he can fire, Sisko retrieves the disruptor from the First 	Klingon and shoots the Second one.	As Jennifer ENTERS the corridor and looks at the unconscious 	Klingons, Sisko picks up the Second Klingon's disruptor.         DEEP SPACE: "Through...

Are you 			coming with me or not?					JENNIFER			Do I have a choice?					SISKO			Of course you do.  If you want, you 			can go back to your quarters and 			forget we ever spoke.	She hesitates.  Sisko presses.					SISKO			It's up to you.	Jennifer thinks for a moment longer, then walks over to him.					JENNIFER			All right, but lets get one thing 			clear.					SISKO			What's that?					JENNIFER				(with a smile)			I still hate you.					SISKO				(with regret)			I know.	They head off together down the corridor.40   OMITTED         DEEP SPACE: "Through...

Kira signals the Guards and they hold their 	fire.					KIRA			That was very clever, Benjamin, having 			one of your own men betray you so 			you could get aboard the station.  			You had me totally fooled.  Luckily 			Mister Garak is somewhat more cynical 			than I.					GARAK			Your Ferengi friend told us your 			entire plan... with a little 			persuasion.					KIRA			I'm afraid there's no escape.

ORE PROCESSING CENTER (OPTICAL)	Under heavy phaser fire, the Terrans retreat into the Ore 	Processing Room.  One of them gets hit in the doorway.  Sisko, 	the last man in, drags the wounded Terran to safety.					SISKO				(shouting, to O'Brien)			Smiley, seal the doors.	But the room is full of phaser fire and O'Brien's having a 	tough time staying alive, let alone reaching the door 	controls.					O'BRIEN				(to himself)			Easy for you to say.	But O'Brien makes a lunge for the controls and the doors 	begin to seal.  With one last burst of energy, Sisko manages 	to get the wounded Terran inside the Processing Center just 	as the doors close behind him.	Sisko joins Jennifer.					SISKO				(to Jennifer)			I'll get you out of this, I promise.					JENNIFER				(simply)			I believe you.	A moment passes between them.

In 			fact, he's been making a lot of sense.					KIRA			He can be persuasive when he wants 			to be.
