PROCESSING CENTER - NIGHT #3 - MOMENTS LATER	The tension in the room is palpable.  SISKO, BASHIR, B.C. 	and the TWO N.D. GHOSTS stand before LEE, BERNARDO and the 	THREE N.D. HOSTAGES who are lined up against the windows.	The Hostages are scared witless, expecting to be shot at any 	moment.  All the Ghosts are armed, and wear their trademark 	hats.	Outside, we hear the SOUND of the riot in progress -- people 	shouting, glass smashing, sirens, etc.  Through the barred 	windows we see INTERACTIVE LIGHT cast off by distant fires.  	The enormous SOUND of a helicopter passing overhead can be 	heard, and a SPOTLIGHT flickers across the window for a moment 	before moving on.	Bernardo is glancing around the room, as if looking for 	something.					B.C.			Hey, what are you looking at?					BERNARDO			Nothing...					B.C.			If you're looking for a way out, 			forget it --				(checks his badge)			... Bernardo -- you ain't going 			anywhere.				(to hostages)			None of you are.					LEE				(frightened)			What are you going to do with 			us... ?        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

Now sit down, 			all of you, over there.	B.C. indicates the counter.  The Hostages comply, settling 	onto the ground, their backs against the counter.  B.C. turns 	to one of the other ghosts.					B.C.			If any of them try anything, 			shoot'em.					SISKO			No one's shooting anyone.					B.C.			Maybe... maybe not...					SISKO			We need them alive.  They're the 			only thing we have to bargain with.					B.C.			You think I don't know that?					SISKO			Just making sure.	They hold each other's eyes for a beat... B.C. clearly doesn't 	like being challenged, and Sisko knows he's got his hands 	full with B.C. -- but he wants to avoid confrontation.  He 	starts for the windows.					SISKO			We'd better get these blinds 			closed.	Bashir reacts to B.C.'s questioning look.					BASHIR			The police could drop snipers onto 			those rooftops across the street and 			pick us off one by one.	B.C. sees their point, indicates the upturned benches that 	are strewn around the room.	B.C.	We can use those benches as a barricade.  Stack them up 	against the windows.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

When the blinds are 	closed --					B.C.			Too bad... I kind of like watching 			this place burn.2    NEW ANGLE	as VIN, Bernardo's partner, suddenly steps out of Lee's 	cubicle, PISTOL ready.					VIN			Drop your weapons.	B.C. and the other armed ghost are caught with their weapons 	at their sides -- neither makes a move to drop them.  Sisko 	is blocked from Vin's view by the wall of Lee's cubicle.	The moment hangs in the air, then B.C. breaks into a smile.  	Vin is a little thrown by this, nervously aims at B.C., then 	the other ghost... then back again.					VIN			What's so funny?					B.C.				(still grinning)			You... you're dead.	Suddenly Sisko makes his move, lunging forward and tackling 	Vin to the ground...	THE FOLLOWING EVENTS HAPPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY:	Sisko and Vin hit the floor and Vin's pistol goes skittering 	across the floor.	Lee lets out an involuntary scream of fear... B.C., his 	adrenaline flowing, swings his gun around and aims it at 	her.					B.C.			Shut up!	Which only makes her scream louder...					B.C.				(to Lee)			I said shut up!        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. II" - 10/31/94 - TEASER         4.2    CONTINUED:	As Sisko gets a grip on Vin and pulls him to his feet, 	Bashir steps forward to try and calm B.C. down.					BASHIR				(to B.C.)			Leave her alone, she's just scared.	He bends down to Lee...					BASHIR			Calm down, no one's going to hurt 			you.	Lee nods, trying to regain her composure... Bashir gives her 	a reassuring smile.  Sisko now has Vin on his feet, and the 	armed ghost has his weapon trained on him.					SISKO				(to Vin)			Get over there with the others.	Vin, a little shaken, seems to recognize Sisko from the other 	day.					VIN			I know you... I picked you up the 			other day.					SISKO			And this is my way of saying thank 			you.  Now get over there and sit 			down.	He shoves Vin toward the counter, and Vin takes a seat next 	to Bernardo.  B.C. seems genuinely impressed with Sisko... 	maybe he's not such a bad guy after all.					B.C.			Nice tackle, Bell.  Ever play 			football?					SISKO			Baseball, actually...					B.C.				(smiles)			I'd hate to be a catcher seeing you 			barreling toward the plate.	B.C. turns to Lee.					B.C.			You... on your feet.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. II" - 10/31/94 - TEASER         5.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					VIN			Leave her alone.	B.C. is taken aback by Vin's tone, but decides to go with 	it.					B.C.				(to Vin)			All right, Mouth, I will.  You get 			up.	Vin doesn't move.					B.C.			I said get up.					SISKO				(to B.C.)			What are you doing?					B.C.			Relax.  I just want to see what 			they're saying about us on the 			Net... I need his access number to 			log on.	Sisko nods, doesn't want to make an issue of it.  He's curious 	as well.					B.C.			Now don't make me ask you again.					VIN			Get lost.	After a tense beat, B.C. smiles.					B.C.			After you...	He starts to swing his gun around but Bernardo suddenly leaps 	to his feet.					BERNARDO			I'll do it.					VIN			What are you doing?  Sit down.					BERNARDO			Hey, Vin, we're not on duty now so 			don't give me orders.				(to B.C. and Sisko)			I just want to make it home in one 			piece.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

PROCESSING CENTER - NIGHT #3 (OPTICAL)	Sisko, Bashir, B.C. and Bernardo crowd around the Interface 	monitor behind the counter.  They're watching a news broadcast 	on the riot.					NEWSCASTER'S VOICE			National Guard units are mobilizing 			now and should reach Sanctuary 			District "A" within the hour.  			Governor Chen has issued a statement 			saying the uprising will be quelled 			and the Sanctuary District secured.  			It's still not clear how this riot 			began, though rumors of mounting 			tensions have been filtering out of 			the district for weeks.					B.C.				(during above)			This is great.  We're on every 			channel.  I bet they're even watching 			this in China.				(reacting to the 				reports)			What do they sound so surprised for?  			You treat people like animals, you 			get bit.	Suddenly there's a commotion by the door.  We see WEBB in 	the doorway, trying to push past a ghost.					WEBB			Let me through.					B.C.			Hey, who said you could come in 			here?					SISKO			It's okay.  Let him in.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

Webb has heard 	the rumors about hostages, and isn't happy when he sees 	they're true.  He's also surprised to see that Sisko and 	Bashir are involved.					B.C.				(to Bernardo)			You... join your friends.	Bernardo sits next to Vin, who frowns at him.  Sisko and 	Bashir take Webb aside to talk in private.  This takes them 	out of earshot of the Interface.					SISKO			I'm glad to see you're all right...					WEBB				(shakes his head)			So much for our peaceful 			demonstration...					SISKO			I know this isn't what we talked 			about... but it's what happened -- 			and now we have to deal with it.					WEBB			How?  It's a madhouse out there... 			and this building is crawling with 			ghosts.					SISKO			I know.  That's the first thing we 			have to fix.  I want you to go out 			and find some gimmies, people you 			know, people who can be trusted to 			help guard the hostages.					BASHIR			If we leave it to the ghosts, there's 			no telling what could happen.					WEBB			I think I know just the people you're 			looking for.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

In the 	background, B.C. bursts out laughing.					B.C.			Hey, Bell.  You're really missing 			something here.	Bashir and Sisko exchange a look and then walk toward the 	counter.6    INT. CHRIS BRYNNER'S OFFICE - NIGHT #3 (OPTICAL)	where DAX and CHRIS are watching the same broadcast on 	Chris's INTERFACE TERMINAL.  The Newscaster's VOICE 	provides the bridge between scenes.	Dax is shocked by the violence and the way it's being 	reported, and gravely concerned because she knows that Sisko 	and Bashir are trapped somewhere inside.  Chris is also 	clearly disturbed by what he's seeing.  He and Dax talk as 	the newscast continues.					NEWSCASTER'S VOICE			... Sanctuary Residents have looted 			the district's food distribution 			centers, and there are reports of at 			least a dozen fires.  Many of the 			district employees fleeing the riot 			have been reported injured and several 			have yet to be accounted for.  There's 			been no official count of injuries 			among Sanctuary residents, however 			satellite pictures show a number of 			possible casualties.					CHRIS			This is terrible.					DAX			I've got to get down there.					CHRIS			What are you talking about?					DAX			My friends are in there.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

You 			could get hurt.					DAX			Maybe.  But at least I'll have done 			something.  I just can't sit here, 			watching that place burn, knowing my 			friends are inside.					CHRIS			Listen... I have some friends in the 			police department.  When things settle 			down a little bit, I'll talk to them 			about--					DAX				(cuts him off)			I can't wait that long.  By the time 			things settle down, my friends could 			be hurt... or even killed.  They 			don't belong in there.  None of those 			people do.	Dax starts toward the door.					CHRIS			Jadzia, wait.	She turns back to him.					CHRIS			I'll come with you.				(turns off the 				Interface)			I guess I'm getting tired of just 			watching, too.	She nods and they EXIT together.7    EXT.

CREWMAN who was helping him in Part One.					O'BRIEN			According to our computer simulations, 			the degree of temporal displacement 			is directly proportional to the number 			of chroniton particles interacting 			with the transporter beam.  			Unfortunately, there's no way to 			know the exact concentration of 			particles at the time of the accident, 			but I've narrowed it down to ten 			possibilities, each one corresponding 			to a different time frame.  One of 			them has to be right.				(a beat)			We'll just have to hope we find the 			right one before we run out of 			chroniton particles.	KIRA ENTERS, also dressed in civilian clothing.  She's got a 	small gray bandage across the bridge of her nose, hiding her 	ridges.  She's not wearing her earring.					KIRA			I feel ridiculous.					ODO			Well, it does effectively disguise 			your Bajoran heritage.					O'BRIEN			If anyone asks, just say you broke 			your nose.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

We hear a 	blast of 30's-style JAZZ MUSIC for the brief moment the door 	was open -- they've just left a speakeasy.  The couple is 	laughing and having a good time, but stop short when they 	see our people.					O'BRIEN			Evening...	The couple just stare at Kira.

B.C. stands in the doorway, looking 	out at the Processing Center, where several gimmies have 	joined Bashir and the ghosts in guarding the hostages.	He turns back to Sisko and Webb.					B.C.			I've got one question for you two.  			What are all these Gimmies doing 			here?					WEBB			I asked them to help.					B.C.			And who invited you?					SISKO				(with authority)			I did.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

That means I get to decide 			who's on the guest list and who's 			not.					SISKO			We needed people we could trust in 			here.					B.C.			What's that supposed to mean?					SISKO			How many Ghosts do you know who you 			can really trust?					B.C.				(thinks it over for a 				beat)			One.  Me.  And that's enough.					SISKO			No, it isn't.  Not here.  Not now.					WEBB			Someone's got to guard the building, 			watch the exits.  Keep an eye on the 			hostages when we need to sleep.					B.C.				(fiddling with his hat)			Okay, okay.  You made your point.  			Just keep them out of my hair.					SISKO			The important thing is to decide 			what we're going to do with those 			hostages.					B.C.			You don't have to worry about 			that.  I've got it all figured 			out.					WEBB				(shaking his head)			I bet you do.					B.C.			And just to prove I'm not a bad 			guy, I'm going to let you two in 			on it.  It's simple.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. II" - REV. 11/02/94 - ACT ONE     15.10   CONTINUED:	(2)					B.C. (Cont'd)			We trade the hostages for our freedom.  			We get amnesty, a handful of credit 			chips, and a flight to... anywhere 			we want.

There're ten thousand 			people living in here.					B.C.			Yeah, well they can find their own 			hostages.					WEBB			No, Gabe is right.  This is an 			opportunity.  To make ourselves heard.  			To let people on the outside know 			what's going on in here.					SISKO			You want to make demands, I'll give 			you some demands.  We tell them if 			they want the hostages back, they've 			got to close down the Sanctuaries.					WEBB			That's right.  And reinstate the 			Federal Employment Act.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. II" - REV. 11/02/94 - ACT ONE     16.10   CONTINUED:	(3)					B.C.				(sarcastic)			Sounds good to me.  Why don't you 			have them throw in some silk shirts 			and a penthouse in Singapore while 			you're at it?				(a beat)			Jobs.  You guys want jobs?  When are 			you going to figure it out?  There 			are no jobs.  Not for us, anyway.					SISKO			They'll find us jobs.  They'll have 			to.
