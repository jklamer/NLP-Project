RUNABOUT	SISKO and DAX in the piloting seats, GARAK is getting 	something to drink out of a replicator, and ODO is 	sitting at a side console, lost in thought. Garak is 	grumbling.					GARAK			If I had known what I was walking 			into, I never would've gone.					DAX			It was your idea to attend the 			conference in the first place, 			Garak.					GARAK			I thought the Bajorans would be 			grateful to hear someone provide 			them with an opposing 			philosophical view.					DAX			"Opposing view?" Garak, you were 			trying to defend the military 			occupation of their world. How 			grateful did you think they would 			be?					GARAK			My understanding was that this 			conference was supposed to be an 			examination of the occupation from 			a dispassionate historical 			perspective.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					GARAK (Cont'd)			But instead, everyone went out of 			their way to dismiss virtually 			everything I had to say.					SISKO			I thought the Bajorans bent over 			backwards to be polite to you, 			Garak.					GARAK			Giving me a name tag that said, 			"Elim Garak -- Former Cardassian 			Oppressor" was hardly polite.					DAX			What did you want it to say? 			"Former Spy?"					GARAK			What I would've liked was less 			posturing and more debate. It's 			clear to me now that the Bajorans			aren't really interested in 			discovering historical truth 			so much as they are in promoting the 			myths and legends of the "glorious 			Resistance."					DAX			Odo wasn't a member of the 			Resistance and he attracted a fair 			amount of attention.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Odo stirs uncomfortably at this as Garak zeros in on him.					GARAK				(to Odo)			Yes, it seems you have quite a fan 			club on Bajor. I half expected 			you to be signing autographs at 			the end.					DAX			Don't let him get to you, Odo. 			You should be proud of what you 			did during the Occupation.					ODO			I have nothing to be proud of. I 			tried to... bring order to a 			chaotic situation, that's all.					SISKO			Give yourself some credit, 			Constable. Keeping order in the 			middle of the Occupation would be 			a tough job for anyone. But you 			not only did it -- you did it by 			earning the trust of both sides.					DAX			What was it the Moderator said? 				(remembering)			"You may have worked for the 			Cardassians, but your only master 			was Justice."					SISKO			And a legend is born.					GARAK			I may be ill.	Dax and Sisko exchange an amused glance, but Odo seems 	distinctly unamused by any of this.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - TEASER       4.2    CONTINUED:	(3)	We can see that something is troubling him just beneath	the surface									CUT TO:3    EXT.

Clear them for docking 			on Landing Pad One.					OKALA			Aye, sir.	Okala goes to work, then frowns at something on the 	monitor.					OKALA			Commander, something's wrong. 			They're not responding, and 			sensors show unusual EM signatures 			along their hull.	Worf quickly moves to the console.					OKALA				(off monitor)			The runabout's on auto-pilot...					WORF			Lifesigns?	Okala works.					OKALA			Four... very weak.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - TEASER       5.4    CONTINUED:					WORF				(urgent)			Disengage the auto-pilot and bring 			the ship to within transporter 			range.				(hits combadge)			Doctor Bashir to Transporter Room 			Five.

Dax, 	Garak and Odo are also unconscious. Worf makes a 	motion and the Guard EXITS to check out the aft part of 	the runabout as Bashir begins scanning Sisko.					WORF 				(to N.D.

TEROK NOR - PROMENADE GHETTO	As seen in "Necessary Evil." Sisko is sitting in the 	middle of Terok Nor with the Cardassian Occupation in 	full swing. Bajoran workers scurry back and forth, 	Cardassian soldiers keep watch on everyone... the mood is 	dark and grim. Odo, Garak and Dax are slumped 	unconscious against the bulkhead just a few feet away 	from Sisko and they're all wearing Bajoran miners' 	outfits.

TEROK NOR - PROMENADE GHETTO	Continuous from the Teaser. Sisko is trying to get his 	bearings, struggling to get to his feet, when a Bajoran 	named BELAR grabs him by the arm and yanks him to his 	feet.					BELAR				(roughly)			Show some dignity.	Sisko pulls away from the man instinctively, but has 	trouble with his balance and has to grab the bulkhead 	for support. Belar, a heavy-set thuggish man who seems 	to have a great deal of barely restrained rage, moves 	over and kicks Garak awake and begins rousting the 	other two.					BELAR				(to Garak)			Look at you -- no wonder the			Cardassians think we're animals.				(to Odo)			Get up! Get up!	Garak's instincts fairly propel him off the floor and 	is the first on his feet. Dax comes to and begins 	painfully getting to her feet, but Odo has real trouble 	shaking off the cobwebs and has to remain on all fours 	for a moment as he struggles to regain coherence.	Sisko tries to focus on Belar as his mind clears.					SISKO			Who... who are you?	Belar glances up at the upper level and sees a 	Cardassian Soldier watching them.					BELAR				(low, to Sisko)			If you're going to spend the night			taking chemicals, stay off the			Promenade. We don't need another			cleansing today.	Belar moves on without another glance at them.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE       8.10   ODO	is looking around the Promenade with a shocked and 	horrified expression.					ODO				(a whisper)			It can't be...11   NEW ANGLE	As Sisko looks up at the Cardassian Soldier on the 	upper level. The Soldier is watching them closely and 	Sisko knows that's not good.					DAX			What happened... ?					SISKO			Not here.	Garak's seen the Soldier also.					GARAK			I couldn't agree more.	Sisko and Garak each grab one of Odo's arms, lift him 	to his feet, and then the four of them move out and 	head down the Promenade. The Soldier watches them go, 	never taking his eyes off of them until they finally 	disappear around the bend.									CUT TO:12   INT. DEEP SPACE NINE - SURGERY	Sisko, Dax, Odo and Garak are lying on biobeds while 	Bashir scans them and N.D. Nurses attach small devices 	to their heads. Bashir is focused, trying to puzzle 	out the strange readings he's seeing.					BASHIR			There's a high level of neural 			activity... which suggests their 			conscious minds are active... but 			there's no response to any 			external stimuli.	Worf ENTERS.					BASHIR				(to Worf)			What's the word on the runabout?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE       9.12   CONTINUED:					WORF			We've found preliminary 			indications that the ship 			encountered a class two plasma 			storm which irradiated the vessel.	Bashir moves to a console.					BASHIR			Computer, are current neural 			readings for subjects Sisko, Odo, 			Dax and Garak consistent with the 			effects of encountering a class 			two plasma storm?					COMPUTER VOICE			There are no recorded causal 			relationships between plasma 			storms and specified neural 			readings. 					BASHIR			None? Computer, how many medical 			records are there on space plasma 			phenomena?	The computer screen begins scrolling with information.					COMPUTER VOICE			Five thousand, twenty-one.	Worf and Bashir exchange a look.					BASHIR			So we're dealing with a fairly 			common phenomenon, having an			uncommon effect on our people.					WORF			The runabout is still being 			analyzed. They may have more 			information soon. 					BASHIR			Good. In the meantime... I have 			some reading to do.	Bashir sits down at the computer monitor and begins 	reading the massive amount of files.									CUT TO:      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE      10.13   INT. TEROK NOR - PROMENADE GHETTO	Sisko, Dax, Garak and Odo come to a stop near an 	abandoned kiosk which is run-down, and looks as though 	it's been looted recently. They lean against the 	service counter for a moment and huddle for a moment to 	gauge the situation.					SISKO			This is Terok Nor... D.S. Nine 			during the occupation.					DAX			Time travel? 					GARAK			It's more than that. Our clothes 			have changed.					ODO				(desperate)			Could we be in a holosuite?					SISKO				(to the air)			Computer, end program.	Nothing happens.					SISKO			Let's assume that's a no for the 			moment.	Dax glances around for a moment at the Bajoran 	passersby who don't seem to notice them.

Garak 	notices something.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE -       13   CONTINUED:					GARAK			I should be getting some attention 			too... we're in the Bajoran 			sector... Cardassians weren't 			exactly welcome here.	He suddenly steps out in front of an N.D. Bajoran man 	walking along.					GARAK.				(arrogant)			Out of my way.	The man simply shoves Garak aside and moves on. Garak 	turns to the others, his mind racing.					GARAK			A Bajoran would never touch a 			Cardassian during the Occupation. 			At least, not publicly.					SISKO			I don't think they see you as a 			Cardassian. And I'm beginning to			think they don't see any of us 			as who we really are. 					GARAK			The clothes we're wearing are 			Bajoran... and they're treating 			us like Bajorans...					SISKO			Maybe they see us as Bajorans. 			Any theories, old man?					DAX				(reaching)			Some kind of... cross-dimensional 			transfer? Our conscious minds 			might've been moved through time 			and space into the bodies of four 			Bajorans on Terok Nor.					GARAK			But then why do we still see each 			other as we really are instead of 			as Bajorans?					DAX			I just ran out of speculation.	During all of the above, Odo is looking around and lost 	in a private nightmare that only he knows about.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE     11A.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			The last thing I remember was... 			sitting in the runabout...					DAX			There was a plasma anomaly on the 			sensors... and then I heard this 			sound...					GARAK			No, not a sound -- more like a 			strong vibration...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE     11A.13   CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO			I remember.

She 	looks away quickly.					DAX				(quiet)			Dukat's on the second level.	A murmur goes up from the crowd on the Promenade as 	people notice the station commander above them. Sisko 	looks up at the second level.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE     12A.14   SISKO'S POV	GUL DUKAT walks along the balcony, talking to a 	Cardassian named THRAX. He's an austere-looking man 	and he wears a uniform that seems neither fully 	civilian nor military, but some mixture of both.15   RESUME SCENE	Sisko casually starts moving away from this area.					SISKO			Let's move on.	The others wait for a second, and then one by one start 	following Sisko. Before he moves, Odo glances up at 	the second level...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE      13.16   ODO'S POV	Dukat and Thrax have paused on the balcony, and they're	staring right at Odo.17   ODO	Reacts in surprise, averts his gaze. Sisko and the 	others are now walking casually down the Promenade and 	only Odo is left by the kiosk. Trying to hold his 	breathing steady and appear natural, he begins to 	follow them... but with every step, he thinks he can 	feel those eyes boring into his back... finally he 	can't resist any longer and he glances back over his 	shoulder to see....18   ODO'S POV	Dukat and Thrax are talking again, and give no 	indication that there's anything down on the Promenade 	that they're interested in.19   ODO	walks into a Bajoran. He pulls up short and stares at 	the man with a shocked expression. The man is tall and 	thin, wearing a filthy mining outfit and later we'll 	learn his name is Timor Landi. At the moment, he 	simply looks at Odo with a dull, pathetic expression. 	There's a large PHASER BURN in the middle of his chest. 	His face is mottled and pale, his clothes decrepit. In 	short, he looks like a corpse.					SISKO'S VOICE				(low)			Odo.	Odo turns, sees Sisko and the others have gathered near 	an alcove. Odo turns back to Timor... but he's gone. 	After a confused beat, Odo rejoins his friends.					SISKO				(re: Thrax)			Who was that? 					ODO			I... don't know.					GARAK			You should. He was your 			predecessor.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE      14.19   CONTINUED:					ODO			My predecessor... ?				(realizing)			Oh. Yes. The man talking to 			Dukat. His name is Thrax. He was 			in charge of security on the 			Promenade before me.					DAX			Then that means we've gone back at 			least nine years.	Odo nods absently, his mind still haunted by the 	encounter with Timor. Two Cardassian SOLDIERS with 	phaser rifles suddenly appear at their side without 	warning.					SOLDIER				(to Dax)			You. Come with us.	Sisko immediately steps between the soldiers and Dax.					SISKO			What's she done?					SOLDIER			Nothing.				(with a smirk)			Yet. Come on.	He takes Dax by the arm, but now Garak joins Sisko.					GARAK			Perhaps there's been some 			misunderstanding. If I may be so 			bold -- you may find something 			which will bring you infinitely 			more profit than the arrest of a 			Bajoran woman.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT ONE      15.19   CONTINUED:	(2)	The two Soldiers exchange a look and hesitate for a 	moment.					SOLDIER			Latinum?					GARAK			Two strips.					SOLDIER			Where is it?					GARAK			Our friend is still in custody.	The Soldier seems to consider this for a moment... then 	looks up toward the second level and stiffens.20   ON DUKAT	who's up on the second level, watching them from a 	distance.21   THE SOLDIER	realizes he's on the spot and reacts by HITTING Garak 	in the face and dropping him. Sisko steps forward, but 	the second Soldier puts a hand on the butt of his 	weapon and Sisko pulls up short.					DAX				(to Sisko)			I'll be all right.					SOLDIER				(to Garak)			Tempting offer.

Dukat is sitting on the couch, looking 	over several PADDS when Dax and the Cardassian Soldier 	seen earlier ENTER. Dax tries to keep her eyes down 	and play the part of a Bajoran woman thrust into the 	office of the most powerful man on the station.					DUKAT			Name?	This puts her at something of a loss for a beat.					DAX			Leeta.					DUKAT			Look at me when I speak to you,			Leeta.	Dax looks up at him and Dukat examines her more closely 	for a beat. Then he silently indicates that she should 	spin around. Dax decides to go along and pirouettes willingly.					DUKAT			She'll do.	He dismisses the Soldier with a gesture, who then 	EXITS. Dukat simply stares at Dax for a moment, his 	eyes boring into her.					DUKAT			Kanar.	For a moment, Dax isn't sure what he meant... then 	decides it was a request.

She turns back to the 	sideboard, and begins pouring a second glass. Dax 	takes a deep breath, rolls her eyes and then decides to 	play the part to the hilt. She puts on her best "I'm 	really frightened to be here," look and heads for the 	couch with the two glasses of Kanar.					DUKAT				(taking his glass)			Have you ever had Kanar?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT TWO      24.30   CONTINUED:					DAX			No.					DUKAT			Then this is an occasion.	Dukat notes that her hand is trembling slightly.					DUKAT			Why, you're trembling.

TEROK NOR - QUARK'S	It's closing time and the customers are gone. Two 	Ferengi waiters are arguing over tips with the dabo 	girls. Quark is counting his receipts for the day at 	a table. Sisko, Odo and Garak are the janitorial 	crew. They're cleaning up spilled food and drinks, 	bussing tables, washing glasses, etc. Sisko is pouring 	some kind of cleaning fluid onto a rag as he works on 	polishing the bar. Garak manages to move his work over 	toward Sisko so they can talk while no one's paying 	them much attention. They keep their voices low and 	try to appear to still be working.					GARAK			I had no idea we were such messy 			conquerors. I remember the 			occupation as being a little more 			tidy than this.					SISKO			Everything's tidy when someone 			else is doing the cleaning. 					GARAK			The Bajorans were more suited to 			this sort of thing than we were. 			Servile work is in their nature.					SISKO			I'll be sure to mention that to 			Major Kira when we get back.					GARAK			There are exceptions to every 			rule.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT TWO      26.32   ODO	is carrying a tray of glassware and dishes over to the 	bar, when he looks up and sees...33   THREE BAJORANS	moving in SLOW-MOTION. One of them is Timor Landi 	again, and the other two we should recognize as the 	real Ishan Chaye and Jillur Gueta. All three of them 	are walking down the Promenade and together they turn 	and look through the window into Quark's, their eyes 	trained on Odo. They all look like corpses with 	prominent phaser burns on their chests, and it's a very 	unsettling sight.34   ODO	Almost drops the tray, but manages to recover and heads 	over to the end of the bar. Sisko moves to help him 	unload it. Garak manages to move his own cleaning work 	down to the end as well. Odo looks out the window 	again, but the three Bajorans are gone.					SISKO				(to Odo)			You all right?					ODO				(re: dirty dishes)			The smell's making me sick.	Sisko glances over at Quark for a second to make sure 	they're not being watched.					SISKO				(to Odo)			How did you know your name would 			be Timor Landi in this... whatever 			this is.	Odo hesitates for a moment, realizes he has to come up 	with an explanation.					ODO			I recognized the other two names 			from the security files kept 			during the Occupation.

Quark looks up and reacts with a long 	sigh -- he's not looking forward to another visit from 	the security chief. Thrax barely takes note of Sisko 	and the others, concentrating on Quark.					THRAX			Quark. I understand you had a 			visit from a Talavian freighter 			captain this morning. A Captain 			Livara, I believe.					QUARK			I had lots of visitors this 			morning. It was a busy day.					THRAX			I'm surprised you're being so 			indiscreet. Captain Livara is a 			known smuggler.					QUARK			You don't say? Such a nice,			friendly man, too. I guess you 			can never tell what some people 			are really like.					THRAX			Rumor has it that the Obsidian 			order's had him under surveillance 			for several months.	That changes things a little. Some of the bravado goes 	out of Quark's attitude.					QUARK			The Obsidian Order.					THRAX			Mm-hm. Rumor also has it that 			they're planning on bringing in 			all of Livara's co-conspirators 			for... "questioning."					QUARK			Well, you know how rumors are...     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT THREE     29.35   CONTINUED:					THRAX			Yes. They're usually true. So 			when the Order asks me for a list 			of Livara's known associates on 			the station...					QUARK			He was here ten minutes, he wanted 			to unload a shipment of maraji 			crystals, but I wasn't interested.	Thrax snorts with derision.					QUARK			I can't move maraji crystals. The 			Cardassians don't like them and 			the Bajorans can't afford them, so			I sent him on his way, all right?					THRAX			And that's all?					QUARK			That's all.					THRAX			I hope so. Because if I find out 			that you're dealing in illegal 			crystals, I'll hand you over to 			the Order myself.	With that, Thrax heads out the door.					QUARK				(calling after him)			Always a pleasure.36   ON THE BAR	Where Sisko, Garak and Odo are still working. Sisko 	and Garak took particular note of the Thrax/Quark 	interchange. Garak pulls out the comp-link and 	carefully works it without drawing attention to 	himself.					SISKO				(to Odo, re: Thrax)			I see you weren't the first man to 			keep Quark on his toes around 			here.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT THREE     30.36   CONTINUED:					ODO				(uncomfortable)			Yes.					GARAK			Something's wrong. Thrax was 			talking about a Captain Livara...					SISKO			That name mean something to you?					GARAK			Livara wasn't just another 			smuggler... he was a Romulan spy 			and he didn't begin working in 			this sector until seven years ago.			But seven years ago, Thrax wasn't 			on Terok Nor --				(to Odo)			-- you were. An odd 			contradiction.				(re: comlink)			So I checked the date. This is 			seven years ago. Thrax shouldn't 			be here. You should be the 			Security Chief.					ODO			None of this makes sense, Garak. 			Now I suggest we concentrate on 			finding a way out of here. 			That's our priority.					SISKO			I tend to agree.					GARAK			You'll get no argument from me -- 			the question is, how?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT THREE     31.36   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			We need to contact the Bajoran 			Resistance.

Odo picks up the tray and begins to head back to 	bus another table. Garak looks down at another plate 	of spilled food on the floor and resigns himself to the	distasteful work. As he bends down and begins 	cleaning...									CUT TO:37   INT. TEROK NOR - PROMENADE GHETTO	A short time later, Sisko, Odo and Garak pass through 	the gate under the watchful eye of the Cardassian Guard 	and enter the Bajoran sector again. They move through 	the teeming crowd of Bajorans and Sisko leads them to 	a ordinary kiosk with a few wares for sale and a 	Bajoran merchant haggling with a customer.	Sisko appears to look over the goods on the back shelf 	for a moment as Garak and Odo look on. Sisko picks up 	a Bajoran VASE from the top shelf and seems to examine 	it closely... he turns it over in his hands a few 	times... then puts it back on the upper shelf upside	down, and walks away.	Sisko leads Odo and Garak away through the crowd until 	they end up near the "Soup Kitchen" area. They each 	pay for bowls of soup from the counter (using the slips 	of latinum they presumably got from Quark) and sit 	down.					GARAK			The Bajorans never did have a 			sense of style.

The Commander of 			Terok Nor. Just another 			swaggering, self-important Gul 			with too much vanity and not 			enough ability.	Sisko glances up at the second level.					SISKO			Maybe. But he's no fool.40   ON THE SECOND LEVEL	Two armed Cardassian Guards discreetly prowl the upper 	level, their eyes watching the crowd and Dukat.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT THREE       41   ON DUKAT & DAX	As Dukat walks through the Bajoran sector with Dax. 	Dukat is playing the benevolent ruler walking among his 	subjects, unconcerned that there's no affection in 	their eyes.					DUKAT				(to Dax)			... on the contrary, I find these 			visits stimulating. Each time I 			come, I find another example of 			Bajorans making progress.					DAX			Progress.					DUKAT			For example, not that long ago 			you'd find them burning malaba 			drums on this level just to keep 			warm. Six months ago, I extended 			environmental controls into the 			Bajoran sector. And look -- no 			fires, no poor unfortunates 			shivering under blankets.	Dukat beams with pride, but Dax looks around at the 	unhappy, destitute crowd and sees little to be proud of.					DAX				(to herself)			Just a little malnutrition and 			lack of medical care.					DUKAT			Hmmm?					DAX			I didn't say anything.	Dukat heads over to a kiosk of goods. The Bajorans 	part in front of him.42   ON ODO	As he glances around the Promenade for a beat, then 	lifts his spoon to take a mouthful of soup -- but his 	hand is covered with blood. He looks down in shock -- 	both his hands are dripping with blood! He drops 	the spoon with a start.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT THREE     34.43   NEW ANGLE	Sisko and Garak turn at the sound of the spoon clanging 	on the metal to see Odo sitting there with a confused 	look on his face. The blood on his hands is gone.					SISKO			You all right?					ODO				(recovering)			Yes. Just... slipped out of my 			hand.	At this moment, Belar, the Bajoran who woke Sisko on 	the Promenade, takes a seat at their table. He has a 	bowl of soup and begins eating; he keeps his voice low 	and his eyes on the soup as he talks.					BELAR				(quiet)			You wanted a meeting...	Sisko and the others exchange glances -- Belar is with 	the Resistance.					BELAR				(annoyed)			Don't look at me, eat your soup.	They busy themselves with their bowls.

Now, I hate 			soup and I have no intention of 			eating this entire bowl, so 			whatever you want, let's hear it.					SISKO			We need to get off the station.						BELAR			Why? 					GARAK			Does it matter?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT THREE     35.43   CONTINUED:					BELAR			Yes, as a matter of fact, it does. 			We're not a commuter service.

TEROK NOR - HOLDING CELL	Odo, Sisko and Garak are in one of the holding cells. 	The other cells are overflowing with Bajoran Prisoners 	and there's a continuous babble of talk in the b.g. 	Garak looks out at the other prisoners with a 	disdainful eye, while Sisko is systematically checking 	over the cell walls on the off chance that he'll find 	a weakness. Odo is in a funk, staring down at the 	floor, lost in his own despair.					GARAK			You'd think they'd put us in our own 			cell block, instead of with 			the common criminals. After all, 			we're accused of attempting to 			assassinate the station commander. 			That deserves some respect.					SISKO			Maybe they'll salute when they 			execute us.	Thrax ENTERS the holding area, carrying a PADD and 	accompanied by two Cardassian Guards. The Bajoran 	prisoners immediately begin SHOUTING at him and trying 	to get his attention.					PRISONERS				(overlapping)			Please, listen to me!...

In the b.g. the Guards begin marching five 	Bajoran prisoners out of the cell and then EXITING out 	the door. Thrax maintains an air of calm, control, but 	he's a busy man, with enormous responsibilities and has 	little time to devote to any one case, even in an 	assassination attempt like the one confronting him now.	He looks over the PADD for a moment. In the cell, Odo 	avoids looking directly at Thrax, but we can tell he's 	listening to every word.					THRAX				(off PADD)			Timor, Ishan and Jillur. You 			came aboard the station two days 			ago from Rakantha Province... 			yesterday you visited the chemist 			shop, and then fell asleep on the 			Promenade... last night you were 			hired as a cleanup crew by the 			Ferengi... after being paid, you 			went back to the Sajoran sector 			and attempted to murder Gul Dukat 			with a chambered plasma grenade.					SISKO			We were sitting at a table eating 			when the grenade went off.

They keep shouting for 	help and for their special needs over and over again. 	It's a scene of pandemonium in the holding area and 	Thrax is clearly tired and overworked.					THRAX			There's sufficient evidence for a 			conviction.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT FOUR     41.49   CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO			It's all circumstantial -- look 			beneath the surface, conduct a 			real investigation!					THRAX				(by rote)			The investigation is over.

I need to talk to you! 			Let me talk to you alone for just 			a moment! Please, listen to me!	But Odo's voice is just one more desperate shout in a 	cacophony, and Thrax ignores it as he EXITS.									CUT TO:50   INT.

She's healing 	a cut on his temple, but Dukat isn't in the mood for 	any more treatment.					DUKAT			Enough.	He impatiently waves her away and the woman EXITS. As 	she does, we see Dax sitting behind the desk, eating a 	hearty meal and helping herself to a sizable glass of 	kanar. She's been treated as well, but there are still	few scratches and bruises on her face. Dukat grunts	little as he sits up, but then swallows the pain in 	front of Dax and forces himself to an upright position.					DAX			How do you feel?					DUKAT			Better than last time.					DAX			Last time?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT FOUR     42.50   CONTINUED:					DUKAT			This is the fourth assassination 			attempt I've survived.	He manages to stand with some difficulty.					DAX			Maybe you should find another job.	He looks at her sharply, but Dax gives him her most 	winsome smile and Dukat begins to think he's getting 	somewhere with this woman. He smiles back at her and 	almost chuckles.					DUKAT			Maybe I should.	She meets his gaze and holds it just long enough to let 	him know that she's interested and then returns to the 	food and drink. Dukat moves closer.					DUKAT			It's good to see you have your 			appetite back.					DAX			I don't get to eat like this very 			often.					DUKAT				(frustrated)			I've wanted to increase rations in 			the Bajoran sector for sometime, 			but the Resistance makes it almost 			impossible to show any sort of... 			kindness to your people.					DAX				(innocent)			You really want to help my people, 			don't you?					DUKAT			Of course.

DUKAT			Bad manners are the fault of the 			parent, not the child. My 			weakness is that I'm... too 			generous... too forgiving... my 			heart is too big.	Dax strikes viciously and quickly, hitting him in the 	back of the head in a single well-placed blow that puts	Dukat on the deck, unconscious, before he has time to	react.					DAX			So's your ego.	She moves to the computer monitor and begins quickly 	working the controls...									CUT TO:51   INT. TEROK NOR - HOLDING CELL	Odo has resumed his staring at the floor, his mood even 	darker than before.

When I ran a 			neurochemical scan of your brain, 			I found residual traces of 			morphogenic enzymes, which I've 			only detected before in changelings.					ODO				(off PADD)			The plasma storm that hit the 			runabout activated the enzymes and 			initiated a telepathic response.					BASHIR			Your mind reached out to find 			other changelings to form the 			Link, but it could only find Dax, 			Sisko and Garak.	Odo nods thoughtfully.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT FIVE     59.84   CONTINUED:					ODO			And just before the accident, I 			was thinking about the executions. 				(beat)			Somehow being in the Link must 			have forced me to relive it... to 			admit the truth of what I'd done.					BASHIR			It would make a fascinating paper. 				(off his look)			But I don't intend to write one.	Just then, the doors OPEN and KIRA ENTERS. She glances 	at Bashir, but she's clearly here to see Odo. Odo 	stands up behind the desk and Bashir picks up on the 	instant tension in the room.					BASHIR			If you have any questions... you 			know where to find me.	Bashir EXITS, leaving Odo to face Kira alone. More 	than just the desk is separating them now. There's a 	touch of anger in Kira, but mostly disappointment and 	pain, and a need to understand.					KIRA			When I finished reading your 			report... I didn't know what to 			think. So I said to myself, 			"That's okay Nerys, you're just 			stunned. You need to let this 			sink in a little." 				(beat)			But it's been two days, Odo, and 			I still don't know what to think.					ODO			I'm guilty. What more is there to 			say?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Things Past" - REV. 10/04/96 - ACT FIVE     60.84   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			Maybe nothing. Maybe a lot. I 			believed in you. A lot of people 			did. You were... special. The 			one man who stood apart from 			everyone else; the one man who 			stood for justice. Now what? 					ODO			Now I'm... just another imperfect 			solid.	A quiet moment as they both struggle with their 	feelings.					KIRA			Okay. The Prophets know I'm not 			perfect. And I guess the truth is 			that anyone who lived through the 			occupation had to get a little 			dirty. But I need to know that no 			other innocent people died on your 			watch, Odo... That this was the 			only time.	And this is perhaps the most difficult admission of 	all.					ODO			I'm not sure. I hope so.	Odo sits down at his desk. Kira looks at him for a 	moment, then she sits down too. As they absorb the 	terrible truth of that statement...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
