PROMENADE - FIRST FLOOR (ORB SEQUENCE)					(OPTICAL)			Late at night.  Both levels are 			completely deserted and the lights 			are low.  There's an eerie quality 			to the play of light and shadows on 			the Promenade floor.2    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	To reveal VEDEK BAREIL standing on the Promenade.  He looks 	warily around as if he's as surprised to be there as we are 	to see him.	Bareil begins walking cautiously down the center of the 	Promenade... intensely studying his surroundings as if the 	reason for his presence can be discovered in the shadows.3    CLOSE ON BAREIL (OPTICAL)	He walks toward us... curious now... He slows to a halt next 	to Quark's... looks around again... gradually turns in a 	complete circle...	Until he suddenly backs into something.  Bareil spins around 	and leaps away in sudden fear from...4    A HANGED MAN (OPTICAL)	Dangling from one of the crossover bridges in the Promenade.  	(We only see the body from the waist down.)5    CLOSE ON BAREIL (OPTICAL)	As he tries to regain his composure, but he is definitely 	rattled by this discovery.  And as he gazes up we see a look 	of recognition come over his face.	Just then, his attention is diverted by a strange rhythmic 	sound echoing through the Promenade.	Bareil looks for the source of the sound and sees...       DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/21/94 - TEASER       2.6    KIRA (OPTICAL)	Dressed in her workout clothing, playing Springball (Bajoran 	Handball) against a wall of the Promenade.  She looks over 	at Bareil with an enigmatic smile as if amused by his growing 	confusion.7    INCLUDE BAREIL (OPTICAL)					BAREIL			Nerys?					KIRA				(still playing)			Vedek Bareil.  Want to play?					BAREIL				(re: the hanged man)			Help me.  			Without stopping her game, Kira glances at the Hanged Man with 			as if there's nothing unusual about him.					BAREIL			Please.	Kira catches the springball in her hand, ending her little 	game.					KIRA			All right.8    NEW ANGLE - SECOND LEVEL (OPTICAL)	Kira is now on the second level standing by the railing which 	anchors the rope.  She uses an ornate Bajoran knife to 	offhandedly slice through the rope with one easy cut.9    ANGLE ON BAREIL (OPTICAL)	As the body collapses into his arms.  He looks down at the 	victim's face...10   CLOSE ON VICTIM (OPTICAL)	A male Bajoran monk, who we will eventually come to know as 	PRYLAR BEK.  There's no noose around Bek's neck and he looks 	peaceful in death.       DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/21/94 - TEASER       3.11   RESUME BAREIL (OPTICAL)	as he looks up at Kira, who walks over to him.					KIRA			Who is it?					BAREIL			It's Prylar Bek.	Kira looks down at the body and smiles.					KIRA			No it's not.12   CLOSE ON BAREIL (OPTICAL)	As he looks back down at the corpse in his arms and sees 	that he's now holding his own dead body.					KIRA				(amused)			It's you.	And as Bareil looks back at Kira in bewilderment...13   INT. TEMPLE SHRINE CHAMBER - NIGHT (OPTICAL)	Revealing that this has been an Orb experience.  On BAREIL, 	the blue glow of an Orb playing off his face and then 	subsiding as his vision ends (as in "The Circle").	Bareil close the doors to the ark that holds the Orb of 	Prophecy and Change.	Hold on Bareil, who is visibly troubled by the vision he has 	just experienced, and then...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/21/94 - ACT ONE       4.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)A14   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.  A Bajoran transport is in dock.14   INT. KIRA'S QUARTERS - CLOSE ON BAREIL	Looking out the window.  He's dressed only in a pair of  	loose-fitting Bajoran sweatpants.	Suddenly two slender arms encircle his bare chest from behind.  	Bareil smiles slightly.					BAREIL			I thought you'd sleep until noon.15   NEW ANGLE	Include Kira, dressed in a nightshirt, and reveal that we're 	in Kira's Quarters.  Kira tightens her embrace on Bareil 	and rests her cheek against his back.					KIRA			Shh.  You're supposed to be relaxing.	She runs her hand along his chest.					BAREIL			Oh, I'm... very relaxed.					KIRA			Good.	Bareil opens his eyes and turns around so that he can return 	Kira's embrace.  The two of them kiss.					BAREIL			And how are you feeling this morning?					KIRA				(smiling)			Miserable.  I wish you could stay 			here longer.					BAREIL				(playful)			All right, I will.  I'll stay a few 			more days.         DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - 03/21/94 - ACT ONE         5.15   CONTINUED:					KIRA			You know you can't do that.					BAREIL			Why not?					KIRA				(with affection)			Because in two days, you're going to 			be elected Kai.					BAREIL				(joking)			Oh, that.  You know there's no 			guarantee that I'm going to win.					KIRA			Of course you're going to win.  The 			people need you.					BAREIL			Are you going to vote for me?					KIRA			Is that why you spent the past three 			days here?  To get my vote?					BAREIL			Well, I know you don't agree with 			many of my views.  So I thought a 			personal appearance might sway your 			opinion.					KIRA				(sheepish)			I was going to vote for Vedek 			Tolena...	He gives her a lingering kiss.					KIRA				(continues)			But I suppose I might be persuaded 			to change my mind.					BAREIL			Good.				(from the heart)			Because your vote is the only one 			that matters to me.      DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/22/94 - ACT ONE       6.15   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			I may not always agree with your 			interpretations of the prophecies, 			but I think you'll make a wonderful 			Kai.  Besides, everyone knows you 			were Kai Opaka's personal choice to 			succeed her.					BAREIL				(grows serious)			I could never replace Opaka.  Bajor 			wouldn't have survived the occupation 			without her.	A beat as they hold each other close.					KIRA			Once you become Kai, we'll never 			have these times together.					BAREIL			Listen to me, Nerys... No matter how 			busy I become... I'll always have 			time for you.					KIRA			It won't be easy...					BAREIL			I didn't say it would be.  But I'm 			not going to lose you, Nerys.  I 			promise you that.	They kiss again, but gentler, with more love than passion.      DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/25/94 - ACT ONE       7.15   CONTINUED:	(3)					KIRA			I have to report for duty in less 			than an hour.					BAREIL			My ship leaves even sooner.					KIRA			That doesn't leave us much time.					BAREIL			The Prophets say that time is an 			illusion.  That a minute can last an 			eternity if you let it.					KIRA			Do you really believe that?					BAREIL			I'm willing to give it a try.	They kiss once more, with rising passion.  Hold on them in 	each others arms for a beat, then cut to...16   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Close on the station so the docking ring is off camera.  	(Note: If the docking ring is visible there must be two 	Bajoran transports in port.)      DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/25/94 - ACT ONE       8.17thru   OMITTED1819   INT. PROMENADE - OUTSIDE BAJORAN SHRINE	To find VEDEK WINN surrounded by several Bajoran children.					WINN				(to the children; 				benevolently)			I can't tell you how much it pleases 			me to see such beautiful, happy 			children... Remember now, honor the 			Prophets and they will always love 			you.	The children EXIT and the crowd disperses.20   NEW ANGLE	To reveal Kira and Bareil approaching Winn.					BAREIL			As I understand the Sacred Texts, 			the Prophets' love is unconditional.  			They ask nothing in return.	Winn turns and notices Bareil.  She doesn't seem to be at 	all surprised to see him.  On his part, Bareil wasn't looking 	for this meeting, and wants to avoid a public debate.					WINN			Thank you, Vedek Bareil, for reminding 			us how the Sacred Texts can be easily 			misinterpreted.					BAREIL				(smiling)			Nothing pleases me more than providing 			you with an opposing viewpoint, Vedek 			Winn.      DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/21/94 - ACT ONE       9.20   CONTINUED:					WINN				(pleasant)			Somehow you never fail to do that.				(a beat)			I had no idea you were on the station.				(looking at Kira)			But I suppose I shouldn't be too 			surprised.					BAREIL			I would never even try to surprise 			you, Winn.  I understand you've been 			keeping a very close eye on my 			activities these last few weeks.					WINN			The eyes of all of Bajor have been 			focused on you, Bareil.  Why should 			I be any different?  After all, the 			common wisdom is that you're destined 			to be the next Kai.					KIRA			Was that a concession speech?					WINN			Hardly.  The choosing is still two 			days away.  The Prophets may yet 			surprise us all.				(to Bareil, with a 				curt look to Kira)			Remember that, Bareil.  I would hate 			for you to start celebrating 			prematurely.					BAREIL			I'd never dream of it.  Not with 			such distinguished opponents as 			yourself and Vedek Tolena still under 			consideration.					WINN			All I ask is that the people follow 			the will of the Prophets.					BAREIL			I'm sure they will.      DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/21/94 - ACT ONE      10.20   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			What brings you to the station, Vedek 			Winn?	Winn doesn't bother to maintain her veneer of pleasantness 	with Kira.					WINN			My child, if I thought the Prophets 			wanted you to know the purpose of my 			visit, I would've informed you of it 			in advance.					KIRA				(not giving an inch)			Now that I know that you're here, 			I'll be sure to inform Constable Odo 			to increase station security.					WINN			That won't be necessary.  I feel 			quite safe here.					KIRA			It wasn't your safety that concerned 			me.					WINN			Just what are you trying to infer, 			child?					BAREIL				(to Winn)			I'm sure Major Kira meant no 			disrespect.					KIRA				(with an edge)			Oh, no.  None at all.				(pointedly, to Winn)			I just want to make sure we avoid 			the violence that occurred during 			your last visit.					WINN			My child, I know you still hold me 			responsible for the deplorable attempt 			on Vedek Bareil's life.  I can only 			pray that someday you will be cured 			of that unfortunate misconception.         DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - 03/21/94 - ACT ONE        11.20   CONTINUED:	(3)					KIRA			You can be sure that's one prayer 			that'll never be answered.					WINN			What a pity... for both of us.	Kira's about to let loose with another cutting remark, but 	Bareil places a restraining hand gently on her shoulder.					BAREIL				(trying to extricate 				himself)			Well, I'm afraid I have a transport 			to catch.					WINN			Of course you do.  I'm glad we've 			had this chance to talk.					BAREIL				(traditional farewell)			May the Prophets guide your path.	As Bareil leads Kira away, she can't help but get in one 	last parting shot.					KIRA			And watch your every step.	Bareil and Kira EXIT off camera.21   NEW ANGLE - FIRST FLOOR AIRLOCK	Down the Promenade and in the opposite direction from where 	Kira and Bareil went, arriving passengers step onto the 	Promenade.	They are followed by a lone passenger, an older Bajoran man, 	who walks unassumingly with his head tilted down.  A satchel-	like bag is slung over his shoulder.  The man, KUBUS, pauses 	to take in the Promenade.  He has a gaunt, weary face.  	Seemingly wary of being recognized, he tilts his head down 	again, tries to blend in with the crowd...22   NEW ANGLE - MOVING WITH KUBUS	He walks along in the flow of foot traffic... no one notices 	him... until he bumps into a Bajoran man, EBLAN.      DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/25/94 - ACT ONE      12.22   CONTINUED:					EBLAN				(politely)			Excuse me...	Kubus doesn't look up, simply walks on.  Eblan continues on 	for a few steps... then turns around.  He looks after Kubus, 	troubled by the sight of him...	Curious and concerned, Eblan starts to follow Kubus...23   NEW ANGLE - KUBUS AND EBLAN	In the f.g., Kubus walks toward us, head tilted down.  Eblan 	moves up alongside of him and grabs Kubus by the arm, turning 	him around...					EBLAN			Wait... I know you...					KUBUS			You must be mistaken.	Kubus abruptly turns from Eblan and walks on.  But Eblan is 	not easily dissuaded.					EBLAN				(dogging Kubus)			No.  I've seen you before.  You... 			You're...				(figures it out)			Kubus.  Kubus Oak.  You worked for 			the Cardassians.24   NEW ANGLE	As people are stopping and looking at Kubus.  Some don't 	want to get involved... some aren't sure Eblan's right, but 	others begin to block Kubus's path.      DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/25/94 - ACT ONE      13.25   ANGLE ON KUBUS	As he tries to push through the gathering crowd.					KUBUS				(trying to be forceful)			Move.  Get out of my way.	Surprisingly the crowd, unsure what to do, starts to part 	for him.					EBLAN				(to the crowd)			What are you doing?  Don't let him 			get away.  He's a traitor.  Stop 			him.	Just as Kubus begins to see daylight, Eblan grabs him by the 	shoulder and flings the frail old man up against a nearby 	wall.					EBLAN			You're not going anywhere.					ODO (O.S.)				(overriding all)			What's going on here...26   REVEAL ODO	shouldering into the circle of people around Kubus, eyeing 	each Bajoran in turn.					EBLAN			See for yourself.	Eblan steps aside so that Odo can get a clear view of Kubus.					ODO				(recognizing him)			Secretary Kubus.  Last I heard, you 			were living on Cardassia.					KUBUS				(tired)			I decided it was time to come home.         DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - 03/21/94 - ACT ONE        14.26   CONTINUED:					ODO			Welcome back.				(matter-of-factly)			You're under arrest.	Kubus eyes Odo unhappily.  Odo puts a hand on his shoulder, 	and begins escorting the unprotesting Kubus to the Security 	Office.27   NEW ANGLE	To reveal Vedek Winn... who has observed the entire 	confrontation.  She watches Kubus with contempt.28   CLOSE ON KUBUS	Who takes note of Winn as Odo leads him away.  And as the 	crowd swallows Kubus up...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                DEEP SPACE: "The Collaborator" - REV. 03/21/94 - ACT TWO      15.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:29   INT.

All 			blessings on the new Kai.					CROWD				(walla)			Kai Bareil... Blessings on the Kai... 			May the Prophets guide you... Follow 			your pagh...	Suddenly the crowd is silenced as they stare past Bareil at 	the top of the staircase.30   CLOSE ON BAREIL (OPTICAL)	Bareil turns around.  A bright light shines on his face.  He 	winces and shields his eyes, squinting to make out what has 	drawn the crowd's attention.31   NEW ANGLE - BAREIL'S P.O.V.

It's KAI OPAKA.32   CLOSE ON BAREIL (OPTICAL)	As he recognizes her.					BAREIL			Kai Opaka?33   CLOSE ON OPAKA (OPTICAL)	As she comes down the steps and stands beside Bareil.					OPAKA			Be at peace, my child.

Follow me.	Bareil and Opaka walk down the stairs together.34   FOLLOW BAREIL AND OPAKA (OPTICAL)	As they walk together, Winn and the other Vedeks bow and 	step away from them.					WINN			Be careful, Bareil.  The path she 			walks is a narrow one.
