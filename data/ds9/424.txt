SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Energy discharges crackle off the station as DS-9 is buffeted 	by a plasma wave front.					SISKO (V.O.)			Station log, Stardate 47182.1.  DS-			Nine has been temporarily evacuated 			due to a violent plasma disruption 			in the Denorios Belt.  Until the 			disturbance ends, we'll be forced to 			maintain the station with a skeleton 			crew.2    INT. OPS	KIRA and DAX are at their stations.  Otherwise, Ops is 	deserted.  SISKO ENTERS from his office.					SISKO			How are we holding up?					KIRA			So far, so good.  I'll say one thing 			for the Cardassians, they built this 			place to last.					DAX				(playful)			And just in case it doesn't, I've 			got the Orinoco prepped and ready at 			Pad "C."					SISKO			Any word from Chief O'Brien?					DAX			He and Odo checked in about an hour 			ago.  They sealed off the airlocks 			in the upper and lower pylons and 			were moving on to the docking ring.					SISKO				(into com)			Sisko to O'Brien.        DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - 07/29/93 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE			O'Brien here.					SISKO			What's your status, Chief?3    INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR	O'BRIEN is working on a panel... ODO's a little further down 	the corridor, looking around.  (Intercut as needed with 	previous scene.)					O'BRIEN				(into com)			Almost done, Commander.  We've sealed 			all the airlocks on Levels Twenty-			One, Twenty-Two and Twenty-Three, 			but we still have to check the outer 			bulkheads to make sure there hasn't 			been any crystallization from the 			plasma discharges... Shouldn't take 			much longer.					SISKO'S COM VOICE			I thought you might like to know... 			we received a message from Bajor 			just before the plasma storm cut off 			communications.  The shuttle with 			your family aboard arrived safely.	O'Brien wasn't expecting any trouble, but he's relieved 	anyway.					O'BRIEN			Yes, sir.  Thank you.  O'Brien 			out.	While O'Brien has been talking to Sisko, Odo's been looking 	around at the far end of the corridor, near an airlock.					ODO			Did you hear that?					O'BRIEN			Hear what?	Odo moves over to an airlock door.        DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - 07/29/93 - TEASER        3.3    CONTINUED:					ODO			I could've sworn I heard something.	Odo hits the door control and the airlock opens revealing...					O'BRIEN				(reacts)			Quark.4    ANGLE ON QUARK	Who stands up from where he's apparently been sitting inside 	the airlock.					ODO				(accusatory)			What are you doing here?  You're 			under strict orders from Sisko not 			to leave the bar.					QUARK			I'm not a prisoner, Odo.  I 			volunteered to stay and help you 			protect the station.					ODO			The only reason you "volunteered" 			was because there wasn't any room on 			the evacuation shuttles for six 			hundred bars of gold-pressed latinum.				(beat)			Which still doesn't explain what 			you're doing out here in the docking 			ring.					QUARK				(with dignity)			I was saying good-bye to my brother.					ODO			Your brother?  His shuttle left three 			hours ago.					QUARK				(crushed)			Funny, it's only been three hours... 			and I'm already lost without him...        DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - 07/29/93 - TEASER        4.4    CONTINUED:					ODO			Oh, please.  Don't try to tell me 			you've been sitting here all this 			time pining for Rom.					QUARK			I know, I know.  He couldn't find a 			cup of water if you dropped him in a 			lake... but even if he is an idiot, 			he's still my brother...					ODO			And you'd betray him in a second if 			it suited your interests.					QUARK			But that doesn't mean I don't love 			him...				(to O'Brien)			Chief, do you have any brothers?					O'BRIEN				(not sure what Quark 				is getting at)			As a matter of fact, I have two...					QUARK			And did you ever have to say 			good-bye to them?					O'BRIEN			Sure, when I joined Starfleet...					QUARK			And did it bring a tear to your eye?					O'BRIEN				(thinking back)			I suppose it did.					QUARK				(triumphant, gestures 				to Odo)			Well try explaining that to him.	Quark walks off with wounded pride.  O'Brien and Odo exchange 	a look, then follow him down the corridor.  We stay behind, 	then move into...        DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - 07/29/93 - TEASER        5.5    INT.

SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	The storm rages on.7    INT. OPS	Sisko, Kira, and Dax are at their stations.					DAX				(off sensors)			The storm's intensity is up thirty-			seven percent.					KIRA			Is there any way to tell how long 			it'll last?					DAX			Your guess is as good as mine.  Plasma 			storms are extremely rare.				(off Kira's frown)			But look on the bright side, this 			gives us a great opportunity to study 			one.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     7.7    CONTINUED:					KIRA				(mild sarcasm)			Lucky us.8    NEW ANGLE	As BASHIR ENTERS from the Turbolift.					BASHIR			You should see the view from the 			Promenade.  Simply amazing.					SISKO			I assume the Promenade is secure.					BASHIR			Yes sir.  I've struck the sails and 			battened the hatches... so to speak.	Dax's attention is brought back to her panel by a flashing 	alarm light.  She studies it carefully.					DAX			Benjamin...				(off reaction)			You'd better look at this.	Sisko joins Dax and checks her panel.					DAX			I'm detecting a small vessel headed 			this way at one quarter impulse.					KIRA			They're hailing us.					SISKO			On screen.	Kira operates her panel.					KIRA			I can't get a visual.	She patches the signal through audio only.  The signal is 	distorted, with frequent dropouts.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     8.	(Underlined words can be heard clearly, the rest is 	garbled.)					VERAD (V.O.)				(through static)			... cargo ship Ekina.  We've been 			caught by the storm.  Our engines 			have been severely damaged.  We need 			emergency assistance.  Can you read 			me?  Repeat, this is the cargo ship 			Ekina...	The static grows worse until it totally drowns Verad out.9    OMITTED10   BACK TO SCENE	Kira tries in vain to regain the signal.					KIRA			I've lost it.					SISKO			Can you get a transporter lock on 			the crew?	Kira tries, but it's no use.					KIRA			There's too much interference.					SISKO			Engage the tractor beam.  Bring them 			into the closest docking bay.					KIRA				(operates controls)			It's not working.  The plasma storm 			is dispersing the beam.					DAX			Maybe if we modulate the frequency 			of the beam...	Dax takes over the operation at her own panel.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     9.10   CONTINUED:					DAX				(worried)			I've got them.  But I don't know how 			long I can hold on.					SISKO			Bring them into docking bay five.					BASHIR			There might be casualties.  I'll get 			down to the Infirmary.					SISKO				(nods to Bashir; to 				com)			Sisko to O'Brien.11   INT. PROMENADE	(Intercut as needed)  The Promenade is empty.  O'Brien is in 	foreground; Odo is in the background, talking to Quark.					O'BRIEN			O'Brien here.					SISKO'S COM VOICE			We've got some storm victims coming 			into docking bay five.  They may be 			in need of assistance.					O'BRIEN			I'll have to release the emergency 			seals on the airlock before they can 			board the station.				(beat)			On my way.12   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	A tractor beam holds a beat-up alien cargo ship.13   INT. DOCKING BAY AIRLOCK	Odo and O'Brien ENTER.  The hatchway of an alien ship fills 	the far side of the airlock.  O'Brien checks the ship's hull 	and locates an emergency hatch release.					O'BRIEN			Stand clear.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 07/30/93 - ACT ONE    10.13   CONTINUED:	Odo moves back a little and O'Brien opens the door.  Smoke 	pours out of the hatchway and a woman staggers into the 	airlock.	The woman, MAREEL, is a tall humanoid alien, attractive yet 	capable-looking.  She coughs spasmodically from the smoke.					O'BRIEN				(concerned)			Are you all right?  Is anyone hurt?	While O'Brien is distracted by Mareel, a grizzled Klingon 	mercenary, T'KAR, emerges from the smoking hatchway and aims 	a disruptor at O'Brien's head.					T'KAR			Not yet.	Mareel stops coughing and points a phaser at Odo.					O'BRIEN			What the hell do you think you're 			doing?					T'KAR				(gestures toward the 				airlock door)			No questions.  Into the corridor.	T'Kar shoves O'Brien through the airlock.14   INT. DOCKING BAY	O'Brien and Odo ENTER the docking bay, followed by Mareel, 	T'Kar and two other gunmen.  One of the gunmen, YETO, is 	also Klingon, younger and less battle-scarred looking than 	the first.  His eagerness and excitability make for a sharp 	contrast to T'Kar's professionalism.	The other, VERAD (seen earlier on viewscreen), is slight and 	nervous looking.  Leopard-like spots on the side of his head 	identify him as a Trill.  Like Mareel, he is equipped with 	Federation equipment.  He carries a strange high-tech box 	under one arm.					O'BRIEN			This is a fine way of showing your 			gratitude.  We just saved your lives 			out there.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE    11.14   CONTINUED:					T'KAR				(to Yeto)			You see?  The ever-helpful Federation.  			So predictable.					O'BRIEN			Listen here, friend... in case you 			haven't heard, the Federation and 			the Klingon Empire are allies now.					T'KAR				(spits)			The Empire is governed by doddering 			fools and frightened old women who 			aren't worthy of the name Klingon.				(to the woman)			Mareel, the combadges.	Mareel takes Odo and O'Brien's combadges and tosses them to 	T'Kar.  T'Kar puts on O'Brien's badge and hands Odo's to 	Verad.  Mareel gives Odo the once over.					MAREEL				(re: Odo)			This one must be the shape-shifter.	Yeto gives Verad a little shove.					YETO				(impatient)			Go on, what are you waiting for?	Verad, who has been hanging back, comes forward and places 	the high tech box at Odo's feet.					O'BRIEN				(to Verad, surprised)			You're a Trill.	Verad avoids O'Brien's gaze and, shielding his work with his 	hand, types a code into a panel on the side of the box.  The 	box unfolds like a flower.					T'KAR				(re: the box)			Inside.					ODO				(outraged)			And what if I refuse?     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE    12.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					VERAD				(jumpy)			Please.  Do as he says and no one 			will get hurt.	Odo studies Verad carefully.  He is middle-aged, a little 	out of shape... nervous... and very, very scared.  Verad 	averts his eyes.  Whenever Verad talks, he avoids making eye 	contact.					T'KAR			Now, shifter.				(re: O'Brien)			Or this one dies.15   ON ODO (OPTICAL)	Odo gives T'Kar an icy stare, clearly not intimidated, then 	MORPHS into liquid and pours himself inside the box.16   BACK TO SCENE	Verad retreats fearfully from the liquid-filled box.  Seeing 	that Verad will no longer approach it, Yeto snorts in disgust 	and taps the panel.  The box seals itself shut.	T'Kar prods O'Brien with the muzzle of his disruptor.					T'KAR			Let's go...				(sarcastically)			Ally.17   INT. SURGERY	Bashir's readying the Surgery Area for business when O'Brien 	steps into his peripheral vision.					BASHIR			Were there any casualties?	Bashir turns and sees the four intruders.  T'Kar has O'Brien 	at gunpoint.					T'KAR			That depends on you.	Yeto gestures with his disruptor for Bashir to raise his 	hands, while Mareel tears Bashir's combadge off his uniform 	and tosses it to Yeto, who puts it on.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/03/93 - ACT ONE    13.17   CONTINUED:					T'KAR			Yeto, get the Ferengi.	Yeto leaves.					BASHIR				(with an edge)			You mind telling me what this is all 			about?	T'Kar shoves his disruptor into Bashir's face.					T'KAR			Any more questions?					VERAD				(alarmed)			Don't hurt him.	T'Kar glares at the Trill with disgust.					T'KAR			Mareel, the box.	Mareel comes forward with the box.					T'KAR				(to Bashir)			Put it in your stasis chamber.	Bashir hesitates.  T'Kar aims his disruptor at the box.					T'KAR			Now.  Or I will destroy it.					BASHIR				(doesn't get it)			Is that supposed to be some kind of 			threat?					O'BRIEN			They've got Odo in there.					BASHIR				(registers surprise)			I see... In that case...	Bashir opens a small stasis chamber used for storing samples.  	He places the box containing Odo inside and seals the chamber.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/03/93 - ACT ONE    14.18   INT. OPS	Sisko, Dax and Kira are gathered around Dax's station.  They 	look worried.					DAX			I'm still not getting a response 			from O'Brien or Odo.					SISKO			Run a level three security scan.					T'KAR (O.S.)			Don't bother.	Sisko and the other look up to find T'Kar, Verad and Mareel 	at one of the entrances to Ops.  Their weapons are out and 	they're using Bashir and O'Brien as human shields.					VERAD				(extremely nervous)			Please... take your hands away from 			the controls.	Sisko, Dax, and Kira react in surprise, but keep their hands 	where they are.19   CLOSE ON T'KAR (OPTICAL)	As he fires his disruptor into the air.					T'KAR			Now.				(gestures with his 				disruptor)			To the center of the room.	Kira and Dax look to Sisko.  Sisko weighs the situation, 	then...					SISKO				(reluctantly)			Do as he says.20   CLOSE ON VERAD AND MAREEL	As Sisko, Dax and Kira move down to the Ops table, Mareel 	takes Verad's free hand and gives it a loving squeeze.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE    15.20   CONTINUED:					MAREEL			Don't worry, Verad.  Everything's 			going to be all right.	Mareel removes the combadges from Sisko, Dax and Kira and 	equips herself with one.21   BACK TO SCENE	T'Kar gives O'Brien a shove.					T'KAR			Get with the others.	O'Brien gives T'Kar a defiant look, then he and Bashir join 	the others.					T'KAR				(to Verad)			Your turn, little man.	Mareel and Verad immediately move to the consoles and begin 	operating the controls.					VERAD				(to Mareel)			Don't forget to disable the backups 			as well as the primary systems.	Verad and Mareel work the controls as if they've carefully 	rehearsed ever step.22   ANGLE ON SISKO AND THE OTHER CREWMEMBERS	As they watch Verad and Mareel shut down the station's 	controls... O'Brien talks quietly, bringing the others up to 	speed.					O'BRIEN			It's my fault, Commander.  They took 			us by surprise.  Somehow, they must 			have neutralized the security systems 			in the docking ring.					SISKO			And how did they manage that?     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE   15A.22   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			I'm not sure.				(a beat)			But I've got a pretty good idea.  We 			ran across Quark in an airlock a 			little while ago.     DEEP SPACE: "Invasive Procedures" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE    16.22   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			When this is over, Quark and I are 			going to have a little "talk."23   ANGLE ON SISKO	He notices that Dax's eyes are locked on Verad.					SISKO				(off her stare)			Do you know him?	Dax shakes her head.  She looks a little worried.  She 	suspects she knows why Verad is there, but she still doesn't 	want to admit it, even to herself.24   INT. QUARK'S	Quark's placing small vials of liquid into a padded case.  	He picks one up and holds it up to the light.  He's just 	about to put it into his pocket, when he notices...	Yeto looming in the doorway.  Quark's a little nervous.  	It's never easy doing business with Klingons.
