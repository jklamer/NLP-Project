PARIS NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT	We're looking at a LARGE BLUE WINDOW. The SHAPE of a	man's body can be seen through the window -- he's	flying through the air in slow-motion directly toward	us. He finally SMASHES through the glass and lands	heavily on the floor. Another man steps into view in	the frame of the broken window: it's BASHIR, dressed in	a smart-looking period tuxedo. He pauses to brush off	some dirt and debris from his tuxedo, then steps into	the room. MOVE to reveal the scene:	A mid-1960's era Parisian nightclub complete with a	bar, tables, and dance floor. By the overturned	tables, broken glass and bodies lying on the floor, we	realize that a large fight has just ended with Bashir	throwing someone through the window. (We will later	learn that the unfortunate man is named FALCON -- a	large, bald man with an eyepatch and distinctive	clothing.)	Bashir moves to the bar where a gorgeous woman named	CAPRICE has been watching with concern. She's wearing a	dress slit way too high on the side and a neckline that	plunges way too low. Amid the debris there's a silver	ice bucket with a bottle of champagne. Caprice reaches	over and picks up the bottle...2    ON FALCON	Who opens his eye. He pulls a KNIFE out of his	clothes... he glances up at Bashir and Caprice -- their	backs are to him... Falcon begins slowly heading toward	Bashir...3    BASHIR	Bashir takes the bottle, hands Caprice a champagne	glass, gives her a cool, confident look... begins to	unwrap the foil on the champagne -- but then he	suddenly notices something on the bottle.Ouick cuts:        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - TEASER        2.4    CLOSE ON BOTTLE (OPTICAL)	Reflected on the bottle is the image of Falcon	coming up behind them with the knife!5    BASHIR	Calmly taking off the wire mesh on the bottle,	seemingly oblivious to Falcon...6    FALCON	raises the knife...7    BASHIR	calmly points the bottle at Falcon and POPS the CORK.	The cork hits Falcon right between the eyes and he	drops like a rock, unconscious. Bashir eyes him coolly,	then blows away imaginary smoke from the top of the	bottle and looks at the label.					BASHIR			Lot of kick for a forty-five Dom.	He begins pouring them both champagne.					CAPRICE			Thank you, Mister... Mister... ?	Bashir gives her his most debonair look.					BASHIR			BASHIR.  Julian Bashir.	He leans in and she falls into his arms. They kiss...	and just then we HEAR the sound of someone CLAPPING	from O.S. Bashir turns and reacts to...8    GARAK	who is sitting at a table in the far corner of the	room, applauding Bashir. Garak is wearing his own	period tuxedo and seems very amused.					CAPRICE			Who's that?					BASHIR				(annoyed)			An uninvited guest.	Bashir leaves her at the bar and moves over to Garak.	Bashir considers him for a moment.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 TEASER         3.8    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Nice tux.					GARAK			Thank you.					BASHIR			Now get out.					GARAK			But Doctor, I've only just			arrived.					BASHIR			Garak, breaking into a holosuite			during someone's program is not			only rude, it's illegal.

I'm annoyed			that you've intruded on my			privacy.					GARAK			Privacy, Doctor? I'd say it goes			far deeper than that.				(off his look)			Ever since you received this new			program, you've been spending			virtually all of your free time			in the holosuite. But you haven't			told anyone what the program is.					BASHIR			Am I supposed to?					GARAK			No. But you're a -- forgive me --			a talkative man and it's unusual			for you to have secrets.					BASHIR			I must've picked up the habit from			you.				(indicating he should leave)			Now, if you'll excuse me...	Garak stands up, but isn't quite ready to give up.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 TEASER         4.8    CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK			Is this fantasy of yours really			that revealing of your inner			psyche?					BASHIR			What?					GARAK			Is that why you're so protective?			Afraid that I might learn some			humiliating secret about the real			Julian Bashir?					BASHIR			This is just a fantasy, Garak.			I'm not hiding anything.					GARAK			If you have nothing to hide, then			why not let me stay.	Bashir struggles for a quick beat, finally decides that	the easiest thing is just to stop arguing about it.					BASHIR			All right. But I've only got			another two hours before I go on			duty and I want to enjoy myself.			So keep quiet and don't rain on my			parade.					GARAK			Your parade?					BASHIR			Nevermind.					GARAK			Don't worry, Doctor. I can be			quite discreet. You'll barely			know I'm here.					BASHIR			Good.					GARAK			But if I may make one observation.					BASHIR			Garak...					GARAK			I just wanted to point out that			your lovely companion is leaving.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - TEASER        5.8    CONTINUED:	(3)	Bashir turns just in time to see Caprice walking out	the door. He reacts with resignation.					GARAK				(continuing)			Odd. She seemed so interested in			your advances only a moment ago.			I wonder what scared her off?	Bashir gives him a pointed look.					GARAK				(continuing)			Oh, no. I do apologize. You must			be incensed. In fact, if I were			in your shoes, I would... grab a			bottle of champagne and shoot me.					BASHIR			I can see I'm going to regret this			already...					GARAK			Come on, Doctor we're going to			have a wonderful time... after			all, what could possibly go wrong?	As the two of them EXIT the club...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT ONE        6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE:  Episode credits fall over opening scenes)9    INT. BASHIR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT	A luxurious penthouse apartment in Hong Kong, 1964.

She's carrying a long metal 	carrying case and has a key to the apartment. Luvsitt 	ssmiles at Bashir.					LUVSITT			Mister Bashir, I didn't expect you			home so soon.					BASHIR			I decided to leave Paris a little			early. Allow me to introduce my			friend, Mister Garak.

She presses a hidden button	on the artwork and then the artwork SLIDES ASIDE	revealing a small ARSENAL inside. Various weapons of	every description can be seen hanging inside the wall.	Garak is astonished. Bashir moves to the bar.					BASHIR				(to Garak)			Care for a drink?					GARAK			Not just yet.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT ONE        8.9    CONTINUED:	(2)	Luvsitt OPENS the metal case and takes out a LARGE	SNIPER RIFLE, which she hangs up in the arsenal.					GARAK			Is she your valet or your personal			assassin?	Bashir begins mixing himself a drink at the bar.					BASHIR			Valet. And Mona's very capable.			Speaks seven languages, has			degrees in chemistry, physics, and			biology, can fly anything from			jets to helicopters... and she			makes an excellent martini.	Garak takes a seat, makes himself at home.

And you live here?					BASHIR			Yes. I work for one of the nation-			states of this era -- Great			Britain -- which is battling			various other nations in what was			called the Cold War. This			apartment, my clothes, weapons,			even my valet were all provided to			me by the government.        DEEPSPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT ONE        9.9    CONTINUED:	(3)					GARAK			I think I joined the wrong			intelligence service...	Off Bashir's pleased look...	CUT TO:10   EXT.

She's dead. Before Bashir	and the others can react, O'Brien steps into the open	doorway. TWO HENCHMAN flank him, both aiming guns at	Bashir.

The sideboard TURNS AROUND, revealing	a complex CONTROL PANEL, and the entire the wall SLIDES	ASIDE revealing a HUGE MAP OF THE WORLD. And there,	standing in front of the wall, working on her	clipboard, is Dax. She's wearing her lab coat, hair in	a bun, glasses, as seen in the photograph. Garak, Kira	and Bashir all trade glances -- there she is. Dax is	very conservative, scientific.					DAX				(to Sisko)			We're almost ready. I'm making			some last-minute adjustments to a			South American Site.	Sisko moves to Dax, takes her hand.					SISKO			I have every confidence in you, my dear.	Dax looks down, clearly embarrassed and flattered by	Sisko's attention.					KIRA				(sotto to Bashir)			She's working with him...	Dax looks up at that moment and Bashir catches her eye -- 	for a fleeting instant we can see that she has more	than a casual interest in "Mr. Merriweather," then she	looks away. But Bashir saw that look, and throughout	the scene, he takes whatever opportunity presents	itself to make eye contact with her again -- and when	he does, we see that she is trying to hide her	attraction to him.	Sisko turns back to the group in the sitting room.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FOUR     39A.39   CONTINUED:					SISKO			You see, Mister Merriweather, I			intend not only to create a new			future...

What happens next?					BASHIR			Once that much lava is released...			the tectonic plates will begin			to... settle.					SISKO			And the surface of the planet will			shrink... just like letting air			out of a balloon.					KIRA			But if the surface of the Earth			shrinks... the oceans...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FOUR      41.39   CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR			Will cover the Earth.				(beat)			Diabolical.					SISKO			Visionary.

As Garak and Bashir	exchange a worried look...									CUT TO:40   INT. PROMENADE	A large amount of bizarre-looking CABLES now lead from	inside Quark's, down the Promenade and disappear into	a corridor. N.D. Ferengi waiters are unspooling yet	another cable down the darkened Promenade. Eddington	is watching them with some dismay.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FOUR      42.41   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM 	The base of the transporter is open, and Rom is	attaching the strange-looking cables into the	transporter mechanism. The tiny room is filled with	Rom's odd pieces of technology, and the room is rapidly	taking on the appearance of a junkyard. Eddington	ENTERS just as Rom opens another panel on the	transporter and begins shoving in his own homemade	devices.					EDDINGTON			Is all this really necessary?					ROM			It's the best I can do.					EDDINGTON			How long until we're ready to try			retrieving their patterns?					ROM			I'd say another hour.					EDDINGTON				(under his breath)			O'Brien's going to kill me when he			gets back.									CUT TO:       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FOUR      43.42   INT. CAVE	O'Brien is handcuffing Garak and Bashir to a support	beam on a huge LASER that is pointing directly down at	the ground.	The laser itself should have a distinctly 1960's feel	to it -- oversized, large pulsing cylinders, tubes,	spheres, etc. From where Bashir and Garak are being	handcuffed, it's clear that they can't get to the guts	of the laser itself. Sisko is standing near the	control switch.					SISKO			This is one of a seventy-four			lasers that I've deployed. When			I throw this switch, it will begin			a five minute countdown that even			I won't be able to stop. And once			this laser fires... this cave will			be filled with molten lava.					BASHIR			Where's Colonel Komananov?					SISKO			She's a spirited individual.			Young... healthy... we'll be			needing women like her to help			propagate the second human race.	He flips a switch on the laser, and it LIGHTS UP and	HUMS with power. A TIMER begins ticking down: 5:00...	4:59... 4:58...					SISKO			Try to stay cool, Mister Bashir.	Sisko and O'Brien EXIT, leaving Garak and Bashir to	meet their fate...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                                DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      44.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:43   INT. CAVES	As before. Bashir and Garak handcuffed to the laser,	which is pulsing menacingly. The timer has reached	3:45... 3:44...					GARAK			Doctor, I don't know if I've made			this explicit to you or not... but			I really don't want to die chained			to a twentieth century laser.				(beat)			I think it's time to end the			program.					BASHIR			We can't do that. We'd wipe out			the patterns of Sisko and the			others.					GARAK			Well, then may I suggest calling			for Commander Eddington and having			him send someone in here to remove			these handcuffs?					BASHIR			No. You heard what Odo said. We			don't know what'll happen if we			interrupt the holo-imaging array			by calling for the doors. The			entire program might collapse and			kill them all.					GARAK				(voice rising)			The only thing I know for sure,			Doctor, is that when molten lava			comes pouring into this cave, you			and I are going to be very			uncomfortable.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      45.43   CONTINUED:	There's suddenly the SOUND of footsteps somewhere in	the cave. From where Bashir is standing he can see	down the adjoining tunnel, but Garak cannot.					GARAK			Who is it?					BASHIR			Our ticket out of here.	Dax ENTERS, carrying her clipboard. She glances at	Bashir primly, then moves to the laser, glancing at her	clipboard and making some final adjustments to the	machine. Bashir eyes her, tries to get back into	character.					BASHIR				(to Dax)			What a waste.	Dax glances up at him.					BASHIR			That no one can see what a			beautiful woman you are.					GARAK				(sotto)			This is your plan?					BASHIR			Shut up.				(to Dax)			Noah only wants you for your			mind... he can't appreciate the			woman within the scientist.	Dax reacts to the remark, tries to concentrate on what	she's doing.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      46.43   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR			Honey... would you grant me one			last request? Take off those			glasses.	Dax hesitates, thinks about it for a second, then	slowly takes off her horn-rimmed glasses. Garak rolls	his eyes, can't believe this is working.					DAX			Like this?					BASHIR			Yes. And you know, your hair			would look so much better if it			were free.	Dax tentatively reaches a hand to her hair... pulls out	the hairpin... and her hair falls to her shoulders.	She gives Bashir a smoldering look.					GARAK			I must say... this is more than I			ever wanted to know about your			fantasy life, Doctor.	Bashir ignores him, focusing on Dax as she rearranges	her hair.					BASHIR			There... there. That's the last			thing I want to remember before I			die.	Dax is genuinely touched.					DAX			Thank you.	She turns, starts to walk out of the cave. Bashir	watches, tense, waiting. Then Dax pauses... puts her	hand in a lab coat pocket... then makes a sudden	decision. She turns, quickly turns to Bashir and gives	him a passionate kiss on the mouth.					GARAK			I'd give the two of you some			privacy if I could.	Dax breaks the kiss, looks into Bashir's eyes for a	long, lingering moment... then quickly EXITS.					GARAK			Great plan. Now can we call			Eddington?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      47.43   CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR			That won't be necessary. Honey's			given me all we need...	Bashir holds up one of his handcuffed hands and shows	Garak that he's holding a key.					GARAK			Kiss the girl, get the key. They			never taught me that in the			Obsidian order.	Bashir quickly starts to unlock his handcuffs. The	timer on the laser reaches 5... 4... 3... They react,	move faster. Bashir frees his hands from the handcuffs	and unlocks Garak.					BASHIR			Come on!44   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	44.	As the two men race from the room, the laser begins	FIRING straight down into the ground, BORING a HOLE	deep into the earth. The cave starts SHAKING, rocks	falling from the ceiling.									CUT TO:45   INT. CAVE TUNNEL 	Bashir and Garak running around the corner. They throw	themselves up against the wall as an EARTHQUAKE	strikes, jolting the cave, debris falling from the	ceiling... then the earthquake stops.	They're safe for the moment. Garak leans against the	cave wall, breathing heavily and very much out of	patience. Bashir sits down on the ground, touches the	side of his shoe heel...46   CLOSE ON SHOE	A tiny panel POPS OPEN on the side of the heel,	revealing a hidden compartment. Bashir pulls out the	CHAMBER/ACTION for a semi-automatic pistol.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      48.47   RESUME	As they talk, Bashir continues to assemble his weapon.	He pulls. a fountain pen out of his pocket, removes the	cap -- it's the barrel. His suspenders are equipped	with ammo clips. Over the above:					BASHIR			We've got to get back to the			control room.					GARAK				(angry)			What?					BASHIR			If this program ends like the			others, either Komananov or Honey			Bare will be killed by Doctor			Noah. The other one's supposed to			end up with me. But in this case,			we have to make sure they both			survive.	Bashir finishes assembling his handgun -- it's a	strange-looking weapon.					GARAK				(re: gun)			You expect to take on Noah and his			men with that?					BASHIR			Look, it's my fantasy. Just trust			me.					GARAK			No. This has gone far enough.			It's time to cut our losses.					BASHIR			We can't do that... Kira or Dax			might be--					GARAK			Yes, they might be killed, and			that is unfortunate. But there			comes a point when the odds are			against you and the only			reasonable course of action... is			to quit.					BASHIR			Quit? Is that what they taught			you in the Obsidian Order? To			give up when things get tough?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      49.47   CONTINUED:					GARAK			As a matter of fact, they did.			That's why I've stayed alive and			so many of my colleagues are dead.			Because I know when to walk away.			And that time is now, Doctor. You			would know that if you were a real			intelligence agent.					BASHIR			That's what this is all about,			isn't it? The fact that my			fantasy happens to step on what			you consider your private domain.			What's the matter, Garak? Have I			bruised your ego by playacting at			something you take so very			seriously?					GARAK			That's something else you haven't			learned, Doctor. A real			intelligence agent has no ego, no			conscience, no remorse. Only his			sense of professionalism. And			mine is telling me it's time to			go.				(calls out)			Computer...	Bashir points the gun directly at Garak.					BASHIR			Don't.					GARAK			Or what? You'll kill me?					BASHIR			If you call for the exit, you			might kill Sisko and the others.			I can't risk that.	Garak considers him for a moment.					GARAK			I'm afraid I don't believe you'll			pull that trigger.					BASHIR			I wouldn't be too sure about that.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      50.47   CONTINUED:	(2)					GARAK			It's time to face reality, Doctor.			You're a man who dreams about			being a hero... because deep down,			you know that you're not.	He holds Bashir's eyes for a moment. Bashir seems to	hesitate.					GARAK			I'm no hero either, but I know how			to make choices... and I'm			choosing to save myself.				(to com)			Computer, show me the--	BLAM! Bashir FIRES the gun and Garak falls to the	ground. Bashir then rushes over to check on Garak.48   GARAK 	sits up, puts a hand to his neck, which has been grazed	by a bullet and is bleeding. Bashir checks on the	wound.					Bashir			You're fine... just a flesh wound.	Garak looks at him in shock.					GARAK			That was awfully close, Doctor.			What if you'd killed me?					BASHIR			What makes you think I wasn't			trying?	Garak looks at him in surprise... isn't entirely sure	whether to believe him or not.					GARAK			Doctor... I believe there's hope			for you yet.					BASHIR			I'm so relieved. Now, we have to			get to the control room. Are you			coming or not?	Garak gets up.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      51.48   CONTINUED:					GARAK			Who am I to question Julian			Bashir, secret agent?				(beat)			Lead the way.	They move off down the passageway...									CUT TO:49   INT. SITTING ROOM/CONTROL ROOM - DAY	Garak and Bashir kick open the huge double doors.	Bashir has the room covered. Sisko is standing near	the control table, holding Dax's face in his hands as	if held just been admiring her new look (hair down, no	glasses). O'Brien is near them both. Kira is sitting	in a chair, her wrists handcuffed together.					BASHIR			Everyone stay right where you are.			Drop your weapons.	O'Brien pulls his gun out of his shoulder holster,	drops it to the floor. Sisko does the same and Garak	quickly picks up one of the guns. Kira and Dax react	with relief.					DAX AND KIRA				(overlapping)			Julian!	They look at each other. Sisko glares at Dax.					SISKO				(to Dax)			This is your doing. You let them			go.					DAX			I'm sorry, Doctor.	She moves to Bashir. Kira gets up. While Garak keeps	his gun trained on the room, Bashir moves to Kira and	uses the handcuff key to unlock her restraints.					KIRA			You are just in time. He was			about to activate the final			sequence of lasers.				(to Bashir)			Kill him, Julian.					BASHIR			No. Not this time, Ana.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      52.49   CONTINUED:					KIRA			Then I will.	She goes for the last gun on the floor. Bashir knows	what she's about to do and he can't let it happen.					BASHIR			Ana, no!	He rushes to stop her, momentarily blocking Garak's	line of fire.	In that instant, Sisko seizes the opportunity to reach	down and quickly hits a button under the table.	He then puts his hands back up in the air.	Bashir and Kira struggle for the gun... and Bashir	manages to pull it away from her. Garak keeps an eye	on the other two men.					KIRA			What are you doing?					WORF'S VOICE			Making a mistake.50   NEW ANGLE 	Showing that Worf -- who was summoned when Sisko pushed	the button -- is now standing behind Garak, pointing a	gun at his head. Garak drops his gun to the floor, as	does Bashir. Sisko smiles.					SISKO			Thank you, Mister Duchamps.	Eddington's COM VOICE cuts in:					EDDINGTON'S COM VOICE			Eddington to Bashir. We're going			to try rematerializing their			patterns in about two minutes.					BASHIR				(to com)			Understood.					SISKO			What is it you understand, Mister			Bashir?... that you should've			killed me when you had the chance?			I agree. But then again, I			suppose that wouldn't have been			very heroic.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      53.50   CONTINUED:	Sisko picks up his own gun and points it at Bashir.					SISKO			I, on the other hand, have no			pretensions about being a hero.	He's about to shoot Bashir, who immediately begins	trying to stall for time.					BASHIR			Wait!				(beat)			Maybe I'm tired of being a hero.			Maybe I've thought over what you			said and decided that you're			absolutely right.					SISKO			About what?					BASHIR			Everything. The decadence of the			world, the need for order... the			more I think about it, the more I			realize that your way may be the			only way.	Sisko pauses for a moment, frowns.					SISKO			You expect me to believe that?			You're Julian Bashir -- a man			whose entire life has been			dedicated to fighting against --					BASHIR			Yes, but all that's about to end			now isn't it? You're going to			destroy this world and start a new			one. So what's the use of me			continuing to protect a doomed			planet? Does that make any sense to you?	Sisko's puzzlement increases... he's not quite ready	for this line of reasoning.					SISKO			No...					BASHIR			I'm an intelligence agent, Doctor.			And if there's one thing I've			learned, it's that there comes a			point when the odds are against			you and the only reasonable course			of action... is to quit.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Our Man Bashir" - 10/26/95 - ACT FIVE      54.50   CONTINUED:	(2)	Garak gives him a sidelong glance, but Bashir ignores	him, presenting Sisko with a perfectly reasonable	expression.					BASHIR			How do you think I've managed to			stay alive so long when all my			compatriots are dead?
