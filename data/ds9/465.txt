QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL	where BASHIR and GARAK are sitting at a table having lunch.  	We pick them up in mid-conversation as Garak is leisurely 	expounding on some theory of his.  Bashir is wolfing his 	lunch down as if he's in a hurry.					GARAK			-- Doctor, I just don't see the value 			in this man's work.					BASHIR			Garak, Shakespeare is one of the 			giants of human literature.					GARAK			I knew Brutus was going to kill Caesar 			in the first act, but Caesar doesn't 			figure it out until the knife is in 			his back...					BASHIR			That's why it's a tragedy.  Caesar 			couldn't conceive that his best friend 			would plot his murder.	As Garak continues, Bashir continues to eat heartily.					GARAK			Tragedy is not the word I would use, 			farce would be more appropriate.  			Supposedly, this man is the leader 			of an entire empire, a brilliant 			military tactician, yet he can't see 			what's going on under his very nose --	Garak stops himself, no longer able to ignore the fact that 	Bashir is eating so fast.					GARAK			Are you in a hurry, Doctor?           DEEP SPACE: "Improbable...

I have more time on 			my hands than I know what to do with.					BASHIR			You could finish those pants I dropped 			off last week.					GARAK			Tomorrow.	Bashir frowns slightly and keeps eating.           DEEP SPACE: "Improbable...

You never 			take the time to savor your food.  			It seems to be a human characteristic.	Garak looks over and sees that at another table, a HUMAN is 	having lunch with an N.D. ALIEN.					GARAK			Look over there... that Talarian 			isn't even half finished with his 			meal, but his human companion's plate 			is empty.					BASHIR			Maybe he and I should get together 			for dessert and leave you and the 			Talarian to wile away the afternoon.					GARAK			It's a very interesting sociological 			trait, don't you think?  For 			generations now, humankind has had 			more than enough food... yet you all 			eat as if you were afraid someone 			was going to come along and take 			your plate away.	Bashir, who's finished his meal, eyes Garak's nearly untouched 	plate.					BASHIR			Garak, why don't you eat for a while 			and let me talk?					GARAK				(musing)			Fear of starvation amid plenty... it 			points to some dark secret hidden in 			the human soul... a gnawing hunger.  			Someone should do a study.        DEEP SPACE: "Improbable...

You're the one 			with all the free time on your hands.	Garak sees that Bashir is having none of this.  He picks up 	his fork to resume eating his half-full plate.					GARAK			If you want to have dessert, go ahead.  			I won't be offended.					BASHIR			I have to go.  I'm sorry to leave 			while you're still eating.					GARAK				(dismissing his apology)			No, no... I'm done, as well.					BASHIR			But you're only half finished.	Garak tosses his napkin down and stands; they start to leave 	Quark's.					GARAK			If you really must know, I've been 			nibbling on Delavian chocolates all 			morning.3    INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	as they ENTER from the Quark's.  SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.					BASHIR			How did you get your hands on Delavian 			chocolates?					GARAK				(lightly)			I promised my... supplier that I 			wouldn't tell.				(beat)			But since I deprived you of dessert, 			I'd be happy to bring some by the 			Infirmary later this afternoon.					BASHIR			Thanks, I'd like that.        DEEP SPACE: "Improbable...

Before Julian 	can move off, KIRA calls out to him from off-screen.					KIRA (O.S.)			Julian...	Bashir turns and sees her approach.					BASHIR			Major...					KIRA			About those atmospheric specifications 			you requested for the Yalosian 			Ambassador...					BASHIR				(remembering)			Sixty percent nitrogen, ten percent 			benzene, and the rest hydrogen 			fluoride, as I recall...					KIRA			We ran a test in one of the guest 			quarters... the mixture was so 			corrosive it started to dissolve the 			carpet.					BASHIR			Don't look at me, it's what they 			breathe...					KIRA			Then I guess we'll just have to pull 			the carpet out...					BASHIR			Just be sure you don't replace it 			with anything red or orange...					KIRA			Why not?					BASHIR			They can't see that part of the color 			spectrum.					KIRA			Is there anything else I should know 			about Yalosians...        DEEP SPACE: "Improbable...

Medical 			emergency on the Promenade...4    NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER PART OF PROMENADE - FIRST LEVEL	as Bashir and Kira head toward the smoke which is now 	billowing from the blasted area.

FIRES burn within... but the AUTOMATED 	FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM is kicking in to put them out.  	Outside the shop, several FIREFIGHTERS with hand-held 	EXTINGUISHERS are putting out small pieces of flaming shrapnel 	from the shop.	Bashir moves forward... and sees a figure lying on the floor 	some yards outside the blown out doors... it's Garak, and an 	N.D. Nurse is at his side.	Bashir hurries to him... and sees that Garak, though he has 	small cuts on his face from flying glass, isn't seriously 	hurt, just momentarily stunned from the blast.  Bashir helps 	him sit up...					BASHIR			Are you all right... ?	Garak reaches up and gingerly touches his own temple...					GARAK			As well as could be expected...	He glances at his burning shop...					GARAK				(wry)			But I'm afraid your pants won't be 			ready tomorrow, after all...	Off Garak's wan smile we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "Improbable...

The fires are 	no longer burning, and the smoke has cleared away.  O'Brien 	is scanning a blasted open portion of a wall panel that seems 	to be the locus of the explosion.					SISKO			Report.					O'BRIEN				(indicating blast)			The explosion was caused by a rupture 			in the power conduit behind this 			wall.					SISKO			What caused the rupture?					O'BRIEN			Probably an overload in the ODN 			juncture.	Odo gives a small harumph as he continues to scan the rubble.					SISKO			I take it you don't agree.					ODO			Let's just say I find it odd that a 			conduit running behind Garak's shop 			would "happen" to overload.					SISKO			So you think someone ruptured it 			deliberately.					ODO			I wouldn't be surprised.  It stands 			to reason that a man with Garak's 			past would have enemies.	Suddenly O'Brien reacts to something on his scanner...        DEEP SPACE: "Improbable...

I'm detecting traces of 			nitrilin.	This strikes Odo as awfully odd.					ODO			Nitrilin is extremely unstable.					O'BRIEN			And very rare.  It couldn't have 			come from the power conduit.					ODO			It could be the residue from a micro-			explosive device planted on the 			conduit and rigged to cause a 			rupture...					SISKO			Making it look like the explosion 			was an accident.					ODO			Exactly.					SISKO				(hits combadge)			Sisko to Ops.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Go ahead, Commander.					SISKO			Delay the departure of all vessels 			until further notice.  We have reason 			to believe that someone may have 			tried to kill Mister Garak.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Acknowledged.	Sisko turns to Odo...					SISKO			I think it's time we had a little 			talk with Garak...									CUT TO:6    INT.

Bashir is treating Garak's wounds with 	a small medical device.  TWO SECURITY OFFICERS hang back by 	the door.					ODO			A simple tailor who used to be an 			agent of the Obsidian Order.					GARAK				(dismissing this)			The Obsidian Order?  Constable, you 			shouldn't put so much stock in Doctor 			Bashir's flights of fancy.				(beat)			Are you sure the explosion wasn't an 			accident, because I can't think of 			anyone who would wish me harm...	Sisko fixes him with a look...					SISKO			Someone tried to kill you, Garak, 			and whoever it was might try again... 			so if I were you, I'd give the matter 			some serious thought...	Garak sees his point, considers for a moment...					GARAK			Well... let me see... there was that 			Nausicaan whose wedding suit I 			misplaced... and that Yridian I owe 			money to... and, of course, there's 			always Major Kira...					BASHIR			This is serious, Garak.					GARAK			I'm being serious.

It's not something I'm 			proud of.	Sisko has had about enough of Garak's dissembling.					SISKO			Garak, I don't like explosions going 			off on my station.  Innocent people 			could've been hurt.  You could've 			been hurt.  So if you know something 			you're not telling us, I suggest you 			start talking.					GARAK			I've told you everything I can think 			of.	Sisko and Odo exchange a skeptical look.					ODO			All right, then.				(sarcastic)			I'll investigate the...

I suggest you stay as close to 			them as possible.	And with that, Sisko and Odo EXIT.  Bashir looks at Garak 	for a moment, then shakes his head in amazement.					BASHIR			Someone should do a study...					GARAK			A study?					BASHIR			To try and figure out why some people 			can't bring themselves to trust 			anyone, even when it's in their best 			interest.	Bashir has finished treating him so Garak now stands.					GARAK			Why is it that no one ever believes 			me, even when I'm telling the 			truth... ?					BASHIR			Have you ever heard the story of the 			boy who cried wolf?					GARAK			No...					BASHIR			It's a children's story about a young 			shepherd boy who gets lonely while 			tending his flock.  So he cries out 			to the villagers that a wolf is 			attacking the sheep.  The people 			come running, but of course, there's 			no wolf.  He claims that it's run 			away, and the villagers praise him 			for his vigilance.					GARAK				(smiles)			Clever lad... a charming story.        DEEP SPACE: "Improbable...
