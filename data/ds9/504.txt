QUARK'S	It's early morning and the station is just coming to 	life. QUARK, behind the bar, is going through his 	opening rituals as his first customer, MORN, enjoys an 	enormous and odd-looking breakfast. A few DABO GIRLS, 	looking lovely, go through their preparations in the 	background.					QUARK 			You know, Morn -- there's nothing 			quite as invigorating as breakfast 			in a bar. Where else can you get 			raw slug livers first thing in the 			morning?	Morn shakes his head as ROM, with his usual good cheer, 	ENTERS and plops onto a stool at the bar. This is 	Rom's routine as well, and Quark has a bowl of gruel 	prepared for him.					ROM 			What's this?					QUARK 			What do you mean, "what's this?" 			It's puree of beetle.					ROM 			I didn't order it.					QUARK 			Of course you "didn't order it" -- 			you don't need to order it. You 			have it after work every morning.					ROM 			Well, I'm not having it this 			morning. I'd like two eggs, over 			easy with three strips of bacon 			and a side of corned beef hash.	Quark stares at his brother with disbelief.					QUARK 			What kind of breakfast is that?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign... " - REV. 09/12/96 - TEASER     1A.Al   CONTINUED:					ROM 			It's Chief O'Brien's breakfast of 			choice.					QUARK 			That's the problem with working 			alongside Hew-mons, you pick up 			their disgusting habits. Bacon. 			Corned beef hash...				(winces) 			What's next? Orange juice and 			coffee?					ROM				(sounds good) 			That might be nice.	Quark shudders with disgust but begins preparing Rom's 	"Hew-mon" breakfast.					QUARK 			I don't understand it. You gave 			up a perfectly good job with me to 			work on the station's waste 			extraction system.					ROM 			A good waste extraction system is 			important. Imagine where we'd be 			without one.					QUARK 			Of course it's important -- but my 			point is, you're not getting the 			choice assignments. O'Brien's got 			you on the night shift doing all 			the work no one else wants to do.					ROM				(doesn't see the 				problem) 			I like my work.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign... " - REV. 09/12/96 - TEASER     13.Al   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK 			You like standing all night long, 			knee-deep in waste, fixing some 			broken flow regulator? When you 			could be here --	Quark places Rom's breakfast in front of him.					QUARK 			-- staring at half-naked dabo			girls?	Rom looks around the room considering his brother's 	point. After a beat, it's clear Rom has no regrets.					ROM 			I have a good job. I'm proud of 			the work I do.				(building steam) 			And I know that one day, Chief 			O'Brien will recognize my efforts 			and reward me with a position of 			respect and responsibility. And			why?				(with finality) 			Because that's just the way things 			are... in Engineering.	Quark stares at his brother, then moving off:					QUARK				(half to himself) 			I'm sorry I brought it up.	We hold on Rom as he digs into his breakfast.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign... " - REV. 09/12/96 - TEASER     1C.1    INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS	CLOSE ON a bonsai tree, stone dead. O'Brien's fingers 	test the leaves. Lifeless, they crumble to the touch.					O'BRIEN (O.S.) 			They looked fine last night.	PULL BACK TO REVEAL O'BRIEN and BASHIR standing in 	front of a whole collection of ruined bonsai.					BASHIR			They don't look so fine now.					O'BRIEN 			I can't understand it... I've been 			following Keiko's instructions to 			the letter...					BASHIR 			They were dry as a bone when I 			came by for you yesterday. I gave 			them water, but I guess it wasn't 			enough.					O'BRIEN			You watered them?	O'Brien's dismay is sliding into anger.					O'BRIEN 			These are Idran hybrids. Too much 			water rots their roots.					BASHIR 			Oh.	MOLLY ENTERS, evaluates the damage with a critical eye.					MOLLY			Mommy's going to be mad.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign... " - REV. 09/12/96 - TEASER      2.1    CONTINUED:	O'Brien and Bashir exchange a look of doom.					O'BRIEN 			I can't believe it. Keiko's been 			gone for five days and we've 			killed her plants.					BASHIR			She'll understand, won't she? 			After all, they're just plants.					O'BRIEN			They're not "just plants" - 			they're her bonsai trees.	O'Brien picks up one of the plants, tries to prop up a 	sagging branch. It falls off.					O'BRIEN 			She's nurtured them and cared for 			them, carefully sculpted their 			growth for... months... years.					MOLLY 			You're in trouble.	But O'Brien refuses to let the panic take hold. 	O'Brien sets the plant down, fixes his daughter with a 	desperate smile.					O'BRIEN 			Molly, honey, listen... why don't 			we both go to the airlock and 			welcome Mommy back together. Then 			after we've hugged and kissed her, 			you can explain what happened.					MOLLY				(shaking her head) 			Not me.	O'Brien looks to Bashir.					BASHIR 			Don't look at me.					O'BRIEN			You killed her plants.					BASHIR			We killed them.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign... " - REV. 09/12/96 - TEASER      3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR 			But I think you're overreacting 			to the situation. Keiko will 			forgive you. After all, today's 			your birthday, right?					O'BRIEN				(nodding) 			So far, it's one I'd like to 			forget.					BASHIR 			And Keiko's been away on Bajor -- 			she's missed you. Bring her a 			gift -- what's her favorite 			chocolate?					O'BRIEN			Tellurian mint truffles. But I 			still think you should be there 			with me.					BASHIR 			You don't need me. You know how 			to handle your own wife -- I've 			seen you do it a thousand times. 			Just say you're sorry and take 			full responsibility. You'll be 			fine.				(a beat) 			Besides, I'll be in surgery -- 			operating.	O'Brien doesn't believe him for a second.					O'BRIEN 			On who?					BASHIR 			I'll find somebody.	Bashir smiles and EXITS before O'Brien can say another 	word. After a beat, O'Brien turns to Molly, who picks 	up her BAJORAN DOLL and silently EXITS into her room,	the door CLOSES behind her. HOLD ON O'Brien for a 	beat.2    INT. UPPER PYLON (OPTICAL)	KEIKO and O'Brien, standing in front of the viewing 	port, holding an open box of Tellurian mint truffles.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign...

The beautiful starfield glitters 	behind them.					O'BRIEN				(blurts) 			It was Julian. He overwatered 			them. He was trying to be helpful --			but you know how he is, he doesn't 			always know what he's doing.	Outside the port, the wormhole opens.					O'BRIEN 			I'm sorry, sweetheart. We'll get 			new ones.					KEIKO				(waves her hand) 			Forget it, Miles. They're just 			plants.					O'BRIEN				(laugh-gasp) 			Exactly.					KEIKO			It's not as if something happened			to Molly or the baby.					O'BRIEN			Right. Everyone's just fine. No 			problems at all.	Keiko licks the chocolate truffle from her fingers.					KEIKO 			Good. What about Kira - 			is she back?					O'BRIEN			No, she's still with Shaakar 			traveling around Dahkur Province. 			I thought you were going to visit 			them.					KEIKO			I didn't have a chance.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign... " - REV. 09/12/96 - TEASER      4.2    CONTINUED:	(2)				O'BRIEN 			So, how were the Fire Caves?					KEIKO			Fine. And now it's time for me to 			tell you something.	O'Brien's all ears.					KEIKO 			I'm not Keiko.					O'BRIEN				(thinking she's joking) 			Then who are you?	But Keiko is all business; she speaks calmly, in her 	own voice.					KEIKO 			Listen carefully, Miles. I've 			taken possession of your wife's 			body and I will hold it hostage 			until you've done everything I 			tell you to do -- accurately, and 			without question.	O'Brien, still convinced Keiko is toying with him, 	snuggles up to her.					O'BRIEN 			Everything?					KEIKO			If you don't do precisely what I 			ask, I'll kill your wife.	The smile disappears from O'Brien's face. He doesn't 	understand what's going on with his wife, but he's 	suddenly worried. He takes her hand, slides his 	fingers down to her pulse, trying to stay casual.					O'BRIEN 			Maybe there's been an outbreak of 			Rudellian brain fever on Bajor. 			Let's go down and see Julian, so 			he can...     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign...

O'Brien catches her, lowers her to the 	deck. Her body convulses. As O'Brien tries to control 	her thrashing, her eyes suddenly roll back and she's 	still. O'Brien stares at her for a beat, then brings 	his head down onto her chest, listens for her heart.					O'BRIEN 			No!3    O'BRIEN'S HAND	reaches for his combadge. Before he can touch it, 	Keiko's hand snatches his wrist lightning-fast and 	grips it with incredible force.4    KEIKO	rises from the floor, her eyes shining strangely.					KEIKO 			No, Miles. You're not telling 			anyone. If you do, I'll stop her 			heart... forever.	And on O'Brien's frightened and confused expression, 	we:FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign...

O'Brien wrenches free of Keiko's grip and 	stumbles backward, rubbing his wrist and staring at 	her.					O'BRIEN 			If you're really in control of my 			wife's body, let me speak to her.					KEIKO			She can "hear" whatever you want 			to say.	A thin line of blood trickles from Keiko's nose. She 	ignores it.					O'BRIEN 			That's not good enough. I want to 			talk to her -- I want her to talk 			to me. 	Keiko, unruffled, smiles and lifts her finger -- a 	warning not to threaten her.					KEIKO 			You're in no position to make any 			demands, Miles.	The blood from her nose slowly drips down her upper 	lip. She wipes the blood from her lip, fingers it with 	fascination.					KEIKO 			Strange, these corporeal bodies of 			yours. So fragile. Burst a tiny			blood vessel in the brain and 			every memory, every passionate 			emotion...				(smiles) 			Gone forever.	Keiko takes another mint truffle.					KEIKO 			You shouldn't let me eat all of 			these by myself.					O'BRIEN 			I'm not hungry.	Keiko finishes off the truffle. They stare at each 	other a moment. The blood flow stops.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Assign...

All I want 			you to do is reconfigure some of 			the communication and sensor			relays on the station.					O'BRIEN 			What for?	Keiko leads Miles into the turbolift.					KEIKO 			I can't tell you that.	The turbolift doors close.5A   INT.

It 	connects just under Odo's chin, knocking him cold. 	O'Brien catches him as he falls, lowers him to the 	floor.					O'BRIEN 			Sorry, Odo.				(a beat) 			Chief O'Brien to Keiko O'Brien.	O'Brien keeps moving down the Corridor quickly -	there's no time to waste.					KEIKO'S COM VOICE 			This is Keiko.					O'BRIEN 			I'm finished, but we've got to 			move quickly.				(looking at the fallen 				Odo) 			This place is going to be swarming 			with security -- meet me at 			Runabout Pad "C." Now.					KEIKO'S COM VOICE 			How did you know I'd want a 			runabout?					O'BRIEN 			Because I know what you're 			planning to do. But don't worry, 			I don't give a damn about the 			Celestial Temple, or your non-			corporeal feuds. I just want my 			wife back. Now you still need me 			to pilot you to the wormhole so 			let's stop wasting time.

RUNABOUT	49-	O'Brien is at the Conn, Keiko sits tensely at Ops.					O'BRIEN 			That's correct, Commander.

You're cleared 			for departure, but before you go, 			there's one thing I'd like to ask 			you.	O'Brien tenses up a bit.					O'BRIEN 			What's that?					DAX'S COM VOICE 			Did you enjoy your birthday?	O'Brien exhales.					O'BRIEN				(going along)			It was full of surprises.	He works the controls, his face set like a man 	determined to drive his head through a brick wall.
