Look at the hate 			in her eyes.  She'd like to kill me.					ODO			Oh?  And why would that be?					MARRITZA			It's obvious.  I'm a Cardassian.					KIRA			This one's not just any Cardassian.  			He's a war criminal.	She nods to Odo, and that's enough say-so for him.  He 	gestures his Security Guard to take Marritza along toward 	the (o.s.) Security Office.16   CLOSE - KIRA	watching them go.  With malevolence.17   INT. SECURITY OFFICE	Sisko stands facing Kira, with Odo seated.  Sisko's concerned, 	but not impatient; and not challenging to her in any way.  	He's sensitive here to the reality that Bajoran/Cardassian 	wounds remain unhealed.            DEEP SPACE: "Duet" - REV. 03/29/93 - ACT ONE             7.17   CONTINUED:					SISKO				(to Kira)			You're saying that this man...				(aside)			What's his name?					ODO			Marritza.

Marritza's 			traveling on a Federation ship.  He 			comes here for a medical emergency, 			and we throw him into a security 			cell.  I, for one, hope he's listed.					KIRA			Commander, I know what I've done 			isn't exactly policy.  It may not 			even be legal.  But it's right.					SISKO			Okay, Major; what do we charge him 			with?					KIRA			I'm charging him with having 			contracted Kalla-Nohra.					SISKO			Do you want to explain that to me?					KIRA			The only way he could have contracted 			that condition was to have served at 			the Gallitep labor camp at the time 			of the mining accident.            DEEP SPACE: "Duet" - REV. 03/29/93 - ACT ONE             8.17   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			And that makes him a war criminal.  			Just being there?					KIRA			Commander, if you had been there 			twelve years ago when we liberated 			the camp... If you had seen the things 			I saw... All those Bajoran bodies... 			starved, brutalized.  D'you know 			what Cardassian policy was?  I don't 			mean just the murder.  Murder was 			only the end of the fun for them.  			First came the humiliation... the 			rape of mothers in front of their 			children...

The Federation to the 			rescue.  You are going to let me out 			of here...					SISKO			I hope so.  Tell me.  How did you 			contract Kalla-Nohra syndrome?					MARRITZA				(slight chuckle)			I don't have Kalla-Nohra.  I have 			Pottrik Syndrome.					SISKO			The freighter captain told us it was 			Kalla-Nohra.					MARRITZA			Ah.  The two conditions are very 			similar; same medication, as a matter 			of fact.					SISKO			Then you didn't serve at the Gallitep 			labor camp?					MARRITZA				(very amused)			Labor camp.  I've never even been to 			Bajor.  I served as a military file 			clerk.               DEEP SPACE: "Duet" - 03/26/93 - ACT ONE              10.18   CONTINUED:					MARRITZA			I now reside on Kora Two, where I 			boarded the freighter which, 			unfortunately for me, came here.  			Now, Commander, if you have no further 			questions, I'd like to be on my way.	Kainon wakes up -- becomes very awake when he sees Marritza.					KAINON			Am I still drunk, or am I in jail 			with a Cardassian?				(yells o.s.)			Odo!  You're not keeping me in here 			with...				(re; Marritza; disgust)			... one of those!  Odo!	Marritza looks over at Kainon -- then back at Sisko.  He 	looks very put-upon.					MARRITZA			I put myself in your hands, Commander.19   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE	Sisko's in his chair; Bashir stands facing him.					SISKO			Let me get this straight.  You're 			saying that Marritza does have Kalla-			Norha?					BASHIR			There's no doubt about it.  He has 			all the symptoms.  And when I ran a 			lower pulmonary bio-probe, it read 			positive.					SISKO			And you're sure he doesn't have 			Pottrik Syndrome.					BASHIR			Absolutely.  If he had Pottrik's, 			the bio-probe would've been negative.               DEEP SPACE: "Duet" - 03/26/93 - ACT ONE              11.19   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Then he was at the Gallitep labor 			camp.					BASHIR			Definitely.  I've cross-checked all 			Bajoran and Federation medical 			records, and there's simply no other 			way he could've gotten that condition.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Kira to Sisko.					SISKO				(taps combadge)			Yes, Major.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Commander, there's an incoming 			transmission for you from Bajor.  			It's the Minister of State.					SISKO			Thank you.				(to Bashir)			If you'll excuse me, Doctor.	Bashir nods -- EXITS.20   INCLUDING SISKO'S MONITOR SCREEN (OPTICAL)	as the face of Minister KAVAL appears.					SISKO			Minister Kaval.

HOLDING CELL AREA (CONTINUOUS)	as Kira ENTERS.  Marritza's still in cell #1 -- finishing a 	meal.  Kira's calm and carefully determined to be reasonable 	and rational.  Though Marritza's still not a happy Cardassian, 	he's in no way threatening or imperious now.  Rather, he'll 	prove to have an almost affable willingness to communicate.					MARRITZA			My compliments on your replicators, 			Major; though this sem'hal stew could 			use some yamok sauce.					KIRA			I'm glad you're enjoying it.					MARRITZA			Oh, I doubt that, Major; I doubt 			that very much.					KIRA			I hope it won't disturb your dinner 			if I ask you a few questions.					MARRITZA			And if I refuse?					KIRA			I'll ask them anyway.	Marritza smiles.

Fortunately, I was lucky 			enough to draw duty in the records 			office at Gallitep.

To keep you Bajorans thinking 			of yourselves as victims.  To keep 			you scared... and helpless.					KIRA			It turned out we weren't so helpless.  			We did get rid of you.					MARRITZA				(dismissive)			Leaving was a political decision.				(beat)			Now I've enjoyed reminiscing with 			you, Major; but I really do think 			it's time you let me out of here.					KIRA			I can't do that.            DEEP SPACE: "Duet" - REV. 03/29/93 - ACT TWO            21.24   CONTINUED:	(6)					MARRITZA			No, of course not.
