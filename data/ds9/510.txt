Bashir almost smiles at 	the sight of him -- truth is, Odo's been coming in a 	lot lately with all sorts of minor ailments.					BASHIR			Good morning, Constable. What can			I do for you today?					ODO			It's my back...					BASHIR				(patient)			Let's have a look.	Bashir motions him to the bio-bed.					ODO			It happened this morning when I			got out of bed...	Odo lets out a gasp of pain as he sits on the bed. 	Bashir scans him with a MEDICAL TRICORDER...					BASHIR			Hmm...     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:	Odo takes this as a bad sign.					ODO			I have Alvanian spine mites, 			don't I?					BASHIR			Actually --					ODO			I'm going to be in pain for the 			rest of my life.					BASHIR				(stopping him)			Odo.				(calm down)			You have a pinched nerve.					ODO			Really?					BASHIR			It comes from bad posture.					ODO				(insulted)			Bad posture? Me? Ridiculous. 			You've never seen anyone sit so 			straight.	And indeed, Odo is sitting up straight -- ramrod 	straight.					BASHIR			Exactly. You're carrying yourself 			too rigidly.					ODO			This is how I've always carried 			myself.					BASHIR			You didn't always have a spinal 			column. You're not a changeling 			anymore. Now that you're 			humanoid, you need to learn 			to relax.					ODO			That's what you said last week.					BASHIR			And?     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - TEASER      3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Bashir prepares a HYPO.					ODO				(reluctant)			It helped.

Worf's morning exercise 			class would be just the thing.					QUARK 			Forget that. I've got a holosuite 			program that'll take care of him. 			Three Orion slave girls strap you 			into a --					ODO			Quark.					QUARK 			Go ahead. Suffer.					ODO			What do you want?	Quark changes his tone -- he has a deal in the works.     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - TEASER      4.3    CONTINUED:					QUARK 			A Yridian I've been dealing with 			sold me something that might 			interest you.					ODO			I don't think so.					QUARK 			You don't even know what it is.					ODO			I know I don't want it.					QUARK 			In that case, can you tell me how 			to get in touch with the Founders? 			I know they'll want it.	This gets Odo's attention.					ODO			What are you talking about?	Quark pulls a glass CONTAINER out of his vest and holds 	it up -- it contains about a pint of SHAPE-SHIFTER GOO. 	Unlike the goo we've seen, this has a BLUISH tint to it 	and exhibits neither movement nor evanescent glint.	Odo takes the container from him, studies it intently.					QUARK 			It's a changeling -- or it was, 			anyway. Since it's dead, I'll let 			you have it for five slips of 			latinum.					ODO			It's not dead.					QUARK 				(quick)			In that case, make it ten.					ODO			It's sick.					QUARK 				(quicker)			Eight and we'll call it even.	But Odo isn't paying attention to Quark; he's studying 	the goo with great interest. Quark pulls a PADD from 	his vest, taps in the cost, and takes the distracted 	Odo's hand to input his thumbprint.     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - TEASER      5.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK 			Pleasure doing business with you.	Quark EXITS, happy as can be. Bashir moves to Odo's 	side.					BASHIR			Odo... if that is a changeling, 			we'd better get it into a security 			field.					ODO			That won't be necessary.					BASHIR			If it gets out of that container, 			it could be dangerous.					ODO			It's not going anywhere, Doctor. 			It doesn't know how... it's just 			a baby.	Bashir reacts... off Odo's intent gaze as he studies 	the goo, we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                            DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE 6-6A.                                ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)4    INT. INFIRMARY	SISKO has joined Odo and Bashir. The goo is now 	sitting atop a scanner.					SISKO			A baby changeling?					ODO				(nods)			Centuries ago, my people sent a 			hundred of us out into the galaxy 			so we could learn about other 			races. When I was found, I looked 			very much like this.	This strikes Sisko as odd -- it's so small compared to 	Odo's present size.					SISKO			You were this... small?					ODO				(nods)			Like a humanoid child, it'll grow. 			Its mass will increase as its 			shape-shifting abilities develop.					BASHIR				(off scanner)			From what I can tell, it was 			exposed to a massive dose of 			tetryon radiation. I'm going to 			have to purge the isotopes with an 			electrophoretic diffuser.					SISKO			Get on it.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE      7.	Bashir nods, gestures to a NURSE. As they prepare to 	work on the goo, Odo and Sisko move off to the other room.					SISKO			Are you sure it's no danger to us, 			Constable?					ODO				(nods)			When I was first discovered, I 			didn't know what I was, or have 			any memory of where I came from. 			I didn't even know I had the 			ability to mimic other forms.	Sisko takes this in, but something about it strikes him as odd.					SISKO			Why would the Founders send such 			helpless creatures out into space?					ODO			To find out if the species they 			encountered posed any threat. 			What better way to gauge another 			race than to see how it treats the 			weak and vulnerable?					SISKO			I see your point.	Sisko considers for a beat...				SISKO			How long will it be before the 			changeling's able to take humanoid 			form?					ODO			Several months. Why?					SISKO			There's a lot about your people we 			still don't know. The changeling 			could provide Starfleet with 			invaluable information about the 			Dominion.  DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE 8-11.    4    CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO			That being the case, I'd like to 			be allowed to work with it -- 			teach it how to shape-shift.					SISKO			I can't think of anyone better 			qualified.				(considers)			But you might want a little help.			Maybe you should contact Doctor 			Mora.					ODO			Mora? Why?					SISKO			He managed to find a way to 			communicate with you. He 			obviously knows what he's doing.	Odo doesn't necessarily agree with this assessment.					ODO			Maybe so. But I'd prefer to do 			this alone.	Sisko hears the restrained emotion in Odo's voice, 	decides to back off.					SISKO			It's your call.				(lightly)			But it's always nice to have 			someone around to help change the 			diapers.					ODO				(dry)			I'll keep that in mind...	Sisko EXITS. Odo moves to the doorway that leads to 	the examining area, watches as Bashir and the Nurse 	work on the changeling. We can see on his face how 	much he wants them to succeed.5    EXT.

INFIRMARY	Bashir is showing Odo the goo, which is still on the 	scanner. It now has that yellowish tint we're used to 	seeing in Shape-shifter goo.					BASHIR			The purge was nearly a hundred 			percent effective -- the 			concentration of isotopes is 			almost negligible.	Odo is immensely relieved, looks down at the goo as if 	it were a baby in a crib.					ODO			It certainly looks healthier...	Bashir gets ready to leave.					BASHIR			I'd better go check on Kira. Did 			you hear? She's in labor.					ODO				(distracted)			Mm-mm...	Bashir sees the look on Odo's face, then glances down 	at what looks to him like a blob of yellow goo...					BASHIR				(smiling)			I guess you've got your own baby 			to think about.	Odo catches himself, looks up. As Bashir heads for the 	door --					BASHIR			There's still a small degree of 			instability in its morphogenic 			matrix. I'm hoping it'll level 			out. I set the computer to 			monitor for biomimetic 			fluctuations just in case.					ODO			Thank you, Doctor.					BASHIR			Good luck.And with that Bashir EXITS. Odo turns his attention back to the goo.     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE   12A.7    CONTINUED:					ODO				(gently)			How do you feel -- better?	He looks down at it with an almost serene expression.					ODO			I realize you can't understand a 			word I'm saying, but that doesn't 			matter. I know you're aware of 			me. You see, I was once like you. 			I spent months in a lab being 			poked and prodded by a scientist 			who didn't even realize I was a 			lifeform. I was just a specimen, 			a mystery that needed to be 			unraveled. He never talked to me. 			It didn't occur to him. I didn't 			know what I was, or what I was 			supposed to do. I was lost, 			alone.	Odo watches as the goo undulates slightly. He leans in 	closer, intent.					ODO			But it's not going to be that way 			for you. I'm not going to make 			the same mistakes that were made 			with me.				(beat)			Come on, I want to show you 			something...	Off this moment...OA   INT. BIRTHING ROOM (FORMERLY SC. 10)	These guest quarters have been set up as a traditional 	Bajoran birthing room. The standard furniture has been 	removed and replaced with PILLOWS, wall TAPESTRIES, and 	a small SHRINE with burning INCENSE.	Kira is wearing a cross between a hospital gown and a 	ornate ROBE. She's sitting on a waist-high TABLE with 	an inclined back support. Bashir is completing a scan 	of her...	Y'PORA -- the Bajoran midwife -- stands at the foot of 	the table, wearing traditional ROBES. O'Brien and 	KEIKO stand to either side. Each has a traditional 	Bajoran NOISEMAKER in their hands -- Y'Pora a CABASA 	type device, Keiko a beaded GOURD, and O'Brien, a small 	GONG.     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE   12B.OA CONTINUED:	In solemn, rhythmic succession, they each play their 	device-for a beat so that we hear a series of sh-sh's, 	rattles, and gongs. O'Brien, however, never quite 	manages to hit the gong in the same place twice, so it 	sounds slightly off-kilter each time. He's doing his 	best, despite the distraction posed by the cloud of 	incense that keeps wafting toward him, irritating his 	eyes and lungs.	Kira is practicing some kind of controlled breathing 	exercise keyed to these sounds, and it's up to each of 	them to carry the rhythm consistently so she can enter 	a state of deep relaxation.	Sh-sh, rattle, clink... sh-sh, rattle, clank... sh-sh, 	rattle, clunk -- this last tone is so flat Y'Pora opens 	her eyes and looks at O'Brien.	She starts another cycle: sh-sh, rattle, clink... sh-	sh, rattle, clank... sh-sh, rattle --OB O'BRIEN SNEEZES (FORMERLY SC. 11)	from the incense as he taps his gong, eliciting a 	clatter. Y'Pora and Keiko do their best not to get	thrown off by this, and Kira doesn't seem to notice 	she's lost -- in her breathing. After a beat, O'Brien 	leans in toward Keiko and Bashir and they move off a 	few paces, maintaining the rhythm throughout.					O'BRIEN				(quiet)			Something's wrong... Kira told me 			this would only take about an 			hour.					BASHIR			For Bajoran women, giving birth is 			all about being relaxed...					KEIKO				(glancing at the gong in 				his hand)			He's right, Miles... that's why 			it's important for us to keep the 			rhythm...	O'Brien nods as if to say "yeah, yeah" -- completely 	missing the hint.					O'BRIEN			I don't think she's going to relax 			until Shakaar gets here.      DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE   12C.OB   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN (Cont'd)				(annoyed)			I called almost six hours ago; it 			takes less than half that to make 			the trip from Bajor.					KEIKO			He's the First Minister of Bajor --			he's a busy man...					BASHIR			So am I... I've got three 			surgeries scheduled this 			afternoon. I'll try to pop in 			later.	Bashir EXITS...					KIRA				(far away)			Y'Pora... the baby... he's 			moving...	Keiko and O'Brien exchange a look, finally, something's 	going to happen...					Y'PORA				(softly)			Relax... breathe... it won't be 			long now.	Sh-sh, rattle, clink... Sh-sh, rattle, clank... sh-sh, 	rattle --OC A SWOOSH (FORMERLY SC. 12)	as the door OPENS and SHAKAAR rushes inside, every bit 	the panicked "husband."					SHAKAAR			Sorry I'm late --	Even Y'Pora can't ride out this interruption -- she 	stops the proceedings. O'Brien is annoyed because it 	looks like a few hours' work just went down the drain.	Shakaar doesn't notice, he only has eyes for Kira. She 	smiles as he moves to her side.					SHAKAAR			How are you?	She nods that she's all right.					SHAKAAR			I threw you off, didn't I?     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE   12D.OC   CONTINUED:	O'Brien nods to himself --					KIRA 			It's all right, I'll get back on 			track. I'm glad you're here.	As if to say "lets get started," O'Brien taps his 	gong... Y'Pora picks up the rhythm with a shake of her 	cabasa, and they're off...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE     13.7A   INT. REPLIMAT	where Odo is sitting at one of the tables. 	SUPERNUMERARIES as needed. He's brought the goo here 	so he can "show" it some of his world, but he doesn't 	want people coming up and asking questions, so he's put 	it in a glass MUG and is acting as if it were a 	beverage.					ODO			This is the Replimat. Humanoids 			come here to eat. They -- we, 			rather -- need to ingest 			nutrients.	Odo sees someone notice him, picks up the mug and 	pretends to take a sip. After they turn their 	attention away from him...					ODO			This is my home. It's a space 			station. People of many different 			species live here together. Once 			you've learned to take humanoid 			shape, I'll show you everything. 			You can live here, too, if you 			want. It's a fascinating place.					WORF (O.S.)			Constable --7B   NEW ANGLE	to include Worf, standing nearby.					WORF			Why are you talking to your 			beverage?	Odo frowns, embarrassed.					ODO			It's not a beverage, it's a 			changeling.	Worf reacts -- he's heard about Odo's find, but he 	finds this all a bit strange.					WORF				(sitting down)			Why did you bring it here?     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE   13A.7B   CONTINUED:					ODO			I wanted it to see the station.				(to the goo)			This is a Klingon.	Worf decides to stay out of it.					WORF			I came to talk to you about the 			Ferengi.					ODO				(to the goo)			He means Quark. I suppose you'll 			have to meet him sooner or later.					WORF			I believe he has been tapping into 			the station's computer and 			downloading secured information.					ODO				(to the goo)			That's illegal.	Worf's brow furrows in consternation, he wants Odo's 	undivided attention.					WORF			We need to set up a data reversion 			trace.					ODO				(to the goo)			I'm chief of security, that's my 			job.					WORF			If we can apprehend him, it may be 			possible to revoke his licence and 			force him to close his 			establishment.					ODO				(to the goo)			Quark runs a bar.     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE   13B.7B   CONTINUED:	(2)					WORF			Odo.					ODO			What?	Worf contains his annoyance, stands.					WORF			Thank you for your time.	With a last look at the goo, Worf EXITS.					ODO				(to the goo)			As you can see, Klingons are a bit 			short-tempered.	Off this mcment...7C   INT. SCIENCE LAB	where Odo is pouring the goo into a large, shallow 	Petri DISH. The goo doesn't fill the dish like a 	liquid, but thickens up to form an irregular shape 	inside it.					ODO			There... doesn't that feel better? 			There's nothing like spreading 			yourself out after being cooped up 			in a jar.     DEEP SPACE NINE: - "The Begotten" - REV. 11/12/96 - ACT ONE   13C.7C   CONTINUED:	Odo smiles down at the goo...					ODO			You have no idea of the marvels 			that are in store for you. Do you 			know what you are? You're a 			changeling. A Shape-shifter. 			You can be anything. A Tarkalean 			hawk, soaring through the sky. Or 			a Filian python, burrowing deep 			beneath the ground. It's all 			yours for the taking.	Odo is thoughtful for a beat, watches the goo move 	slightly.					ODO			I was never a very good 			Shape-shifter -- if you could see 			the face I'm stuck with, you'd 			know what I mean -- but I think I 			can be a good teacher.
