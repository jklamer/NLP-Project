QUARK'S	O'BRIEN and BASHIR are having a drink at the bar. 	WORF is two chairs away at the bar, having a drink 	and trying to work on a PADD. But the argument is 	clearly distracting him.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More... " - REV. 10/01/98 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			Come on. Santa Anna didn't care 			about the "rules of war." If 			he'd executed Davy Crockett at 			the Alamo he would've considered 			it a point of pride.					BASHIR			All right. Try this: in 			Eighteen thirty-six Crockett is 			forty-nine -- quite old by the 			standards of the time. His days 			as an Indian fighter are well 			behind him. He's just an ex-			Congressman... all reputation. 			He's not going to be the man who 			fights to his last breath. When 			it's clearly hopeless, when the 			ammunition is gone and Mexican 			soldiers are swarming over the 			Alamo's battlements, Davy 			Crockett would surrender. 			It's logical.					O'BRIEN			I'm not saying it couldn't have 			happened, I'm just saying there's 			no proof.	Worf has finally had enough.					WORF			You are both wrong. 				(beat) 			The only real question is whether 			you believe in the legend of Davy 			Crockett or not. If you do, then 			there should be no doubt in your 			mind that he died the death of a 			hero. If you do not believe in 			the legend, then he was just a 			man... and it doesn't matter how 			he died.	Worf gets up and heads for the door. O'Brien and 	Bashir consider that for a beat.					BASHIR 			Well. I guess that settles that.					O'BRIEN 			I guess so.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More...

Now, I 			suppose you're going to tell me 			"Well, there's no evidence Travis 			didn't draw the line." But, in 			fact, there's a great deal of 			evidence to suggest that the 			story was invented by...									CUT TO:3    INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	A short time later. Worf unhooks his baldric and 	drapes it across the back of a chair. He starts to 	take off his uniform jacket when the door CHIMES.					WORF			Enter.	The doors open and he is surprised to see KOR.					WORF			Kor?					KOR 			Nuq'nuh, Worf. (Hello.) 			It's good to see you, my friend.	Physically, the old Klingon warrior hasn't changed 	much since we saw him in "The Sword of Kahless" but 	some of the bravado is gone and the swagger is 	missing from his step.					WORF				(formal) 			I welcome you to my home.	Kor finally ENTERS.					WORF			May I offer you refreshment?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More... " - REV. 10/01/98 - TEASER       4.3    CONTINUED:					KOR 			I would be honored to share a 			bottle of bloodwine with the Son 			of Mogh.	Worf gets a bottle and pours them both a drink.					KOR 			I heard the news about Jadzia.					WORF 			She died a warrior.					KOR			I expected nothing less.	Worf hands him a glass and they lift their glasses.					KOR 			To absent comrades.	They drink to that. Kor savors the wine.					KOR				(re: bloodwine) 			Twenty-three oh nine. Very good.				(beat) 			The war goes well for you, Worf? 			A long list of victories to your 			credit, I trust?					WORF			I have been... fortunate.					KOR 			The way of the warrior is not a 			humble path. Show some pride in 			your accomplishments! You've 			earned it!					WORF 			I will... try.				(beat) 			And does the war go well for you, 			Kor?	The smile fades from Kor's face... there's a darker, 	sadder quality to the man now than we've ever seen 	before.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More... " - REV. 10/01/98 - TEASER       5.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					KOR 			No, Worf. It does not go well 			for me. It seems my services are 			not required in the present 			conflict.	That catches Worf completely off-guard.					WORF			But... you are Kor -- a Dahar 			Master, the man who held the 			Korma Pass against T'nag -- 			your reputation alone should've 			assured you a command.					KOR				(rueful) 			I also have a reputation for... a 			certain ruthless quality toward 			those who would stand in my way. 			Mind you, it is not entirely 			undeserved -- in truth, I rather 			enjoy being feared by my fellow 			officers.				(beat) 			However, there is a price to be 			paid for such... singledminded 			devotion to one's ambition. I 			made enemies... perhaps more than 			were necessary.	For a moment, Kor seems to be weighed down by 	regrets, but then he shakes it off and faces Worf.					KOR 			I have no influence left in the 			Empire. Even as our entire race 			grapples with the Dominion... 			there is no place for an old man 			with too many enemies and not 			enough friends.				(beat) 			That is why I have come here 			tonight. It is not easy for me 			to beg for help... but I have 			nowhere else to turn.				(difficult) 			Help me fight again, Worf. Help 			me end my life as I lived it -- 			as a warrior!      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More... " - REV. 10/01/98 - TEASER       6.3    CONTINUED:	(3)	Worf is deeply moved by the old man's plea. He 	stands up and goes to him.					WORF			Tomorrow I will go to General 			Martok and find you a command. I 			can give you an officer's 			commission immediately. So as of 			this moment, you are a soldier of 			the Empire once again.	Worf offers his hand and Kor takes it, grateful 	beyond words.									CUT TO:4    EXT.

KLINGON WARDROOM	This room is Martok's headquarters on DS9 and it has 	been customized with Klingon furniture, tapestries, 	food, battle trophies, etc. A large desk commands 	one end of the room while a round conference table 	sits at the other end. MARTOK is working at his 	desk with a short, elderly Klingon aide -- DAROK -- 	when Worf ENTERS. Martok tosses a PADD down on the 	desk.					MARTOK				(irritable) 			How many more reports does the 			High Council require?					DAROK 			As many as last time.				(hands him another 				PADD) 			And Starfleet is still waiting 			for your signature on these 			repair requests.					MARTOK 			There will come a day, Darok, 			when your services as my aide may 			no longer be required.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More... " - REV. 10/01/98 - TEASER       7.5    CONTINUED:					DAROK				(acerbic) 			I look forward to that day with 			great anticipation. Until 			then...	He pointedly shoves the PADDs toward Martok.					MARTOK			Ah, Worf, good to see you.				(biting)			Darok, thank you.	Darok gives him a curt nod and EXITS.					MARTOK				(re: Darok) 			A pity Captain Sisko frowns on 			summary executions. What can I 			do for you?					WORF 			Kor, the Dahar Master, came to 			see me last night. He has been 			unable to find a command and I --	Martok's reaction is so swift and fierce that Worf 	is caught completely off-guard.					MARTOK 			Tell me you're not going to ask 			me to give that man a ship!					WORF				(surprised)			I had hoped that--					MARTOK 			Then your hopes are in vain! 			That man is not welcome in my 			house and I will certainly not 			have him commanding a ship in my 			fleet!	Martok picks up a PADD, leaving Worf standing there 	stunned for a moment. Worf waits a beat, then 	decides that he cannot leave matters like that.					WORF			General... Kor is a friend and I 			have already --      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More...

Now get out 			before I forget that we are 			brothers!	Worf stares at him for a moment... then EXITS...6    INT. CORRIDOR	Worf ENTERS and stops just outside the door. OFF 	the shocked look on his face...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More...

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Martok and SISKO are discussing strategy in front of 	the wall monitor, which is displaying a MAP of the 	front lines. Martok is in a good mood, eager for 	battle -- the confrontation with Worf has been 	pushed to one side.					MARTOK				(pointing to map) 			I plan to attack the Trelka Five 			Starbase, then push deeper into 			Cardassian territory.				(pointing them out) 			I'll hit the Manora Shipyard, the 			Jem'Hadar breeding facility on 			Sheva Two, the supply depots in 			the Borias Cluster...					SISKO				(dubious)			It would take half the Ninth 			Fleet just to destroy Trelka 			Five.					MARTOK 			I don't intend to destroy the 			base, just damage it -- throw 			them off balance and then move on 			to the next target. Imagine the 			chaos we'll cause once we're 			behind their lines.					SISKO			A cavalry raid...				(off his look) 			Ancient Earth soldiers mounted on 			horseback. They had the speed to 			charge behind enemy lines to stir 			up trouble and the mobility to 			keep from being caught.				(beat) 			How many ships will you take?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More... " - REV. 10/01/98 - ACT ONE     10.7    CONTINUED:					MARTOK 			Five birds of prey. The 			battle cruisers are too slow and 			unwieldy for this kind of 			mission.					SISKO			Do you want to take the Defiant?					MARTOK 			Perhaps the Defiant should remain 			here, protecting the station -- 			in case the Jem'Hadar try their 			own "cavalry" raid. But it may 			be prudent for the Defiant and a 			dozen or so other starships to be 			waiting for us when we return.					SISKO			You mean you might be bringing 			company back with you?					MARTOK				(grins) 			I'm sure you'll be ready to 			welcome them?					SISKO			With phasers charged.	They grin at each other and shake hands.									CUT TO:8    INT. OPS	Darok is waiting in Ops with several PADDs when Worf 	ENTERS from the turbolift, looking for Martok.					DAROK 			The general is still with Captain 			Sisko.				(beat) 			If you're going to anger him 			again, can it wait until after 			he's approved these personnel 			transfers?	Worf shoots him a look, but then Martok ENTERS from 	the captain's office.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More...

I'm glad you're here. 			We're about to embark on an epic 			journey into the very heart of 			danger!	Darok clears his throat irritably, but Martok does 	his best to ignore him as he leads Worf toward the 	turbolift.					MARTOK 			Come with me. I want to inspect 			the Ch'Tang; she may be my next 			flagship.	Darok follows them into the lift.					DAROK 			And what good is a flagship 			without a crew to man her?					MARTOK 			You'll be the death of me, Darok! 			All right -- give me the 			transfers!	The lift sinks out of sight.9    EXT.

KLINGON BRIDGE									CUT TO:	Martok is being guided around the Bridge by a tall, 	powerfully built female Klingon commander named 	KOLANA. Martok is signing PADDs one after another 	as Darok hands them to him. Worf is hovering 	nearby, impatient to speak with Martok. Several 	N.D. Klingons are making repairs in the b.g.					KOLANA 			Our disruptor targeting sensors 			need to be replaced as well as 			the guidance system relays.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More...

He should give the 			Ch'Tang first priority.	Darok nods and works a PADD. Martok waves Worf 	over.					MARTOK				(to Worf) 			Quick -- speak to me now before 			Darok buries me in another 			blizzard of paperwork.	Worf looks around, this isn't exactly where he 	wanted to have this conversation, but he has to take 	the opportunity while he has it.					WORF				(quiet) 			I wish to speak with you about 			Kor. I know that you have strong 			feelings about this but--					MARTOK				(to others, a roar) 			CLEAR THE BRIDGE!	The other Klingons are startled, but they quickly 	EXIT, leaving the two men alone.					MARTOK				(tight) 			I did not expect to hear anything 			further on this subject from you.					WORF				(not giving an inch) 			And I did not expect to be 			forbidden to speak with you on 			any subject. Have I become a 			mere shuVak (servant) to be 			ordered about like Darok?					MARTOK 			Of course not!				(beat, then 				reluctant)      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More... " - REV. 10/01/98 - ACT ONE     13.10   CONTINUED:	(2)					MARTOK (Cont'd)			Very well. Talk and be done with			it.					WORF			He came to me, asking my help as 			a friend. Kor is an old man. He 			has no family, no influence left 			in the Empire. He asked nothing 			except for the chance to fight 			and die as a Klingon warrior. I 			told him I would speak with you 			about finding him a command in 			the fleet.					MARTOK 			I would not give that man the 			gnawed bones of my last meal, 			much less command of a ship.					WORF 			But why? There's no blood feud 			between our Houses. And Kor told 			me he's never even met you.	Martok moves around the Bridge, old and bitter 	wounds prodding him with every step.					MARTOK 			You can wound a man without ever 			seeing his face. 				(beat)			When I was a boy, my family still 			lived in the lowlands of Ketha 			Province. We had very little, 			but it didn't matter -- we were a 			family of warriors. Fifteen 			generations had served the Empire 			as soldiers. My father had 			higher hopes for me -- he wanted 			his son to become an officer. It 			took a great deal of effort, but 			eventually he found someone 			willing to sponsor me. I passed 			the entrance exam on my first 			attempt. All that remained was 			final approval by the oversight 			council -- a simple formality. 				(beat)			But my application was rejected 			by one member of the council -- 			Kor.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More...

Kor is			"of the blood" -- born to rule by			the divine will of Kahless! And			what was I? A boy from the Ketha			lowlands. He couldn't bear the			thought of someone like me			joining the elite officer ranks.			So to my father's embarrassment			and my everlasting shame, my			application was denied. And with			the mark of Kor on my record I			couldn't even join as a common			soldier.				(beat) 			So I spent five years as a 			civilian laborer aboard General 			ShiVang's flagship.				(beat) 			As fortune would have it, the 			Romulans made a foolhardy attempt 			to board that ship, and I earned 			a battlefield commission. 			Unfortunately, my father did not 			live to see that glorious day. 			But if Kor'd had his way, I would 			still be a civilian on that 			ship... cleaning the officers' 			mess.	A long, quiet beat. Worf understands the depth of 	Martok's feelings, but he's already committed 	himself.					WORF			I... understand.				(beat) 			However... I must tell you that 			using my own authority, I 			appointed Kor an officer in the 			Ninth Fleet.	Martok turns and looks at him with a pained, 	betrayed expression.					MARTOK 			Made him an officer... just like 			that. That's the difference 			between his name and mine -- his 			opens doors, mine closes them.					WORF			I did not anticipate that you --      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More...

I want nothing 			to do with him.	Martok holds Worf's eyes for a moment, then EXITS.									CUT TO:11   INT. PROMENADE	Worf is walking down the Promenade, then sees EZRI 	and Kor having lunch at the Replimat.	Worf hesitates... nearly goes back the way he came, 	then charges ahead.					KOR 			Do you remember breaking into the 			Duke's harem on Renavi?					EZRI				(laughing)			How could I forget? It's one of			Curzon's favorite memories...	She looks up and is happy to see Worf.					EZRI 			Hi.					WORF				(stiff) 			Hello.					KOR 			Join us, my friend.	But Ezri knows how awkward this is for Worf.					EZRI 			I'm on duty. I'll see you later.	She claps his shoulder like an old comrade.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Once More...
