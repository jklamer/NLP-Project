REPLIMAT	BASHIR in mid-conversation with a beautiful BAJORAN WOMAN (a 	civilian).  She gazes at him dreamily as he tells his tale.					BASHIR			... So there I was, fighting the 			toughest battle of my life.  I looked 			around hoping to spot a friendly 			face... only to discover my colleagues 			were gone...				(a beat for dramatic 				effect)			I was... alone.	The Bajoran beauty hanging on his every word, nods 	sympathetically.2    NEW ANGLE	to include O'BRIEN, seated at a nearby table.  He can't decide 	what annoys him more, Bashir's "performance," or the women's 	moonstruck response.					BASHIR			I admit, for a moment there, I 			considered giving up.  I could feel 			the seconds ticking away... panic 			building up inside me.  I knew my 			only chance was to trust my instincts.  			I closed my eyes...				(he reenacts the moment)			... took a deep breath... and just 			like that it came to me.  The answer 			I was waiting for... A pericardial 			membrane.				(his eyes pop open)			I looked down and wrote it into my 			computer terminal, just as the buzzer 			sounded ending the exam.				(modestly)			And that, I suppose, is the stuff of 			which salutatorians are made.             DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/11/92 - TEASER             2.2    CONTINUED:					BAJORAN WOMAN				(only second?)			Salutatorian?					BASHIR				(minor setback)			I mistook a pre-ganglionic fiber for 			a post-ganglianic nerve during the 			orals or I would have been 			valedictorian.				(shrugs)			It was a trick question.	His companion is duly impressed.					BAJORAN WOMAN			Fascinating.					BASHIR				(smoothly)			Not nearly as fascinating as...					SISKO'S COM BADGE			Doctor Bashir... Chief O'Brien... 			report to landing pad five 			immediately.					BASHIR				(to woman)			Bad timing.					BAJORAN WOMAN				(very encouraging)			There'll be another time.	Bashir smiles, rises... so does O'Brien.  They make their 	way toward the Turbolift.					BASHIR				(to O'Brien)			Starfleet medical finals... gets 			them every time.	O'Brien's deadpan stare says it all.3    INT. LANDING PAD FIVE AIRLOCK	The Ganges is docked at the airlock.  SISKO and KIRA are 	using hand held suction-like clamps to pull open the 	Runabout's hatch.  They've gotten the clamps from a portable 	service module, which has been left near a half-repaired 	open panel.  They're unable to open the hatch.             DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/11/92 - TEASER             3.3    CONTINUED:					KIRA			It's no use.	O'Brien and Bashir ENTER the airlock, both wondering what's 	going on.					SISKO			Chief, we've got to get this hatch 			open.  Lieutenant Dax and Ensign 			Pauley are trapped in there.	O'Brien pops open a panel beside the hatch.					KIRA			The Runabout barely made it back 			through the wormhole.  By the time 			they docked, power levels were near 			zero.					O'BRIEN				(checking panel)			There's not even enough juice left 			in the ship to release the servos.	Bashir consults his medical tricorder.					BASHIR				(to Sisko)			Life support's down and oxygen levels 			have dropped dangerously low.	Kira whips out her phaser and points it at the hatch.					KIRA			We'll have to burn through.					SISKO			Forget it Major.  That hatch is made 			of duranium composite.  It would 			take you an hour to get through.					BASHIR				(re: tricorder)			We don't have that much time.				(a beat)			That's odd.				(to Sisko)			How many passengers did you say were 			on the Ganges?					SISKO			Two.             DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/11/92 - TEASER             4.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR			I'm reading three.	As Sisko reacts to the news...					O'BRIEN			We need to get power to the hatch 			servos.				(pointing to the 				service module)			Major, hand me that EPI capacitor.	Kira looks at the module, not quite sure what O'Brien means.					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			Top shelf, all the way to the left.	Kira finds the capacitor and hands it to him.					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			Stand clear.	O'Brien reaches into the Runabout panel and jury-rigs a 	connection.					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			Give her a go.	Kira hits the door panel.  The door slides partway open.  	There is a whoosh as air rushes in.  Sisko and Kira force it 	wide enough so that Bashir and O'Brien can ENTER.4    INT. RUNABOUT	They find DAX, Pauley and a Woman Passenger (lying face down 	on a console) slowly regaining consciousness.  Bashir goes 	to Dax, who waves him off.					DAX			I'm fine, check the others.	While Bashir examines Ensign Pauley, O'Brien helps the woman 	to her feet.  As she turns to O'Brien, he gives a look of 	startled recognition.             DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/11/92 - TEASER            4A.4    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Vash.	And sure enough it is VASH, Captain Picard's old flame from 	TNG.  She looks over at O'Brien, tries to place him.					VASH			That's right... ?             DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/11/92 - TEASER             5.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN			Miles O'Brien... From the Enterprise.	Vash, in weakened condition, makes a show of remembering.					VASH			Yes of course.					O'BRIEN			What are you doing on the Ganges?	Vash weakly tries to pick up a twenty-fourth century 	equivalent of a duffel bag... O'Brien moves to assist her, 	takes the bag for her.					DAX			We found her in the Gamma Quadrant.  			She's been there for over two years.					O'BRIEN				(reacts, glances at 				Sisko)			Two years... ?	Bashir supports a groggy Ensign Pauley.					SISKO			Doctor, we better get these people 			over to the Infirmary.	Bashir nods and leads them out of the ship.  O'Brien assists 	Vash.					BASHIR			Right this way.5    INT. LANDING PAD FIVE AIRLOCK	Out of the ship, they walk toward the exit, by a Starfleet 	Engineer (Enterprise-style uniform) who's got his head inside 	the panel beside the door, obviously attempting repairs...					O'BRIEN				(to Vash)			How did you get to the Gamma Quadrant 			two years ago?             DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/05/92 - TEASER             6.5    CONTINUED:					VASH				(a weak smile)			A friend dropped me off.	O'Brien reacts curiously.

In fact, you're in 			remarkable shape.					VASH			Thank you, Doctor.  I try.					BASHIR				(embarrassed)			I'd say you've managed quite well 			for someone who's been out of contact 			with civilization for over two years.					VASH			I'd hardly call the Gamma Quadrant 			uncivilized.  Some of the cultures 			I've encountered have histories dating 			back millions of years.					BASHIR				(fascinated)			Really... ?  I'd love to hear about 			them.  We have no idea what's beyond 			the wormhole...					VASH				(playful)			Perhaps I'll write a book...					BASHIR			It's certain to be a best-seller 			around here...				(completing the exam)			Well, no sign of disease or 			malnutrition, no parasitic 			infections...					VASH			You sound disappointed.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/09/92 - ACT ONE             8.7    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			I am.  Now I don't have any reason 			to keep you here.	Bashir puts away his medical tricorder.					VASH				(smiles)			You almost make me wish I wasn't 			feeling well.	Bashir smiles back.8    INT. COMMANDERS OFFICE	Dax is making her report to Sisko.					SISKO				(confirming)			... And she claims she knew nothing 			about the wormhole... ?					DAX			She was very surprised when I told 			her about it.  I don't think she 			ever expected to see this part of 			the galaxy again.					SISKO			How could she get there in the first 			place if she didn't go through the 			wormhole?					DAX			She didn't want to talk about it.  			Said it was a personal matter.					SISKO			This doesn't make sense.  A human 			alone in the Gamma Quadrant for two 			years.  Let's check her background.  			See what we can find out about her.					DAX			She claims to be an archaeologist.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/12/92 - ACT ONE             9.8    CONTINUED:					SISKO			That's a good place to start.	As he turns to access his desk monitor...9    EXT.

ASSAY OFFICE	Vash, her duffel bag on the counter, is speaking with a 	BAJORAN CLERK.					VASH			You're sure this place is safe?					BAJORAN CLERK			The Assay office is the most secure 			area on the station.	The Clerk opens one of the storage chambers.					BAJORAN CLERK				(continuing)			The chambers are surrounded on all 			sides by individual force fields.					VASH			How are the locks controlled?					BAJORAN CLERK			Once you secure a chamber, it can't 			be opened except with your personal 			authorization code, combined with a 			verified retinal print.					VASH				(probing)			Cardassian MK-seven scanner?	The Clerk looks offended at the mere suggestion.  MK-seven 	indeed.					BAJORAN CLERK			MK-twelve with an L-ninety enhanced 			resolution filter.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/11/92 - ACT ONE            10.11   CONTINUED:	Vash thinks about it.					VASH			I suppose it'll have to do.	Vash unzips the bag.  Vash takes a variety of artifacts out 	of her duffel and hands them one at a time to the Clerk, who 	looks over each object, then gives them to his Assistant, 	who puts them in the cubicle.					BAJORAN CLERK			Computer, begin inventory for cubicle 			nineteen.  One statue, stone, thirty-			odd centimeters tall, approximately 			twenty kilograms... Assorted gems... 			Gold necklace... One dagger, bronze 			and gold, about twenty-five 			centimeters.12   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	The Assistant puts away the dagger and Vash places a metal 	box on the counter.  Vash opens the container to REVEAL a 	beautiful GEODE glowing with a pulsing internal light.					BAJORAN CLERK				(continuing)			Beautiful.  I've never seen anything 			quite like it.  Some kind of 			Promethean Quartz?					VASH			That's what I thought at first, but 			it's molecular density and refraction 			index are much higher.					BAJORAN CLERK				(to Vash, admiring 				the Geode)			Remarkable.	Vash closes the box and hands it to the Clerk, who puts it 	away and closes the cubicle.					BAJORAN CLERK				(continuing, to 				computer)			End inventory.	He gives her a data clip.  The Assistant leaves.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/12/92 - ACT ONE            11.12   CONTINUED:					BAJORAN CLERK				(to Vash)			Please enter an access code.	She taps a combination into the clip.  The Clerk indicates a 	small eyepiece attached to the counter.  Vash places her eye 	against the scanner.  There's a slight hum as her retinal 	print is filed.					VASH				(once she's done)			I'll be back to pick everything up 			tomorrow.  I've booked passage on 			the Mulzirak Transport.13   NEW ANGLE	to include Sisko standing in the doorway.					SISKO			You're not leaving us so soon, are 			you?					VASH			I'm afraid so.	Sisko falls into step beside her as she EXITS the Assay 	office.14   INT.

We don't hear what 	they're saying, but the Assistant's surreptitious nod towards 	Vash lets up know the gist of their conversation.					VASH				(thoughtful)			So now the Daystrom Institute is 			interested in me.  That's ironic.					SISKO			Professor Woo seemed especially eager 			to speak to you again.					VASH			Did he really?  I suppose he told 			you that he suspended my membership 			from the Institute's Archaeological 			Council.					SISKO			On two occasions.  Something about 			the illegal sale of artifacts...					VASH			Let's just say when it comes to 			choosing between science and profit... 			I'll choose profit every time.					SISKO			I think the professor is hoping in 			this case you'll make an exception.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/09/92 - ACT ONE            13.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					VASH				(considering)			You know, I haven't been back to 			Earth in... it must be twelve years.					SISKO			Here's your chance.

THE GANGES	O'Brien finishes closing up some open panels as Sisko ENTERS.  	O'Brien looks up.					O'BRIEN			I don't understand it, Commander.  I 			can't find anything wrong with her.  			This ship's completely functional.					SISKO			It didn't look that way this morning.					O'BRIEN			Oh, don't get me wrong.  The power 			reserves are empty, the inertial 			damping fields are barely operating 			and the warp drive containment field 			is on the verge of collapse.					SISKO			But...					O'BRIEN			But there's nothing wrong with any 			of them.  Once we put power back 			into the Ganges, she should be fully 			operational.					SISKO			Did you check the central power 			linkages?            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/05/92 - ACT ONE            14.15   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Yes Sir.  I ran a level one 			diagnostic.  Everything checks out.  			I can't explain it.  It's like 			something tapped into the ship's 			systems and drained them dry.	He picks up his tools.  Sisko follows him out of the Runabout.16   INT. AIR LOCK	Sisko and O'Brien in motion.					SISKO			Tell me Chief, how well do you know 			this Vash woman?					O'BRIEN			Hardly at all.

We 			found it.					Q			And about time, too.68A  NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As Dax opens the box to reveal the Geode, now glowing brighter 	than ever.					QUARK				(closes the box)			Sorry, all transactions are final.  			This item now belongs to that 			gentleman over there.	Quark indicates Q, who disappears, much to Quark's 	consternation.  Dax studies the Geode with her tricorder...					DAX				(ignoring Quark)			I'm reading a massive graviton build 			up inside this container... it's 			increasing exponentially.  We've got 			to get it off the station now...	Sisko removes his combadge... hits it...	58A.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/12/92 - ACT FIVE          58A.68A  CONTINUED:					SISKO			Chief, lock on to my combadge... prepare 			to transport it five hundred meters 			off the docking ring...	Sisko tosses the combadge into the Geode container...					SISKO			Energize.	A transporter beam DEMATERIALIZES the box.68B  EXT. SPACE	The box materializes away from the station... suddenly it 	explodes into light...68C  INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL (OPTICAL)	Sisko, Dax, Kira and Vash come over the footbridge to the 	observation windows.  Through the windows, the bright flash 	spreads wider... and reactions as their faces reflect the 	light...69   OMITTED            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/12/92 - ACT FIVE           59.70   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	The brilliant flash of light becomes a WINGED ENERGY CREATURE.  	The Creature unfurls its wings and soars away.  It grows 	more and more distant until it disappears just as the wormhole 	IGNITES.70A  INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	All eyes on the observation windows as Sisko, Dax, Kira and 	Vash contemplate the wonders of the universe.71thru   OMITTED 7374   EXT.  DEEP SPACE NINE - STOCK (OPTICAL)	Everything back to normal.					SISKO (V.O.)			Station log, Stardate xxxxx.x.  With 			the embryonic lifeform off the 			station, graviton levels have returned 			to normal.  We've used the control 			thrusters to return the station to 			its original position.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/12/92 - ACT FIVE           60.75   INT. QUARK'S (OPTICAL)	Quark slides a drink across the bar to Vash.  In the back, 	we can see Dax, sitting and drinking coffee.					QUARK			So... you're off to the Daystrom 			Institute.  I bet you can hardly 			wait... Long boring lectures... 			Endless conferences... Whining 			students dogging your every step... 			Sounds delightful.				(a beat)			Of course...				(stops himself)			No, you wouldn't be interested.					VASH			In what?					QUARK				(leans close, whispers)			I hear they've uncovered the ruins 			of a Rokai provincial capital on 			Tartaras Five.  If you could obtain 			some Rokain artifacts...					VASH			Forget it, Quark.  I'm going back to 			Earth.	Quark goes to attend to other customers.					Q (O.S.)			An abysmal place.	Vash glances to one side.  Sure enough, Q has made an 	appearance.					VASH			Tartaras Five?					Q			Earth.  Don't get me wrong.  A 			thousand years ago it had 			character...            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/12/92 - ACT FIVE           61.75   CONTINUED:					Q (Cont'd)			The Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, 			Watergate.  But now... it's mind-			numbingly dull.					VASH			Please, by all means, don't come 			with me.					Q			Trust me, you'd be a lot happier 			poking around the ruins on 			Tartaras Five.					VASH			I don't need your advice.				(caught up for a moment)			You really think I...				(catching herself)			A beat.					Q			You know, I still feel I owe you 			a million bars of gold press 			latinum.					VASH			Keep it.  Just give me back my life.					Q			You'll regret it if I do.					VASH			I'm willing to take that chance.	Q smiles but there's a hint of melancholy we've never seen 	in him before.					Q				(finally giving up)			All right.  If you insist.  But things 			won't be the same without you.  When 			I look at a gas nebula, all I see is 			a cloud of dust, but seeing the 			universe through your eyes allowed 			me to experience... wonder.				(grumpy)			I'm going to miss that.					VASH			I guess, in some ways, I'm going to 			miss you too.	A beat as they exchange a silent good-bye.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/12/92 - ACT FIVE          61A.75   CONTINUED:	(2)					Q			Well, maybe I'll drop in on you 			sometime.            DEEP SPACE: "Q-Less" REV. 11/12/92 - ACT FIVE           62.75   CONTINUED:	(3)					VASH				(a friendly smile)			God, I hope not.	A beat.  Q smiles in understanding and DISAPPEARS.  Quark 	rejoins her.					VASH			So Quark, what's the quickest way to 			Tartaras Five?	Vash and Quark exchange a knowing grin and walk off together, 	speaking inaudibly as they plot strategy.  This is the 	beginning of a beautiful friendship.75A  ANGLE ON DAX	who watches Vash and Quark EXIT.  Dax shakes her head with a 	bemused expression.  She finishes her coffee and gets up to 	go, almost running into...75B  BASHIR	who has just entered the bar.					BASHIR				(yawning)			I feel like I've slept for days.				(a beat)			Did I miss something?	And on Dax's smile...75C  EXT.
