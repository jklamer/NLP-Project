WARDROOM	The room has been set up for a hearing. The large	conference table is gone and replaced with smaller	tables for the judge, defense, prosecution and a	witness chair. Flags of the Federation and Starfleet	stand off to one side. An antique ship's bell sits on	the judge's table. Sitting in the judge's chair is	Starfleet ADMIRAL T'LARA, an older female Vulcan in	dress uniform. At the prosecution table sits a Klingon	named CH'POK. At the defense table are SISKO and Worf,	both in dress uniforms. T'Lara strikes the bell three	times to open the hearing.					T'LARA			This hearing will come to order.			We are here to consider the			request of the Klingon Empire that			Lieutenant Commander Worf be			extradited for trial on charges of			murder.				(to Ch'Pok)			Advocate Ch'Pok, you may present			your charges.	Ch'Pok moves around the desk.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE        6.21   CONTINUED:					CHIPOK			The Klingon Empire makes the			following allegations against			Lieutenant Commander Worf: That			on Stardate 49648 while in command			of the Starship Defiant, he did			knowingly fire upon and destroy a			Klingon civilian transport ship			near the Pentath system. And as			a result of this action, four			hundred forty-one Klingon			civilians were killed.	Ch'Pok takes a few steps around the room.					CH'POK				(continuing)			It is my intention to prove that			Mister Worf was grossly negligent			in his command of the Defiant.			That his lust for battle overrode			his good judgement. I ask only			that he be returned to us... to			face the justice of his own 			people.				(beat)			Thank you.	He sits. Sisko stands.					SISKO			The Advocate neglected to mention			in his opening statement that at			the time in question, the Defiant			was under attack by two Klingon			warships. This was a combat			situation, with hundreds of lives			at stake. It was at that moment,			when the transport ship suddenly			decloaked in front of the Defiant.				(beat)			Worf gave the order to fire, not			because he was reckless or			negligent, but because he believed			he was firing on a warship. We			intend to show that the			destruction of the transport was			a tragic, but unavoidable,			accident.	Sisko sits.					T'LARA			I will hear formal evidence			beginning tomorrow afternoon at			fifteen hundred hours.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE        7.21   CONTINUED:	(2)	The Admiral reaches for the hammer to ring the bell.	Sisko speaks up:					SISKO			Admiral, I request that Commander			Worf be released from the holding			cell for the duration of this			hearing. I don't believe there's			any danger that he'll flee the			station.					T'LARA				(to Ch,Pok)			Is there an objection?	Ch'pok considers.					CH'POK			Captain Sisko is an honorable man.			I will accept his word.				(beat)			However, I would ask that Mister			Worf not be allowed to wear his			family baldric until this hearing			is over. He is dishonored among			our people, and I am... offended			by the sight of him wearing			Klingon emblems.	Worf bristles visibly. Sisko leans over.						SISKO				(sotto, a caution)			You want to stay in the holding			cell?	Worf finally relents, takes off his sash and lays it on	the table. Ch'Pok takes that victory with aplomb -- no	smile, just calm acceptance.					T'LARA			Very well. We will resume			tomorrow.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE        8.21   CONTINUED:	(3)	She rings the bell. T'Lara and Ch'Pok EXIT, leaving	Sisko and a seething Worf.					WORF			He is trying to provoke me.					SISKO			It looks like he's succeeding.			And I have a feeling that's not			the last time he's going to try to			get under your skin.	Worf takes a deep breath, knows Sisko's right, tries to	calm down, and nods.									CUT TO:22   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing the station.23   INT. PROMENADE	Sisko and Odo are walking along, mid-conversation.					SISKO			I want to know everything there is			to know about the Klingon who was			commanding that transport ship.					ODO			You suspect that he wasn't just on			an innocent passenger run...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE        9.23   CONTINUED:					SISKO			I intend to argue that he saw the			battle, and then decided to join			it... that he decloaked in order			to attack the Defiant.					ODO			Not the smartest decision he ever			made.					SISKO			That's where you come in. Use			your contacts in the Empire and			find out something about that			captain I can use. Was he			reckless, did he have a reputation			for drinking, did he have a			death wish? Something.					ODO			I'll see what I can do.	Odo peels off into a turbolift as Sisko keeps walking.	After a beat, Ch'Pok falls into step next to him.	Ch'Pok hands him a PADD.						CH'POK				(re: PADD)			The witnesses I intend to call.					SISKO				(glancing over PADD)			Thank you.					CH'POK			A remarkable station, Captain.					SISKO			Thank you. We don't get many			Klingon visitors anymore.					CH'POK			After this case is over, you might			be seeing a lot more of us.					SISKO			Oh?					CH'POK			When Worf is extradited, the			Federation will be forced to admit			that one of its officers committed			a massacre.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of ... " - REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE      10.23   CONTINUED:	(2)					CH'POK (Cont'd)			That'll put you on the defensive			throughout the quadrant. And			while you're busy trying to repair			a badly damaged reputation, we'll			find ourselves with certain...			opportunities.					SISKO			An opportunity to annex more of			Cardassian space and set up			additional military bases in this			sector.					CH'POK			Possibly. In any case, Worf is			about to hand us something we			could never win in battle --			sympathy. Any move we make			against you now will be seen as a			legitimate response to an			outrageous slaughter.					SISKO			You're presuming an awful lot.			Worf maintains his innocence.	Ch'Pok smiles.					CH'POK			And you are about to remind me			that the burden of proof is mine.			It's an interesting system of			justice you have. It does have			its flaws, however. It tends to			emphasize procedure over			substance... form over fact.					SISKO			I'm sorry if you feel it puts you			at a disadvantage.					CH'POK			On the contrary, I'm looking			forward to fighting on your terms.	They stop. Sisko looks at him.					SISKO			This isn't a fight. It's a search			for the truth.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of ... " - REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE     10A.23   CONTINUED:	(3)					CH'POK			The truth must be won. I'll see			you on the battlefield.	He smiles and walks off, leaving Sisko a little	disturbed...										CUT TO:24   INT. WARDROOM	Everyone in their places -- Admiral T'Lara, Sisko,	Worf. Ch'Pok on his feet, a Starfleet PADD in his	hand.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE          24   CONTINUED:					CH'POK			I have studied Commander Worf's			report, along with the Defiant's			sensor logs, and the reports of			the other officers on the bridge.				(beat)			And I believe every word of it.			It is a point of pride for the			Federation that Starfleet officers			never lie or commit fraud. So I			will accept the facts of this case			as they have been submitted.	T'Lara raises an eyebrow in surprise. Worf and Sisko	exchange a look.					SISKO			Admiral, if there are no facts in			dispute, then this hearing would			appear to be at an end.					CH'POK			We Klingons, are not concerned			with matters of fact and			circumstance... what matters to			us is what was in Worf's heart			when he gave the order to fire.			Was he just a Starfleet officer			doing his duty? Or was he a			Klingon warrior reveling in the			battle?				(beat)			That is why I am here. Because if			he was a Klingon lost in the			bloodlust of combat, then only we			can judge him... not you.					SISKO			We can't put a man's heart on			trial. It's a subjective issue			that cannot be reasoned in a court			of law. I ask that the advocate			be limited to arguing the evidence			in this case.					CH'POK			Someone told me that this was a			search for the truth. Should we			not follow that search wherever it			takes us?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE       12.24   CONTINUED:	(2)	A long beat as T'Lara considers the arguments.					T'LARA			The question of Commander Worf's			motive is relevant. I will allow			you to explore this issue but only			as far as logic permits.					CH'POK			I bow to your judgement.					T'LARA			You may call your first witness.									CUT TO:25   INT. WARDROOM 	A few minutes later. DAX is now in the witness chair	being questioned by Ch'Pok. T'Lara, Worf, and Sisko in	their places.					CH'POK			You're something of an expert on			Klingon society, aren't you,			Commander?					DAX			My previous host, Curzon, would			have called himself an expert. I			tend to think of myself as			having... a passing familiarity			with your culture.					CH'POK			In your opinion, as someone with			a "passing familiarity" with our			culture, wouldn't you say that			Klingons are a violent, warrior			race?					DAX			Yes. There is that aspect to your			people.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " - REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE      13.25   CONTINUED:					CH'POK			Would you agree that one of the			things that makes a Klingon			warrior formidable is his...			predatory instincts? His			"bloodlust," if you will?					DAX			I'd agree with that.					CH'POK			Now, when Worf was on the Defiant,			engaged in combat... don't you			think his "predatory instincts"			took over?					DAX			I think those instincts were			present. But I've seen Worf			restrain them before.					CH'POK			You have? When?					DAX			In the holosuite. We've fought			many times.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE       14.25   CONTINUED:	(2)					CH'POK			You mean, you've practiced with			Mister Worf. You've played with			him...					DAX			Oh, no. When Worf and I fight...			we fight.26   INT. HOLOSUITE CAVES - FLASHBACK 	CLANG! Dax and Worf are in the middle of a heated	fight with mek'leths in the caves. They're really	throwing themselves into it and are both wearing	workout gis. The action is fast and furious as we hear	Dax's voice from the wardroom.					DAX'S VOICE			I've made it very clear to Worf			that I never want him to take it			easy on me, because I'm a woman,			or a Trill.27   INT. WARDROOM	as before.					CH'POK			Have you ever been injured?					DAX			A few bruises here and there... a			broken finger once... nothing			serious. And I've given him a few			lumps of his own.28   INT. HOLOSUITE CAVES - FLASHBACK	Dax sweeps Worf's feet out from under him, and he	CRASHES to the cave floor.					CH'POK'S VOICE			So you're not afraid of Mister			Worf?	Dax tries to go in for the kill, but Worf is faster.	He disarms her with a quick move, SLAMS her back into	the cave wall and puts his mek,leth to her throat. He	glares at her face, breathing heavily, snarling.	Dax then turns to the camera and breaks the "fourth	wall" between her and the wardroom.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " - REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE      15.28   CONTINUED: 	This is her flashback and Worf pays no attention to the	courtroom dialog.					DAX				(breathless)			I'm no fool. I can see the killer			instinct in his eyes... and I know			he can kill me if he wants to...				(beat)			But that look always goes away...			he knows when to stop.	The snarl disappears off Worf's face. He steps back	and pulls the Bat'leth away from her neck. She bows to	him, acknowledging defeat...29   INT. WARDROOM	Ch'Pok nods thoughtfully, moves back to the table and	picks up a PADD, looks it over. Dax glances at Worf,	who gives her an appreciative look. Ch'pok turns back	to the others.					CH'POK				(off PADD)			Admiral... at this time, I would			like to introduce into evidence			files I obtained from the			defendant's private database this			morning.					SISKO			Objection. There's been no search			order issued for those files.			This is a violation of Mister			Worf's privacy.					T'LARA				(to Ch'Pok)			The captain is correct. Without			a properly executed search order,			or the permission of the			defendant, any information you			have accessed from his private			database may not be admitted as			evidence.					CH'POK			Ah... I see. Well, I obviously			have no search order...	Ch'Pok walks over to the defendant's table.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of REV. 1/26/96 - ACT ONE         16.29   CONTINUED:					CH'POK			So I ask you, Worf. May I enter			these files into evidence? Or do			you have something to hide?	He sets the PADD in front of Worf, who barely glances	at it.					SISKO				(sotto, to Worf)			Don't play his game.	But Ch'Pok and Worf have locked eyes. There's an	implicit challenge from Ch'Pok here -- a challenge that	Worf cannot pass up.					WORF			I have nothing to hide.

Were you excited?					WORF			Of course. I am a Klingon. We			live for battle.					SISKO			So that's all that mattered to			you... the chance to fight?					WORF			No, sir. Whatever my personal			feelings may be, I do not allow			them to interfere with duty or my			professional judgement.					SISKO			Mister Worf... Chief O'Brien says			he disagrees with your decision to			fire. How do you respond to that?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " - REV. 1/26/96 - ACT FOUR      43.62   CONTINUED:					WORF			I respect the Chief's opinion. We			have served together for many			years. He's an outstanding			officer... and a friend. However,			he was not in command that day.					SISKO			What difference does that make?					WORF			It makes all the difference. He			is looking back at a decision...			analyzing it weeks later. As the			commanding officer of the Defiant,			it was my duty to look forward...			to anticipate every possible			situation.					SISKO			Did you anticipate encountering a			civilian ship on this mission?					WORF			I knew that our convoy would be			passing through civilian shipping			lanes. But, in my judgement, the			chances of a civilian vessel			decloaking in the middle of a			battle were... remote. I decided			that if we were engaged in			combat... I would not hesitate to			fire at a decloaking ship.					SISKO			Mister Worf, I want you to think			about the civilians who died on			that transport ship... and answer			one question.				(beat)			Given the same set of			circumstances, would you do it			again?					WORF			Yes, sir. If I had hesitated, I			would have been negligent. I			would have been risking my ship,			my crew and the entire convoy.					SISKO			Thank you.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of...

Ch'Pok stands and takes a	few steps around the room.					CH'POK			Worf... why are you considered an			outcast among the Klingons?					WORF			I sided with the Federation during			the invasion of Cardassia. For			that, Chancellor Gowron stripped			me of my honor and my family name.					CH'POK			So you acted out of conscience,			and you were punished for it. How			do you feel about that? Are you			angry... bitter?	Worf thinks about this, trying to choose his words	carefully.					WORF			I am angry about the treatment I			received. It was unjust.					CH'POK			Of course you are. Who wouldn't			be? What happened affected your			whole family... the entire House			of Mogh was brought down. Your			brother ejected from the High			Council in disgrace... your lands			seized... and now your son			Alexander will bear the stigma of			being the son of a traitor.				(beat)			Did I miss anything?					WORF			No.					CH'POK			Worf... in your opinion... what do			they think of you in the Empire?					WORF			I am... hated.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of...

Because of what you did?					WORF			Yes.					CH'POK			Are you sure it's not something			more basic?					WORF			What is that supposed to mean?					CH'POK			Isn't it obvious? You were raised			by humans on Earth. And now you			wear their uniform. Haven't you			always been a traitor in your			heart?	Worf can't help but start to bristle. Ch'Pok is	starting to push some buttons.					WORF			No.					CH'POK				(incredulous)			Are you trying to tell us that you			live with humans... but your heart			is Klingon?					WORF			Yes.					CH'POK			But if your heart is Klingon, how			could you fire upon your own			people?					WORF			They fired the first shot. When			that happened, they became my			enemies.					CH'POK			Then why aren't you glad that you			destroyed that transport? It was			filled with your enemies and their			children.					WORF			There is nothing honorable about			killing those who cannot defend			themselves.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of... " - REV. 1/26/96 - ACT FOUR      47.62   CONTINUED:	(4)					CH'POK			Are you telling me that you would			never attack a defenseless			opponent?					WORF			No. I would not.	Ch'pok looks at him, a little puzzled.					CH'POK			Maybe I've been wrong about you.			Maybe you aren't Klingon in your			heart. A true Klingon would			rejoice at the death of his			enemies. Armed, unarmed, old,			young. All that matters is the			victory.				(beat)			Worf... did you weep for those			children?					WORF			I... grieve for them.					CH'POK			Grieve? A Klingon doesn't grieve.			They died in a glorious battle!			They're with the honored dead in			Sto-Vokor! They don't want your			grief. You dishonor their memory!					SISKO			Objection!					T'LARA				(a warning)			Advocate...	But neither Ch'Pok nor Worf pays attention to Sisko or	T'Lara. They've locked eyes -- passion rising in each	of them. Two men on a collision course and nothing can	stop them.					WORF			You will say anything... you have			no honor!					CH'POK			I say this: You live with humans			because you're afraid to live with			Klingons.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of...

And if you would			like to pick up a bat'leth and			face me with a weapon instead of			words, I will prove it to you.					CH'POK			You'd like that, wouldn't you,			Worf? You'd love to prove that			you're just as strong and			courageous as any Klingon warrior.					T'LARA			Advocate, you are stepping well			beyond the bounds of protocol.					WORF				(overlapping, heated)			I am a Klingon warrior.					CH'POK			And that's why you told the			Ferengi you hoped the Klingons			would come for you. You wanted to			prove yourself in the eyes of the			only people that matter to you.			Other Klingons.					T'LARA			This will stop! Or I will hold			both of you in contempt.	Ch'Pok pulls back, but the rage and fire in Worf's eyes	are not so easily contained.					CH'POK				(quiet)			I apologize, Worf... actually I			pity you. But you know who I pity			more? Alexander. Because some			day he will turn to you and say,			"Father... who am I?" And you'll			have to tell him that he is the			son of a small, frightened man who			destroyed a ship full of children			just to prove his own courage.	Worf explodes, lunges at Ch'pok!      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of...

He falls to	the deck, blood trickling from his mouth. A breathless	moment in the room as Sisko pulls Worf away. Worf	struggles to get a grip on himself.					CH'POK			I thought you said you'd never			attack an unarmed man.	Worf doesn't have an answer. Ch'Pok finally gets up.					CH'POK			Maybe you should have said... not			unless I get angry... not unless			I have something to prove.				(beat)			I rest my case.	OFF the stunned look on Worf's face as he realizes what	he's done... and that Ch'Pok may just be right.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rules of...

Would you agree			that at the moment, it's difficult			for us to trust each other?					CH'POK			Difficult, but not impossible.			There are things which transcend			the differences between us. For			example, we trust that this case			will be decided fairly. We have			faith in Admiral T'Lara's			judgement.	Ch'Pok smiles pleasantly at Sisko.					SISKO			I'm glad to hear you have such a			profound respect for the Admiral.			But would it be fair to say that			outside this hearing... you do not			entirely trust us?	Ch'Pok studies him for a moment, wondering where this	is going, and trying to be cautious.					CH'POK			It is... only prudent that we...			question your motives now that we			are no longer allies.					SISKO			Of course. And it would only be			prudent for us to question your			motives.
