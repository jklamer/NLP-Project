OPS	KIRA, O'BRIEN, DAX, BASHIR, and ODO are gathered around the 	Ops table.  Everyone is watching Kira as she reads a PADD.  	The mood is grim.  Kira finally puts her PADD down with a 	somber expression... she looks around at the other officers 	for a beat.  When she speaks, it is without rancor or 	recrimination... she is simply stating her position with 	quiet determination.					KIRA			We're in trouble, people.	The others exchange weary looks... they've clearly been at 	this for a long time.					KIRA				(continuing)			We've run seven simulations, and 			they've all come up the same: the 			Jem'Hadar overwhelm our defenses and 			board the station within two hours.					BASHIR			Two hours doesn't even give us time 			to get reinforcements from Bajor.					DAX			There must be something we've 			overlooked.	They all look at each other, hoping that someone else will 	come up with a brilliant plan, but finally O'Brien speaks 	for them all.          DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/08/94 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(to Kira)			Major, I'm the last one to say it's 			hopeless... but given D.S. Nine's 			structural limitations... our 			available power supply... and the 			difficulty of defending a stationary 			target against a heavily armed mobile 			force... I'd say two hours is 			optimistic.					BASHIR			Regardless of the time, our casualties 			would be appalling.	Kira looks frustrated... she paces around for a moment, 	finally turns to Odo.					KIRA			All right... let's say we let them 			board the station.  That still doesn't 			mean we have to surrender.					DAX			What are you suggesting?					KIRA			We can hide in the conduits... set 			up booby-traps... prepare ambushes... 			try and hold out until we can get 			reinforcements.					ODO			We can try... but I don't think 			there would be much of a station left 			by the time they got here.	Kira takes this news stoically... she paces around more, 	trying to think.					DAX			That leaves us with two options: 			abandon the station and make a stand 			on Bajor... or collapse the entrance 			to the wormhole.					KIRA			I want a third alternative... I refuse 			to believe that we can't--          DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/08/94 - TEASER        3-5.2    CONTINUED:	(2)	Suddenly an ALARM sounds on Dax's console.					DAX				(off console)			Some kind of large subspace surge 			just activated our security sensors.					KIRA			Where is it?					DAX			Bearing one four eight, mark two one 			five.  Distance: three hundred meters.          DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/08/94 - TEASER        3-5.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					O'BRIEN				(shocked)			Three hundred meters?  That's almost 			inside our shield perimeter.					DAX			From the intensity and the harmonic 			signature, it might be a cloaked 			ship, but I've never seen an energy 			dispersal pattern like this.					KIRA			It's too close for comfort, whatever 			it is.  Red Alert.  Raise shields, 			energize phaser banks, stand-by to 			lock --					DAX				(urgent, off console)			The energy signature's fluctuating... 			it's decloaking.3    OMITTED4    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	A small starship DECLOAKS near the space station.  This is 	the USS DEFIANT -- an experimental ship that Starfleet never 	put into full production.  The ship should look a little 	clunky compared to other Federation vessels we've seen -- 	this ship was built primarily for battle, not exploration or 	science.5    INT. OPS (OPTICAL)	Everyone is looking at the Defiant, which is on the main 	viewer.          DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/20/94 - TEASER          7.5    CONTINUED:					DAX				(off console)			It's definitely a Federation 			starship... but I've never seen this 			design.					O'BRIEN			A Federation ship... with a cloaking 			device?	Dax reacts to something on her console.					DAX			They're hailing us.	Kira nods to Dax, who then works her console.  The image of 	the Defiant is now replaced by that of SISKO, who is sitting 	on the Bridge of the Defiant.					SISKO			Hello, Major.  Sorry to startle you, 			but I wanted to test the Defiant's 			cloaking device.					KIRA			The Defiant?					SISKO			I've brought back a little surprise 			for the Dominion.	Off their reactions...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE          8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)6    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE & DEFIANT (OPTICAL)	The Defiant is docked at the station.7    INT. WARDROOM (OPTICAL)	The Wardroom is a room which has undergone a renovation since 	Starfleet took over the station.  While the basic architecture 	is clearly Cardassian, the furniture and decor are more in 	the comfortable, ergonomic Federation vein.  There are 	comfortable chairs, a couch or two, some small end tables, 	and one large table which can be used for formal meetings.  	One end is dominated by a viewer and computer console.	Kira, O'Brien, Dax, Bashir and ODO are looking at a Okudagram 	schematic diagram of the Defiant on one of the monitors.  	Sisko is standing next to the monitor.					SISKO				(re: monitor)			Officially she's classified as an 			escort vessel... unofficially the 			Defiant's a warship.  Nothing more, 			nothing less.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE          9.7    CONTINUED:					KIRA			I thought Starfleet didn't believe 			in warships.					SISKO			Desperate times breed desperate 			measures.  Five years ago, Starfleet 			began exploring the possibility of 			building a new class of starship.  			This ship would have no families, no 			science labs, no luxuries of any 			kind... it was designed for one 			purpose only -- to fight and defeat 			the Borg.				(beat)			The Defiant was the prototype... the 			first ship in what would've been a 			new Federation battle fleet.					DAX			So what happened?					SISKO			The Borg threat became less urgent. 			Also, some design flaws cropped up 			during the ship's shakedown cruise, 			so Starfleet decided to abandon the 			project.					O'BRIEN			What sort of... design flaws?					SISKO			You'll have complete access to the 			ship evaluation reports, but to put 			it simply... it's overgunned and 			overpowered for a ship its size.  			During battle drills, it nearly tore 			itself apart when the engines were 			tested at full capacity.					KIRA				(incredulous)			And this is the ship Starfleet 			sent us to fight off an attack by 			the Dominion?   20:[1,#b],87:[1,#b],96:[1,#b],98:[1,#b]         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE         10.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			We're not going to fight the Dominion, 			Major.  At least, not yet.				(beat)			Our mission is to take the Defiant 			into the Gamma Quadrant and try to 			find the leaders of the Dominion -- 			the "Founders."  We have to convince 			them that the Federation represents 			no threat to them.					BASHIR			What if they don't believe us?					SISKO			That's why I asked for the Defiant.  			She may have flaws, but she has teeth.  			I want the Dominion to know that we 			can and will defend ourselves if 			necessary.	This seems to impress everyone... even Kira looks a little 	more positive about the Defiant.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE         11.7    CONTINUED:	(3)	The doors OPEN and a female Romulan officer named T'RUL, 	and a Starfleet Security officer named EDDINGTON ENTER.					EDDINGTON				(to Sisko)			I've posted two security officers at 			the Defiant's docking port, sir.  No 			one'll get near the cloaking device 			without us knowing about it.					ODO				(bristling)			I wasn't informed about any special 			security needs.					T'RUL			The security arrangements were made 			at my request... to protect the 			cloaking device.	Sisko steps in before Odo can respond.					SISKO			A few introductions are in order.				(to others)			This is Subcommander T'Rul of the 			Romulan Empire.  She is here to 			operate the cloaking device which 			her government has so kindly loaned 			us for this mission.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE         12.7    CONTINUED:	(4)					T'RUL				(simply)			Romulan interests will be served 			through cooperation.  And my role is 			to keep "unauthorized personnel"...				(pointedly looks at 				each of them)			... away from the cloaking device.	She regards them all with open suspicion.  Sisko tries to 	smooth the waters a bit.					SISKO				(to T'Rul)			May I present my officers... this is 			Major Kira Nerys--					T'RUL				(curt)			Thank you, but I know their names, 			and I'm not here to make friends.	She EXITS.					KIRA			Charming.	Eddington gives them a slightly embarrassed smile and sticks 	out a hand toward Kira.					EDDINGTON			Well, I am here to make friends.  			I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael 			Eddington, Starfleet Security.					KIRA				(shakes his hand)			Major Kira Nerys.	Eddington now looks to Odo, who regards him with something 	less than warmth.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE         13.7    CONTINUED:	(5)					ODO			Odo... Head of station security.				(beat)			May I ask what your... function is 			here, Commander?	Eddington reacts with a slight look of surprise and he looks 	to Sisko, who clearly has not been looking forward to this.  	Odo picks up on the look between the two men and his 	displeasure deepens.					SISKO				(to all)			There'll be a complete mission 			briefing at eighteen hundred hours, 			but be prepared to depart the station 			at oh-seven-hundred tomorrow morning.  			Dismissed.	Odo makes no move to leave as the others all EXIT.  Sisko 	waits until they're gone and then turns to Odo, who is waiting 	for him.					ODO			You needn't brace yourself to give 			me unpleasant news, Commander, I'll 			save you the trouble:  I've been 			relieved as Chief of Security.	Odo turns on his heel and stalks out of the room.  Sisko 	goes after him.7A   INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS	Sisko catches up with Odo just outside the Wardroom.					SISKO			Odo, wait.  You have not been 			relieved.  You're still in charge of 			all non-Starfleet security matters 			aboard this station.					ODO			What about matters that are Starfleet?					SISKO			In those areas, you'll coordinate 			your efforts with Commander Eddington.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE        13A.7A   CONTINUED:					ODO			"Coordinate" is another way of saying, 			"I'll report to him."         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE         14.7A   CONTINUED:   (2)   	Sisko can't deny that what Odo's saying is true.  Odo heads 	down the Corridor again, but Sisko won't let it go at that.  	He follows and tries to make a personal connection.					SISKO			I'm sorry, Odo.  This wasn't my idea.					ODO			I'm sure it wasn't.  You're just... 			following orders.					SISKO			An order I strongly disagreed with.  			I did everything I could to fight 			this... I even took it to the Chief 			of Starfleet Security herself.  But 			their decision... was final.	Odo's eyes smolder in anger and he stops and turns on Sisko.					ODO			May I ask why?					SISKO			They had some... concerns regarding 			several recent security breaches.					ODO			If I was given the authority I asked 			for, instead of being tied to 			Starfleet regulations, there wouldn't 			have been any security breaches.					SISKO			Odo, your resistance to following 			Starfleet regulations is part of the 			problem.					ODO			I think there might be a simpler 			explanation, Commander.  Starfleet 			decided to bring in someone they 			could trust... someone besides "the 			shape-shifter."         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE        14A.7A   CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO			This is not a racial issue, Odo.

I 			don't require your understanding.  			My resignation will be logged within 			the hour.	Odo turns and EXITS.  Sisko sits back, frustrated by the 	fact that there's very little he can do in this situation.									CUT TO:8    EXT.

As he passes the entrance to the bar, 	Quark sees Odo through the door and quickly runs out to catch 	up with him.					QUARK			Constable!  Constable a moment of 			your time please!  Odo, wait!	Quark is the last guy Odo wants to see right now, but he 	reluctantly stops in place and turns to Quark with a no-	nonsense look on his face.					ODO			What is it, Quark?	Quark pulls up short at the tone and look on Odo's face.					QUARK			I just wanted to see if... if it's 			true.					ODO			If that's your way of asking if I've 			been relieved, then the answer is 			yes.  I'm sure that makes you very 			happy, so now I'll stand here and 			patiently wait for you to finish 			gloating.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/11/94 - ACT ONE         16.9    CONTINUED:	Odo adopts a "go ahead and laugh" attitude and stands 	waiting for Quark to respond.  Quark is definitely taken 	aback by the situation and scrambles for a reply.					QUARK			I'm not here to... gloat.					ODO			Then if you'll excuse me.	Odo turns to go, but Quark falls into step with him, not 	quite willing to let it go at that.					QUARK			What happened?					ODO			Starfleet has sent their own security 			officer, a Lieutenant Commander 			Eddington.  He'll be in charge as of 			this afternoon.					QUARK			A Starfleet officer... but why?  How 			did this happen?  What does Commander 			Sisko say about this?	Odo stops short and Quark nearly piles into him.  Odo peers 	at Quark closely.					ODO			Why are you so concerned?  You'll 			have a brand new security chief to 			deal with... one that's not as 			familiar with you and your venal 			ways.  You should be celebrating, 			Quark.					QUARK			On the contrary... this upsets my 			entire operation.					ODO			How so?					QUARK			You were good... you kept me on my 			lobes... you made sure I didn't get 			lazy and careless.

SISKO'S QUARTERS	JAKE is eating a heaping bowl of I'danian spice pudding at 	the table and thoroughly enjoying himself.  There are several 	open suitcases in the room, some with clothes and personal 	belongings still in them, others have been emptied, but the 	contents not put away.  There is also a large shipping crate 	sitting on the floor.  The door OPENS and Sisko ENTERS.  He 	looks around in a little surprise.					SISKO			I thought you were unpacking.					JAKE				(sheepish)			I am... I mean, I was.  But I just 			kept looking at the replicator... 			and thinking... and...					SISKO				(with a smile)			And you just had to have some I'danian 			spice pudding.					JAKE			I still can't believe I couldn't get 			a decent bowl of it back on Earth.					SISKO				(with humor)			That didn't stop you from ordering 			it at every replicator you saw.	Jake takes another heaping spoonful as Sisko begins unpacking 	some of his own clothes from one of the suitcases.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/08/94 - ACT ONE         18.10   CONTINUED:					SISKO			So is it good to be home?					JAKE			Yeah...

Sisko jumps up and moves quickly to Jake.					SISKO			Careful.

SHUTTLECRAFT	Kira is sitting in the cockpit next to Odo, who is calmly 	piloting the ship.					KIRA				(weakly)			Where... where am I?         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/13/94 - ACT FIVE        63.60   CONTINUED:					ODO			You're in a Shuttlecraft, and you've 			been wounded so try not to move 			around.	Kira touches the bruise and winces.  Then memory floods back 	and she reacts in concern.					KIRA			Odo, what happened?  We were under 			attack...	During the following conversation, Odo never takes his eyes 	off something on the console in front of him.  Odo is 	conflicted here... he's focused on whatever he sees on the 	console, but Kira is also his friend and he's hoping that 	she'll understand and support what he's done.					ODO			The ship was boarded, and you were 			wounded in the attack.  I managed to 			get us to this shuttlecraft, but I 			don't know much more than that.  The 			last time I saw the Defiant she was 			dead in space and surrounded by 			Jem'Hadar ships.	Kira is shocked at this news and tries to take it all in.					KIRA			Sisko?  Bashir?					ODO			I don't know.	Kira takes another beat and lets that sink in.					KIRA			Where are we?					ODO			Approaching the Omarion Nebula.	Kira gives him a sharp look.					KIRA			You should have taken us back to the 			wormhole.					ODO			You didn't object at the time.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/13/94 - ACT FIVE        64.60   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			I was unconscious.	Kira decides to drop it.					KIRA			Have you found anything?	Odo continues to stare at the console and nods slowly.  Kira 	sits up a little to see what he's looking at.  She reads the 	monitor and acts a little surprised.					KIRA				(off console)			There's a class-M planet ahead, but 			no star system.  A rogue planet?					ODO				(quiet)			Yes.61   EXT. SPACE - SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)	The Shuttlecraft heads for the dark planet.  (NOTE: there's 	no star present to shine light on the surface.)									CUT TO:62   EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT	A strange and beautiful alien setting.  The Shuttlecraft has 	landed in a small clearing on the edge of what seems to be a 	forest.         DEEP SPACE: "THE SEARCH" - REV. 07/19/94 - ACT FIVE        65.62   CONTINUED:	Since this planet has no sun it is ALWAYS NIGHT here.  	Kira and Odo EXIT the shuttle and step outside.  Kira looks 	around in curiosity.  Odo's gaze is fixed on something o.c.  	Odo walks toward what he's looking at and Kira follows him.63   EXT. LAKESHORE (OPTICAL) - NIGHT	Odo is walking toward the edge of what appears to be a large 	GELATINOUS LAKE.  The lake appears to be made of something 	other than water.  The surface undulates and roils in an 	unnatural fashion.  Odo stops at the edge.  Kira stands next 	to him and there is a long moment as Odo looks down at the 	strange liquid.	Suddenly a portion of the lake begins to MORPH.  As Odo and 	Kira watch in amazement, a group of FOUR SHAPE-SHIFTERS 	detach themselves from the lake and take on the form of FOUR 	HUMANOIDS.  Their faces have the same "unfinished" look that 	Odo's does and they appear to wear simple tunics.  One FEMALE 	shapeshifter smiles at Odo and steps towards him.					FEMALE			Welcome home.	Off Odo's reaction...									FADE OUT.	SUPER:			TO BE CONTINUED                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
