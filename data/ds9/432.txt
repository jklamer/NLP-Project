QUARK'S	We begin with a close angle on a small, iridescent disc in 	Quark's hand.  He turns it over and over as he talks.					QUARK (O.S.)			I am merely a businessman.  It would 			take an orator with the skills of 			the late, great Plegg himself, to 			sing the praises of the late, great 			Plegg.	We widen to see that QUARK is in the midst of a sales pitch 	to a curious fellow Ferengi at the bar.  The disc he is 	holding is a Ferengi "Memorial Disc." Near him is a 	ceremonially decorated box full of these discs.  Perhaps 	there are two or three others gathered to watch this.					QUARK				(continuing)			What Ferengi could resist the honor 			of owning a small piece of the man 			who took a computer chip and turned 			it into the modular holosuite 			industry... a small piece of the man 			who brought holographic entertainment 			to the most remote parts of this 			quadrant, creating profit centers 			from societies that could barely 			afford to feed their own people...	ODO arrives quietly joining the sales pitch...					ODO				(re: the disc)			How much are you asking?	Quark reacts, knowing Odo is here to screw up his pitch...					QUARK			As I was about to tell my good friend 			here, a mere three strips of 			latinum...        DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - REV. 10/28/93 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED:	The Ferengi hears the price and immediately walks... 	calling after him...					QUARK			And I'd be taking a loss at that 			price... okay, for you, two strips...				(sighs, he's lost 				him, to odo)			Thank you very much.					ODO			Three strips?  That's a fair price 			for Plegg.					QUARK				(reacts)			I suppose you're interested.					ODO			Humanoid death rituals are an interest 			of mine.					QUARK			Death rituals.					ODO			Everybody needs a hobby.					QUARK				(dubious)			Uh huh...					ODO			Some species burn their dead, others 			pack them in blocks of ice... some 			even surround themselves with the 			company of family corpses.  But the 			Ferengi ritual of chopping up their 			loved ones and selling them... I 			find that... irresistible.					QUARK				(not buying)			I'm very busy here.					ODO				(pursuing him)			What a fitting and dignified way to 			honor the memory of great Ferengi 			entrepreneurs.  I'm thinking of 			starting a collection.           DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - 10/27/93 - TEASER           3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO			Putting up a display case in my 			office.  There'll be a special space 			reserved for you in there, Quark.					QUARK			I'm sure.	Odo puts three strips of latinum on the bartop... and that 	really stops Quark.					QUARK			You're serious?					ODO			Have you ever known me not to be?	Quark's waiting for the payoff to the gag... he hesitantly 	takes the money and begins to slide the disc across the bar 	to Odo...					ODO			Oh, there is one thing I was curious 			about...					QUARK				(knows something's 				coming)			And what's that...					ODO			How do I know it's Plegg?					QUARK			It says so on the label.					ODO			Isn't there some sort of letter of 			authenticity?					QUARK				(pointing)			The Ferengi Seal of Dismemberment is 			right there.  What more do you want?					ODO			I want Plegg.					QUARK			You've got him!        DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - REV. 11/12/93 - TEASER         4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO			Not if he's still alive...					QUARK				(a beat)			Still alive?					ODO			Still alive.					QUARK				(aghast)			Plegg?					ODO			When I tracked him down on Khosla 			Two and told him about your little 			scheme, he was quite amused.  I'm 			not.	Odo takes back his latinum strips.					QUARK			Odo, I'm a victim here.  I bought 			these discs in good faith.  I have 			five thousand pieces of Plegg in my 			storeroom.					ODO			Not Plegg.					QUARK			Then who?					ODO			Good question.					QUARK			I demand an investigation...					ODO			You'll get one.  I promise you.					MORA (O.S.)			Odo...	Odo turns to the voice and reacts as he sees...2    ANGLE	Doctor MORA POL, standing there, smiling at him.					ODO				(surprised)			Doctor Mora...        DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - REV. 10/28/93 - TEASER         5.2    CONTINUED:					MORA			It's been too long.	He sticks his hand out and Odo shakes it, definitely 	uncomfortable... especially with Quark there to observe.					MORA			You're looking well.  Yes, coming 			along nicely.					ODO			Why didn't you let me know you were 			coming?					MORA			It was a last minute arrangement.					ODO			The trip from Bajor takes five hours.					QUARK				(terribly curious)			Ah, can I get you something... Doctor 			"Mora" was it?					MORA			Yes.  Some Deka tea would be nice...	Quark goes to work...					MORA				(in studying Odo)			You haven't quite managed the ears, 			yet, have you?  But, they're 			difficult.  Is the suit a suit, or 			part of you?  And what about the 			boots?	Quark arrives with tea...					QUARK			There we are... nice and hot...					MORA			Thank you...	Quark lingers, Odo waits for him to leave... but Quark can't 	resist...        DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - REV. 10/28/93 - TEASER         6.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			So...				(beat)			You two seem to be old friends...					ODO				(getting it over with)			Doctor Mora is the Bajoran scientist 			who was assigned to me after I was 			found.					MORA				(with pride)			I was personally responsible for his 			development during his formative 			years.					QUARK			Then, this is a family reunion!  I 			had a hunch... well, Odo's dad is 			always welcome in Quark's... the tea 			is on the house...			MORA   				ODO		Well, actually...			He isn't my...	But Quark doesn't hear their denials beginning... he blows 	through it... continuing...					QUARK				(to Mora)			I know he wouldn't tell you himself.  			But Odo is doing a wonderful job 			here on the station if I may say 			so...					MORA			Is he...					QUARK			Absolutely.  As a matter of fact, 			when you came in, he was just 			beginning a fraud investiga...					ODO				(interrupting)			Quark!				(Quark turns to him)			Excuse us.	He pulls Mora away from the bar.           DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - 10/27/93 - TEASER           7.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK				(calling after them)			Of course.  You two have a lot of 			catching up to do.  If there's 			anything I can help you with, Doctor, 			don't hesitate to call on me.	Odo and Mora EXIT.2A   INT. PROMENADE	Mora is studying Odo carefully, picks up none of the 	discomfort that Odo is feeling.  But it is important to note 	that Mora is extremely likeable in every casual way possible.  	He has a warm sense of humor, is outgoing with people and 	even with Odo, he is comfortable in a superficial way.  But 	there is no intimacy from him toward Odo.  No personal 	relationship.  More of what you'd expect from a business 	relationship.  In fact, he is a scientist.   And Odo is his 	specimen.					MORA			That was uncalled for.					ODO			You don't know Quark.					MORA			I know he was trying very hard to 			present you in a positive light to 			someone he thought was important to 			you and you responded with...					ODO				("don't lecture me" 				implied)			Please...					MORA			Still having trouble with social 			integration... ?					ODO			I integrate as much as I want to.					MORA			Define "as much as I want to."           DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - 10/27/93 - TEASER          7A.2A   CONTINUED:					ODO			"As much as I want to" means as much 			as I want to.				(already tired of 				this, a last defense)			Quark is a thief, a con man, nobody 			you want to know...           DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - 10/27/93 - TEASER           8.2A   CONTINUED:	(2)	Mora studies him, gives a scientific "hmmm"... if we had 	pipes in this universe, he'd puff on one... They sit at the 	Replimat.					MORA			So how is this police thing you got 			yourself into working out?					ODO			I enjoy my work as chief of security.					MORA				(casual, not realizing 				the pain this causes)			"Chief of security."  At a weigh 			station in space.	As a shape-shifter, Odo probably shrinks a little at hearing 	this... Mora smiles at him...					MORA			Don't you miss it, Odo?					ODO			What.					MORA			Our work.					ODO			Never.					MORA			I don't believe it.  I know you too 			well.  You were unhappy in the lab.  			I couldn't blame you for that.  But 			the work, Odo.  The exploration of 			you.  What you are.  Where you came 			from.  That's never far from your 			mind, is it.  Tell me the truth.					ODO			That part of it... is true.					MORA			Good.  Because I came here counting 			on that.	Off Odo's curious expression...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE: "The Alternate" - REV. 10/28/93 - ACT ONE        9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)3    INT.
