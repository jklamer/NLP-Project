JUNGLE - DAY	HUDSON has brought SISKO to a secluded area where the Maquis 	have made a temporary camp.  In the background, we see KIRA 	and BASHIR, surrounded by a handful of armed Maquis.	Though Hudson continues to keep his phaser trained on Sisko, 	both men, at least initially, try their best to keep the 	mood light and unthreatening.  After all, they've been close 	for a long time and neither is anxious to see their friendship 	end.  Still, the tension between them is never far from the 	surface.	Hudson is especially uncomfortable.  He knows that he's 	betrayed Sisko, and he also has mixed feelings about turning 	his back on Starfleet.  This is not a man who has an easy 	time justifying the use of violence.					HUDSON				(amused)			Ben, you should've seen the look on 			your face when you saw me standing 			there.					SISKO			I hardly recognized you without your 			uniform.	Hudson reaches down into a satchel and takes out his folded 	Starfleet uniform, which he offers to Sisko.					HUDSON				(re: the uniform)			Lately, it's been feeling a little 			tight on me.	Sisko looks at the uniform and then reluctantly accepts it.					SISKO			Just like that?          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - TEASER           2.1    CONTINUED:	There's a long beat as Hudson waits for a response, but 	Sisko just stares down at the clothing in his hand.					HUDSON				(trying to convince 				himself as well)			It's just a uniform, Ben.					SISKO			Is that all it is?				(a beat)			I remember when you first put it on.					HUDSON			The day we graduated from the Academy.  			We both swore we'd be starship 			captains by the time we were thirty.					SISKO				(smiles)			And admirals by forty.				(with feeling)			I think we've both done pretty well 			for ourselves.					HUDSON			We did, didn't we.  But now... now 			I've found something better.				(re: his Maquis 				comrades)			These settlers, Ben, if you saw all 			they've accomplished without any 			help from the Federation... you'd be 			fighting along with them.					SISKO			I don't think so.					HUDSON				(insistent)			They've traveled out here to the 			back of the beyond and built homes 			out of the wilderness.  Maybe the 			Federation can turn their backs on 			them, but I can't.          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - TEASER           3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			I'm not asking you to.  But your 			joining the Maquis isn't helping 			anyone.  Your actions have only 			endangered the treaty, put millions 			of lives at risk...					HUDSON				(interrupting)			The Federation believes every problem 			can be solved with a treaty.  But 			out here, on the frontier, without 			the power of the Federation to back 			it up, a treaty's just a piece of 			paper.					SISKO			Do you have evidence that the Central 			Command has violated the treaty?					HUDSON			Not yet, but we will.					SISKO			If you're depending on Gul Dukat for 			proof, you're going to be 			disappointed.					HUDSON			Why do you say that?					SISKO			Because I don't think he knows.					HUDSON			We'll find out, won't we.					SISKO			I want him back, Cal.					HUDSON			He's not here.					SISKO			Then where is he?	A long beat of tension, then...          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - TEASER           4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					HUDSON			I never thought I'd see the day where 			you'd side with a Cardassian against 			me.					SISKO			Damn it, Cal.  I'm on your side.					HUDSON			You have a funny way of showing it.					SISKO			I'm trying to stop you from making 			the biggest mistake of your life.  			The Federation believes in this 			treaty.  If you destroy it, 			Starfleet'll come after you, and 			they won't be satisfied until you're 			behind bars.  But if we put a stop 			to this now... if we work together 			to end the violence...					HUDSON				(angry)			The violence will never end as long 			as the Central Command keeps smuggling 			weapons to their colonies.				(a beat, regaining 				his poise)			I wish there was another way to handle 			this thing.  I really do.  No one 			wants peace more than the Maquis...	Hudson doesn't see the irony in this, but Sisko does.					SISKO			And you're willing to blow up 			Cardassian ships to get it.          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - TEASER           5.1    CONTINUED:	(4)					HUDSON				(simply)			The Bok'Nor won't ever smuggle weapons 			again.					SISKO			And its crewmembers won't be going 			home to their families, either.	Hudson's silence tells Sisko he's made his point.					SISKO				(continuing, pressing 				his advantage)			Look, you say that the Central Command 			is behind the smuggling.  Fine.  			Let's prove it.					HUDSON			How?					SISKO			We'll go to Cardassia... find the 			evidence to back up your claim.  And 			when we do, we'll take it to the 			Federation...					HUDSON				(interrupting)			No.  The Federation abandoned us.  			Told us to take care of ourselves.  			Well, that's what we intend to do.  			But you, Ben, you could be invaluable.				(off Sisko's look)			Let us use your station.					SISKO			For what?					HUDSON			Any number of things.  A maintenance 			facility for our ships... a supply 			depot...          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - TEASER           6.1    CONTINUED:	(5)					SISKO				(interrupting)			I can't allow that.					HUDSON			Every week, innocent people are being 			murdered by the Cardassians... and I 			won't allow their deaths to go 			unpunished.	A beat.  Stalemate.  Sisko understands how far over the line 	his friend has crossed.					SISKO			You don't want peace, Cal.  You want 			revenge.	Hudson knows he's lost Sisko.  He tries to hide his regret 	with a casual bravado.					HUDSON			I prefer to call it retaliation.				(a beat)			I'm sorry we won't be working 			together, Benjamin.  It would've 			been nice... like old times.	Hudson gestures for Sisko to join Kira and Bashir.2    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As Sisko walks towards his officers, Hudson stays back and 	points his phaser at Benjamin.  Kira sees this and shouts a 	warning.					KIRA			Commander!	Two of the Maquis shoot Kira and Bashir.  Sisko whirls back 	toward Hudson.					HUDSON			Sorry, Ben.	Hudson shoots Sisko, who collapses to the ground.3    ANGLE ON HUDSON	As he looks down at Sisko's unconscious body.          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - TEASER           7.3    CONTINUED:					HUDSON			Let's go.  Knowing Ben's temper, we 			don't want to be here when he wakes 			up.	And as Hudson and the Maquis EXIT...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE          8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR	DAX is waiting as the airlock door slides open and Sisko, 	Kira, and Bashir emerge.  Dax falls into step beside them as 	they walk down the corridor.  Sisko is instantly in action, 	giving orders, working with a full head of steam.					SISKO			Lieutenant, I want to speak to the 			Cardassian Central Command.					DAX			Then you're in luck.  Legate Parn 			will be arriving here within the 			hour.	Sisko and Dax exchange a look, acknowledging that things are 	heating up.					SISKO			A Legate.  I feel honored.  While 			I'm waiting, I'll talk with Starfleet.					DAX			Admiral Necheyev's already here.	This gets another look from Sisko.5    INT. OPS	O'BRIEN at his station.  Sisko, Dax and Kira ENTER from the 	Turbolift.  Sisko heads for his office while calling to 	O'Brien.					SISKO			Chief, The Maquis must have 			transferred Dukat off their ship 			before reaching that asteroid.  I 			want to know where they've hid him.					O'BRIEN			I could retrace their warp trail.  			See if they met up with any other 			ships.          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE          9.5    CONTINUED:					SISKO			Do it.	Sisko continues into his office...6    INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE	Sisko ENTERS to find a forboding Admiral NECHEYEV waiting 	for him.					SISKO				(a greeting)			Admiral...					NECHEYEV				(no time for 				pleasantries)			Commander, the Cardassian Central 			Command has gone on military alert 			in response to the kidnapping of Gul 			Dukat.7    NEW ANGLE	Sisko refuses to allow the Admiral's brusque manner to rattle 	him.					SISKO			I'm not surprised.					NECHEYEV			This Security Chief of yours... the 			shape-shifter.	Sisko pretends to a calm he's not really feeling in order to 	protect his Chief of Security.					SISKO			Odo.					NECHEYEV				(whatever)			Odo.  Are you sure you wouldn't be 			better off with a Starfleet officer 			heading up your security team.					SISKO			Admiral, I have complete faith in 			Odo's ability to do his job.          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE         10.7    CONTINUED:	The Admiral does not look convinced, but decides not to 	press it.					NECHEYEV			If you say so, Commander.					SISKO			I do.  As for Gul Dukat, I assure 			you that we're taking all possible 			steps to locate him.					NECHEYEV			Good.  Keep me informed of your 			progress.					SISKO			I will.  But Admiral, there's a bigger 			issue here than rescuing Dukat.					NECHEYEV				(skeptical)			And what is that?					SISKO			The Maquis.	This is clearly not one of the Admiral's favorite subjects.					NECHEYEV			The Maquis... are a bunch of 			irresponsible hotheads.					SISKO			These "hotheads" are responsible for 			the bombing of the Bok'Nor.					NECHEYEV			I'm aware of that, Commander.  We 			never should've allowed those 			colonists to remain on the Cardassian 			side of the Demilitarized Zone.					SISKO			Well they're there, Admiral.  And 			they're not leaving.					NECHEYEV				(annoyed)			Don't they realize that they're 			jeopardizing our treaty with the 			Cardassians?          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE         11.7    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			The Maquis never signed any treaty.					NECHEYEV			What about Commander Hudson?  He's 			lived with these people.  What's his 			analysis of the situation?	A beat as Sisko has to decide whether to tell the truth about 	his friend.					SISKO			I'll... have to ask him.					NECHEYEV			You do that.				(a beat)			I want you to find the Maquis, 			Commander... talk to them... remind 			them that they're citizens of the 			Federation... that it's imperative 			that we preserve the treaty with the 			Cardassians.					SISKO			A treaty the Cardassians may not be 			honoring.					NECHEYEV			Are you questioning Federation policy, 			Commander?					SISKO			All I know is that the situation in 			the Demilitarized Zone is 			deteriorating rapidly.          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE         12.7    CONTINUED:	(3)					NECHEYEV			Personally, I think you're overstating 			the problem.  Establish a dialogue 			with the Maquis.  They're still 			Federation citizens.  I'm sure they'll 			listen to reason.  Good luck, 			Commander.	Necheyev EXITS.					SISKO				(to himself, 				incredulous)			Establish a dialogue?  What the hell 			does she think I've been trying to 			do?8    INCLUDE KIRA	As she ENTERS Sisko's office.					KIRA			Commander?					SISKO				(still fuming)			Just because a group of people belongs 			to the Federation doesn't mean they're 			saints.					KIRA			Excuse me?					SISKO				(to Kira)			You know what the trouble is?					KIRA				(not following)			No...					SISKO				(emphatic)			The trouble is Earth.					KIRA				(still confused)			Really?          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE         13.8    CONTINUED:					SISKO			On Earth there's no poverty, no crime, 			no war.  You look out the window of 			Starfleet headquarters and you see... 			paradise.  Well, it's easy to be a 			saint in paradise.  But the Maquis 			don't live in paradise.  Out there 			in the Demilitarized Zone, all the 			problems haven't been solved yet.  			Out there, there are no saints... 			just people.  Angry, scared, 			determined people who are going to 			do whatever it takes to survive.  			Whether it meets with Federation 			approval or not.					KIRA			Makes sense to me.	A beat as Sisko regains his composure.  He smiles at Kira.					SISKO				(slight chagrin)			I'm glad someone understands.					KIRA			Legate Parn's ship just put in at 			Docking Bay Five.  Maybe you'd like 			to give him the same speech.					SISKO			I just might do that.					ODO'S COM VOICE			Odo to Sisko.					SISKO				(to comm)			Go ahead, Constable.					ODO'S COM VOICE			I think you'd better get down to 			security.  I've caught one of the 			Vulcan's accomplices.9    INT.

Odo harumphs.					ODO			Really.  Then perhaps you can explain 			why the two of you were spending so 			much time together.					QUARK			Surely it's no crime keeping company 			with a beautiful female.  You ought 			to try it, Odo.  It might improve 			your disposition.					ODO			Do you expect us to believe that a 			Vulcan would be interested in you 			for your lobes.					QUARK			Vulcans are a species that appreciate 			good ears.				(to Sisko)			Commander, this is very embarrassing, 			having to discuss my personal life 			in such surroundings.					SISKO			Embarrassment is going to be the 			least of your problems unless you 			tell me what kind of business 			arrangement you had with that woman.	Quark looks for a way out, but sees none and decides to make 	the best of it.					QUARK			All right.  But first I want to make 			it clear that I was led astray by 			Sakonna's feminine wiles.          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE         15.10   CONTINUED:					ODO			Save the excuses, Quark.

You sold weapons to a 			terrorist group.					QUARK				(feathers ruffled)			I did not.  The Pygorians sold them 			the weapons.  I merely... made some 			introductions.  Besides, I hadn't 			even heard of the Maquis until after 			Dukat was kidnapped.					SISKO			I want a complete list of every weapon 			she purchased.          DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, II" - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE         16.10   CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK			Of course.  And if you need some one 			to testify against Sakonna in court, 			I'd be more than willing...					ODO				(interrupting)			Would you?					QUARK			In a second.				(to Sisko)			And let me know if there's anyone 			else who needs testifying against.	Odo harumphs.					QUARK			I'll tell you one thing, Commander, 			Sakonna was on a tight clock.  			Whatever she needed those weapons 			for, it's going to happen within the 			next few days.					SISKO			Just get me the list, Quark.	Sisko turns to go.					ODO			Sir?	Sisko turns back.					ODO				(continuing)			I assume you'll be going out to search 			for Dukat again?					SISKO			As soon as O'Brien tells us where to 			look.					ODO			I'd like to join you.
