PROMENADE	SISKO discreetly observes the busy Promenade from an 	out-of-the-way corner, drinking in the sights and 	sounds of this place where he belongs. The station is 	vibrant, alive, happy. There's a much larger percentage 	of Starfleet and Klingon uniforms visible than before 	the war, but the mood is buoyant. The Promenade is now 	draped with Federation, Klingon and Bajoran banners 	which will be a fixture from now on and a sign of 	newfound patriotic sentiment on the station.					SISKO (V.O.) 			Captain's Personal Log: Stardate 			51247.5. It's been a week since 			our return to Deep Space Nine, but 			the mood of celebration continues. 			We're still at war and the 			station's been designated 			Headquarters for the Ninth Fleet. 			That, plus our strategic position 			guarding the wormhole, makes D.S. 			Nine one of the most tempting 			targets in the entire quadrant.	Sisko heads for a Turbolift, but before he gets very 	far, he's spotted by some Bajorans in the crowd who ask 	to shake his hand.     DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited... " - REV. 9/23/97 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:	Other Bajorans begin to gather round and then yet 	others -- Bajorans, Klingons, Humans, everyone -- stop 	and surround Sisko, some wanting to shake his hand, 	others pat him on the back, and some start to APPLAUD 	and CHEER. It's a mob scene, but one so filled with 	joy and celebration that Sisko can't help but smile 	back and let the sentiment wash over him as he tries 	to make it to the Turbolift.					SISKO (V.O.)				(continuing) 			But for now at least, the war 			seems very far away.	OFF the image of Sisko in a sea of happiness...									CUT TO:3    INT. OPS	Sisko ENTERS in a good mood. The room is now filled 	with Starfleet and Bajoran N.D.s for the first time in 	a long time. KIRA is at the Ops table, working.					SISKO			Good morning, major.					KIRA			Good morning, captain.					SISKO 			You don't know how much I missed 			hearing you say that.					KIRA			You don't know how much I hated 			saying, "Good morning, Dukat."					SISKO			I can imagine. What's on the 			agenda?					KIRA				(hands him a PADD) 			USS Potemkin has completed her 			repairs and she'll rejoin the 			fleet later today. Exeter, 			Sutherland and Akagi have 			submitted resupply requests. 			And there're about a thousand 			messages from Starfleet Command 			awaiting your "eyes-only" 			attention.     DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited... " - REV. 9/23/97 - TEASER     3.3    CONTINUED:					SISKO			Anything else?					KIRA			General Martok's waiting for you			in your office.					SISKO				(hands back the PADD)			I'll start with the general.					KIRA			Thought you might.	Sisko heads for his office, then pauses to look around 	Ops for a beat. He just can't help but smile one more 	time.					SISKO			Have I mentioned it's good to be			home?					KIRA			Once or twice.	Sisko EXITS to...4    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS	Sisko ENTERS to find GENERAL MARTOK sitting on the 	couch glaring at him.					MARTOK			You knew about this, didn't you?					SISKO			I had a pretty good idea.					MARTOK			And you did nothing to stop it?					SISKO			No. In fact... I recommended you			for the position.	Martok sags back on the couch for a moment, his worst 	fears confirmed. Sisko doesn't seem too worried -- in 	fact, he can barely keep a smile off his face.     DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited... " - REV. 9/23/97 - TEASER     4.4    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			Allow me to offer my 			congratulations to the new Supreme 			Commander of the Ninth Fleet.	He holds out a hand and Martok gets up and takes 	Sisko's proffered hand.					MARTOK 			Do you have any idea how much 			paperwork a supreme commander has 			to do?					SISKO			You're welcome. Would you like 			me to arrange quarters for you 			here on the station?					MARTOK 			No. I'll keep my flag aboard the 			Rotarran. It may be cramped, but 			at least I'll feel like I'm still 			in the war. By the way, I'd like 			Worf to continue functioning as 			my principal intelligence officer.					SISKO			I see no problem with that. He's 			the only officer I know who can 			never get enough work.					MARTOK 			At least when he's busy, he stops 			going on about this wedding of his.      DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited... " - REV. 9/23/97 - TEASER     5.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					MARTOK (Cont'd) 			There were times he nearly drove 			me mad aboard the Rotarran. Until 			his son arrived, it was all he 			could talk about. Then Alexander 			became all he could talk about. 			The man is nothing if not 			singleminded.					SISKO			I haven't met Worf's son yet. 			What's he like?					MARTOK 			He's a fine boy. Eager. 			Dedicated. And he has the heart 			of his father but... he's not the 			best soldier I've ever seen.									CUT TO:     DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited...

Alexander is regaling Dax 	with his stories of woe from the Rotarran, while Worf 	listens tolerantly. They've almost finished their 	drinks.					ALEXANDER			... but when he ordered me to 			bring the system back on-line I 			thought he was still talking about 			the hydro-static system so...					DAX			You didn't engage the pumps while 			the check valves were open?					WORF			He did.					ALEXANDER 			I flooded the entire deck with 			superheated hydraulic fluid.	Dax laughs and Alexander is clearly comfortable by now 	at making jokes at his own expense. Even Worf has a 	slight grin on his face.					ALEXANDER 			It took me three days to clean it 			up, but I swear it still smells 			like burnt dog hair in there.					DAX			Remind me to keep you away from 			the Defiant. You're a menace.					ALEXANDER 			The Rotarran's crew actually 			thinks of me as a good luck charm. 			The more mistakes I make, the 			safer they feel. I hope the 			Ya'Vang's crew feels the same way.					WORF			The Ya'Vang?					ALEXANDER 			I got new orders this morning. 			The battle cruiser Ya'Vang took 			heavy losses in their last 			engagement.     DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited... " - REV. 9/23/97 - TEASER    6A.5    CONTINUED:					ALEXANDER (Cont'd) 			So most of the Rotarran's crew is 			being transferred there at the end 			of the week. Including me.	This introduces a more somber note into the proceedings 	and there's a quiet beat before Alexander notices their 	empty mugs.     DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited... " - REV. 9/23/97 - TEASER     7.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					ALEXANDER 			More bloodwine?					DAX			Why not?	Worf shakes his head no, and then Alexander grabs Dax's 	mug and heads for the crowded bar. Dax and Worf watch 	him go with a note of sadness in the air.	QUARK stops by the table and follows their gaze.					QUARK 			Handsome young man. He must get 			his looks from his mother's side.					WORF			What do you want?					QUARK 			Have you had a chance to 			reconsider my offer?					WORF			We are not getting married in 			this... bar. The ceremony will 			be held on the Klingon homeworld 			after the war.	Dax suddenly makes a decision.     DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited...

This			week, before Alexander leaves.					QUARK			Perfect!				(begins to leave)			I'll handle all the arrangements.					WORF				(to Quark)			Wait.				(to Dax)			I thought we had agreed.     DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited...

It would mean so much 			to him and besides...				(hard to say it)			... it may be a long time before 			you see him again.	That makes Worf stop and think. He looks over at 	Alexander, who's returning with the mugs and sees 	everyone looking at him.					ALEXANDER 			What's going on?	Dax and Quark turn to Worf, who looks into the face of 	his son and finally makes his decision.					WORF 			Our wedding plans have changed. 			We're getting married here. On 			Deep Space Nine. And I want you 			to be my Tawi'Yan.	Alexander gives him a blank look.					DAX 			"Sword-bearer" -- sort of like a 			best man.					ALEXANDER 			Me? Really? That's great!	In his excitement, Alexander throws up an arm in joy, 	and in so doing, he KNOCKS over a tray being carried 	by a Waiter, which in turn CRASHES onto a table of 	customers.					QUARK 				(to Worf) 			I'll put that on your tab.	OFF Alexander's chagrined face...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited...

He's got everything 			figured out, right down to the 			color of my shoes.					KIRA			No offense, Jadzia, but it seems 			like this wedding is all about 			what Worf wants.				(to com) 			Habitat Ring, Section Fifty-one 			Gamma.				(to Dax) 			What about you?	The lift starts MOVING.					DAX 			A traditional Klingon wedding with 			all the trimmings is something 			Worf's been thinking about since 			he was a boy. It probably has 			something to do with being raised 			by human parents. In any case, 			when it comes to Klingon 			tradition, Worf is very 			sentimental.					KIRA			Worf?					DAX 			All men are sentimental. They 			just cover it up with scowls and 			clenched jaws. There're times 			when Worf literally gets misty-			eyed talking about Klingon rituals.    DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited...

But the truth is, I've 			gone through five Trill 			ceremonies -- three as a bride, 			two as a groom -- and I'm a little 			bored with it.				(re: Odo) 			Is it my imagination, or did Odo 			just avoid us?					KIRA			I didn't notice.	Dax gives her a "Oh, come on," look and Kira cops to it.					KIRA 			We've been... avoiding each other 			ever since the Dominion left the 			station. I think we're both 			afraid of talking about what 			happened during the occupation.					DAX 			What do you mean?					KIRA				(awkward) 			To tell you the truth, it's 			nothing I want to talk about right 			now, either.	They round a corner and stop short at the sight of...7    BASHIR	who's filling the Corridor outside his quarters with 	JUNK from around the galaxy.    DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited...

Sirella is the mistress of a Klingon House -- 	a coveted and highly respected position in their 	society -- and she acts like it. She's about Martok's 	age, but there's an elegance and beauty to Sirella that 	contrasts with the grizzled veteran's soldierly 	persona.
