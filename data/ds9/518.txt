PROMENADE - OUTSIDE QUARK'S BAR	A somber QUARK paces the Promenade across from the bar 	doors. The bar is closed, the windows are shuttered -- 	but through the glass doors, we see occasional FLASHES 	of intense bright red lights accompanied by excited 	SHOUTS from inside.					VOICES			"Look out -- behind you." "I see			him."  "Under the Dabo table!"			"There's one on the railings." "I			got him."	The activity only increases Quark's depression. He 	stops pacing and stares forlornly at the bar.					DAX (O.S.)			Who's winning the war?	ANGLE ADJUSTS to include DAX, stepping up to Quark.					QUARK			Too early to tell.					DAX			It's been three days.					QUARK			Don't remind me.				(a beat)			They found a nest.					DAX			That's good.					QUARK			It wasn't the main nest.					DAX			That's not so good. I thought			Chief O'Brien trapped the last			vole on the station months ago.					QUARK			Well, obviously he missed a			couple. A married couple.

QUARK'S QUARTERS	Quark is seated on the couch, in a deep funk. The.door 	CHIMES. Quark doesn't seem to hear it. The door 	CHIMES again.					QUARK 			Come in.	The door OPENS to reveal a very happy and energetic 	ROM.					ROM 			Hello, Brother.	Quark doesn't want to see anybody.					QUARK 				(listless) 			What do you want?					ROM 			You have every right to be 			depressed, Brother. Ever since 			you were blacklisted by the 			Ferengi Commerce Authority it's 			been one thing after another.

He steps 	outside and excitedly beckons to someone off screen:					ROM			Come on in.	And to Quark's surprise, LEETA ENTERS, looking every 	bit as happy and bubbly as Rom.					QUARK			What's she doing here?	Rom puts his arm around Leeta, they smile.					ROM				(an announcement)			We're getting married.	Quark sits back on the couch, flings his head back on 	the headrest.					QUARK			I wish I was dead.					ROM				(to Leeta)			He's been a little depressed			lately.					QUARK			I don't want to live.					LEETA			I think you need someone to talk			to... someone to pamper you.	Quark certainly doesn't want to take advice from Leeta.					QUARK			I think I need to be alone.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ferengi Love...

Chief O'Brien.						ROM				(wrong) 			That's not a bad guess.					QUARK 			Rom -- just tell me who it is. 			That way, you can leave and I can 			go back to my brooding.					ROM				(that seems reasonable) 			There's only one person in my life 			who's always there for me... who's 			never too busy to listen... who 			reassures me when I'm scared... 			comforts me when I'm sad... and 			who showers me with endless love, 			without ever asking anything in 			return.						LEETA				(impressed) 			I'd like to meet this person...					QUARK 			So would I.					ROM				(putting his hand on 				Quark's shoulder) 			You already know her.

The 	doorbell is CHIMING as Quark's mother, ISHKA, 	looking slightly worried, goes to the door.	She taps a panel and the door OPENS, revealing a wet 	and needy Quark.					QUARK			Mother?					ISHKA 			Quark?					QUARK 			Moogie!	Quark envelops his mother in a tight bear hug.					QUARK			Hold me.	And as he clings to Moogie, who looks a little less 	than delighted with this sudden turn of events, we:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ferengi Love...

I 			mean, learning to be a Ferengi 			woman? Memorizing the Rules of 			Acquisition...					DAX			Not likely. Leeta's not the type 			of woman to quit her job, stop 			wearing clothes, and never go out 			in public.					ROM 			That's okay. I just want her to 			be happy. DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ferengi Love...

Quark has 	been pouring his soul out to her, and as he nears the 	end of his story, Moogie seems sympathetic, yet a bit 	impatient for it to end.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ferengi Love...

I see 			all these great opportunities out 			there, but I can't do anything 			about them. Without a Ferengi 			Business License... it's like I 			don't exist.					ISHKA				(sympathetic) 			I understand why you felt the need 			to escape for awhile. But why 			come here?					QUARK			I had no place else to go.					ISHKA			You're sure about that?				(off Quark's look) 			Oh, don't give me that look -- you 			and I both know we've never really 			gotten along. You disapprove of 			me, Quark. You always have. 			"Moogie, stop wearing clothes."			"Moogie, stop earning profit."					QUARK				(double-checking) 			You have stopped, haven't you?

I'm exhausted.	Ishka gets up and blocks his path.					ISHKA				(with sudden alarm) 			What you need is some of your 			mother's cooking. Some nice, 			juicy tube grubs?					QUARK 			I never liked your tube grubs.					ISHKA				(trying to make it 				tempting) 			I'll pre-chew them for you.	But Quark can't be enticed; he moves around her, 	heading for the bedroom.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ferengi Love...

Zek's Hupyrian servant, 	MAIHAR'DU, protectively embraces Zek.	But the image doesn't register with Quark. He simply 	hands the bag to Zek who takes it. Quark then shuts 	the door and turns back toward the room. He takes 	three steps before he realizes what has just 	transpired.	Quark pivots and returns to the closet, opening the 	doors, hoping that he's just imagining things...	But his eyes haven't been playing tricks on him. The 	Grand Nagus Zek and Maihar'du are indeed crammed in his 	closet.					QUARK				(with awe)			Grand Nagus...	The Nagus flings Quark's bag back at him.					ZEK			Quark, what are you doing here?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Ferengi Love...
