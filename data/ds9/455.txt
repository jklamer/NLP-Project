We can tell by the look on Kira's face that this is 	the beginning of a very long and very bad day.					DAX			Kira, we've got six Byzatium 			transports coming in this afternoon.  			I've got to have more cargo space.  					KIRA				(weary)			All right... have them offload into 			Cargo Bays three and four, but that's 			it.  We're pushing our storage 			capacity as it is.					O'BRIEN			Oh, that reminds me... we got a 			message last night saying the 			Byzallians want to move up their 			conference by a week.	Kira picks up a PADD in frustration and exhaustion.					KIRA			I haven't had a chance to read through 			last night's reports... anything 			else I should know?	Dax and O'Brien exchange a glance.  Kira's not going to like 	this...					O'BRIEN			Well...					KIRA			What?					DAX			Starfleet wants a complete report 			done on our computer calibration 			subroutine.           DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - REV. 10/04/94 - TEASER            2.1    CONTINUED:					KIRA			The whole subroutine?				(they nod)			When?	Beat.					O'BRIEN			Tomorrow.	Kira reacts... she's starting to get a headache...									CUT TO:2    INT. SECURITY OFFICE	Kira's headache is getting worse as she listens to ODO.					ODO			Someone -- probably a certain 			bartender we know -- has been using 			a public terminal to falsify inventory 			records and cargo manifests on the 			last three Ferengi transport ships 			that were here.  In other words, we 			have no idea what they've been 			shipping in and out of this station 			for the past month.					KIRA				(tired)			That means we've got to open every 			single Ferengi container on the 			station.					ODO			We have another problem as well... 			the Tholian Ambassador reported that 			someone broke into his quarters during 			the night and stole three cases of 			latinum.					KIRA			Three cases?					ODO			It was the dowry for his wedding.					KIRA			When's the wedding?           DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - REV. 10/04/94 - TEASER            3.2    CONTINUED:					ODO			Tomorrow.	Kira puts a hand to her temple... it's getting worse.									CUT TO:3    INT. INFIRMARY	BASHIR is talking to Kira, who's just about at the end of 	her rope.					BASHIR			Major, the scheduled transport's 			been delayed and I need those medical 			supplies by the end of the week at 			the latest.					KIRA			We can't spare a runabout to go all 			the way to Vulcan right now.					BASHIR			I'm supposed to set up a field 			hospital for the new colony on Campor 			Three next week.  If I don't have 			those supplies, it could set the 			entire colonization schedule back by 			at least --	Kira finally boils over and cuts loose at Bashir.					KIRA				(explodes)			Listen to me.  You can't have a 			runabout, you can't get your medical 			supplies, and I don't give a damn 			about the colonization schedule.  			We've got problems of our own, so 			those colonists can make do with a 			box of bandages for all I care.	Kira turns and begins to storm out of the room, when Bashir 	stops her cold by the low and deadly serious tone in his 	voice.					BASHIR			Stop right there, Major.	Kira turns and looks at him, just waiting for him to start 	another argument, but Bashir handles the situation with a 	Doctor's clinical and dispassionate authority.           DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - REV. 10/05/94 - TEASER            4.3    CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(continuing)			When was your last day off?					KIRA			I don't know.  What does that have 			to do with--					BASHIR			If you can't remember, it's been too 			long.				(beat)			You're off duty as of this moment.					KIRA			What do you mean, I'm off duty?  You 			can't do that.					BASHIR			Oh, yes I can.  And not even Commander 			Sisko can overrule my judgement as 			chief medical officer.	Kira blinks at him a moment... tries to backtrack.					KIRA			Wait a minute, Julian... just because 			I snapped at you isn't enough to--					BASHIR			My diagnosis is that you're overworked 			and suffering from extreme stress 			and borderline exhaustion.  As for 			my prescription... come with me.	He heads for the door... Kira hesitates, then EXITS with 	him.									CUT TO:4    INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL	Kira is sitting at a table.  QUARK is putting things on the 	table in front of her, as Bashir looks on.           DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - REV. 10/05/94 - TEASER            5.4    CONTINUED:					QUARK				(placing the items)			Karvino juice... Lorvan crackers... 			a holosuite program... a jumja 			stick... and gambling tokens.					BASHIR			Now, at least two of these items 			must be used and fully enjoyed before 			you can leave this facility.					KIRA			Julian...					QUARK				(to Bashir)			I'll be giving you a full report on 			her activities, Doctor.					BASHIR				(to Kira)			If I hear you didn't relax and have 			a good time tonight, we'll do this 			every night until you do.				(smiles)			Have fun.	Bashir and Quark EXIT.  Kira sits there for a moment, unsure 	how to react, then smiles to herself at the outrageousness 	of it all.  She picks up the glass of juice and takes a sip.					RIKER'S VOICE			Looks like you've got your evening 			all planned out.	Kira turns and sees COMMANDER WILLIAM RIKER looking down at 	her.					RIKER			I hope you left room for... the 			unexpected.	He gives her his most winning smile as he sits down across 	from her.  And we can see that Kira is intrigued...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                       DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - 09/29/94 - ACT ONE              6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)5    INT.

And call me Wil.	Sisko gestures to a chair and they sit.					SISKO			What brings you to Deep Space Nine?					RIKER			Strictly pleasure.  I've built up 			about three months worth of leave 			and Doctor Crusher finally insisted 			that I take some of it.  In fact, 			she nearly shoved me out the airlock.					SISKO			D.S. Nine isn't exactly known as a 			vacation getaway.					RIKER			I'm actually just passing through on 			my way to Risa.  The last time I was 			here, I only got to spend two hours 			at Quark's... but by the time I left, 			I had all his latinum and a date 			with one of his dabo girls.  I thought 			I might try my luck again.					SISKO				(with humor)			Be careful... Quark's dabo wheel has 			been a little stingy recently.  And 			one of his Dabo girls is dating my 			son.           DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - REV. 10/04/94 - ACT ONE           7.5    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(with humor)			In that case, maybe I better spend 			my time in the holosuites.  It sounds 			safer... all the way around.	Sisko chuckles.					SISKO			Is there anything I can do for you 			while you're here?  A look around 			the station... maybe a tour of the 			Defiant?  Chief O'Brien's working on 			her polaron deflector this morning... 			I'm sure he'd love to show you around.					RIKER			Thanks... but to be honest, the last 			thing I want to do on my vacation is 			look at polaron deflectors.					SISKO				(smiles)			I can't say that I blame you.	Riker leans in with a grin on his face.					RIKER			Now... which Dabo girl is your son 			dating... just to be on the safe 			side?	Sisko sits back with a mixture of embarrassment and pride.									CUT TO:6    INT.

Dax comes over to her.					DAX			Who's in there?					KIRA				(surprised)			What?             DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - 09/29/94 - ACT ONE              8.6    CONTINUED:					DAX			Who's in with Benjamin?					KIRA				(a little embarrassed)			Oh... it's Wil -- Commander Wil Riker 			from the Enterprise.	Dax smiles at the name.					DAX			Wil Riker...					KIRA			You know him?					DAX			Met him at Quark's about a year ago.  			Quite a dabo player.				(beat)			Do you know him?					KIRA				(casual)			Yes... a little.

Suddenly, the doors to 	Sisko's office OPEN and Riker and Sisko ENTER Ops.					SISKO			If you can find the time, you have 			an open invitation for dinner with 			Jake and me.					RIKER			I just might take you up on that.	Dax moves to Riker and greets him warmly.					DAX				(joking)			I hope you're not here for another 			loan.	Riker gives her a blank look -- he has no idea what she's 	talking about.  Dax smiles at him.					DAX			Don't tell me you've forgotten who 			staked you three strips of latinum 			when your winning streak ran dry?	Riker recovers quickly, smiles in embarrassment, and shakes 	her hand.					RIKER			Oh, my God... of course.  Sorry... 			most of that night is still a blur.  			How are you, Dax?					DAX			Fine.	Riker's eye wanders to Kira, who has stayed at her console.					RIKER			Major.					KIRA			Commander.           DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - REV. 10/04/94 - ACT ONE          10.6    CONTINUED:	(3)	Sisko and Dax both notice the look between Riker and Kira 	and then exchange a look of their own.					RIKER				(to Sisko & Dax)			Well.

He takes a 	few steps backward behind the corner... waits... and then 	walks casually around the bend as if just coming out of the 	shop.  He nearly runs right into Kira, who is coming the 	opposite way down the Promenade.					RIKER			Oops.  Sorry about that.					KIRA			It's all right.					RIKER			My mind was a million light years 			away.  Should've been paying attention 			to where I was going.	Kira smiles at him... there's an awkward beat... then Kira 	glances at the shop Riker just came out of.					KIRA			So... doing some shopping?           DEEP SPACE: "Defiant" - REV. 10/04/94 - ACT ONE          11.8    CONTINUED:					RIKER			I'm just exploring the Promenade 			actually.

A 	computer terminal is nearby.  Kira and Riker approach.  Kira 	taps some commands into the computer terminal.					COMPUTER VOICE			Please identify for access to USS 			Defiant.	Kira puts her hand on a computer panel, which LIGHTS UP.					KIRA			Major Kira Nerys, Bajoran militia.					COMPUTER VOICE			Identity confirmed.	Riker steps up, puts his hand on the same panel.					RIKER			Commander William Riker, Starfleet.					COMPUTER VOICE			Identity confirmed.	The Guard then works his terminal for a moment.

Kira and Riker ENTER and see Chief O'Brien is lying 	under a console, with his head inside the open panel.  Kira 	is a little surprised, but the look on Riker's face says 	that he's not very happy about this particular surprise.					KIRA			Chief.

And they're 			worth a lot more to him than Maquis 			prisoners.					RIKER			I don't buy it.  The Cardassians 			aren't going to let us just walk 			away.					SISKO			You're right.

You'll 			never make it to Orias... you know 			that.  There may be five ships ahead 			of you now... but there might be 			fifty waiting there for all we know.	She moves closer to Riker, and pulls him aside... pressing 	her point to him in a personal way.					KIRA				(quiet, continuing)			Be a Starfleet officer one last time 			and think of your crew.  You may 			want Tom Riker to go out in a blaze 			of glory that they'll talk about for 			the next ten years... but don't drag 			them along with you.	Riker looks up at his crew, who are all looking at him.
