WARDROOM	Where SISKO, MARTOK, ADMIRAL ROSS and a ROMULAN	GENERAL are listening to O'BRIEN brief them about	the Breen situation. On the WALL MONITOR we see a	STARCHART displaying the current tactical picture.					O'BRIEN			-- basically we stumbled onto it			by accident. At Chin'toka, our			entire fleet was disabled when			the Breen engaged their energy-			dampening weapon. Three hundred			and eleven ships -- Federation,			Romulan, and Klingon -- all lost			power.					SISKO			But one didn't -- a Bird of Prey			called the Ki'tang.	Ross and the Romulan perk up at hearing this.	Martok -- having already been briefed on the subject	-- lets them ask the questions.					ROSS			Why, what was different about the			Ki'tang?					O'BRIEN			We're not exactly sure. The only			thing we can figure is that right			before the engagement, her Chief			Engineer adjusted the tritium			intermix to compensate for a			containment problem in the warp			core.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "When it Rains... " - REV. 03/02/99 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:					MARTOK			I've ordered every ship in the			Klingon fleet to adjust its			reactor the same way.					ROMULAN			Our vessels are of a different			design -- can this technique be			adapted to protect them as well?					SISKO			Unfortunately, no. Your ships			are still vulnerable.				(to Ross)			And so are ours.					O'BRIEN			I've sent what we know about the			Breen weapon to the Romulan			Ministry of Science and to			Starfleet Engineering, but			realistically, it's going to be a			while before they can come up			with a way to protect our ships.					SISKO			Thank you, Chief.	O'Brien nods and EXITS. A beat, then Ross turns to	the others.					ROSS			Well, Gentlemen, it would seem			that the Klingon fleet is the			only thing standing between us			and the Dominion.					ROMULAN				(under his breath)			What have we come to... ?	Martok shoots him a look					MARTOK			By tomorrow, we'll have eleven			hundred Klingon vessels ready for			deployment.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "When it Rains... " - REV. 03/02/99 - TEASER     3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					ROMULAN				(dismissive)			With the Breen, the Cardassians			and the Jem'Hadar you're still			outnumbered twenty-to-one.					MARTOK				(sharp)			I'm aware of that, general.	Sisko intercedes before the argument becomes more	heated.					SISKO			Obviously the Klingons can't go			head-to-head with the Dominion.			But they might be able to keep			them distracted.					MARTOK			We'll operate in small battle			groups -- moving in under cloak,			engaging the enemy, then trying			to provoke them into pursuit.					SISKO			With any luck, they'll be able to			keep the Dominion off balance and			prevent them from launching an			offensive.					ROMULAN			For how long? They can't keep			them at bay forever.					SISKO			No, they can't. But fortunately			we're not the only ones the			Dominion has to contend with			right now.					ROSS			Damar's resistance movement...					ROMULAN				(dismissive)			What's left of it. Half his			troops were killed in their			assault on Rondac.					SISKO			They may have failed to capture			Rondac, but the attack sent a			message to the Cardassian people.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "When it Rains... " - REV. 03/02/99 - TEASER     4.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO (Cont'd)			If the rebels can show them that			they have a chance of succeeding,			their support will grow.					ROMULAN			Does the rebellion have a chance			of succeeding?					SISKO			Yes, but they need to adjust			their tactics -- concentrate on			small-scale hit-and-run attacks,			sabotaging key facilities... 					ROSS			Damar's a by-the-book soldier.			Does he have any experience			waging that kind of campaign?					SISKO			No, he doesn't. That's why we			need to send him someone who			does...									CUT TO:3    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	where Sisko is talking to an incredulous KIRA.					KIRA			You want me to go behind enemy			lines and teach a bunch of			Cardassians how to be resistance			fighters?					SISKO			I'm aware of the irony. But the			tactics you used to drive the			Cardassians off Bajor are exactly			what this situation calls for.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "When it Rains... " - REV. 03/02/99 - TEASER     5.3    CONTINUED:					KIRA			But to work with Damar? He's a			murderer. When he killed Ziyal --			he murdered an innocent girl.					SISKO			You're going to have to put your			personal feelings aside. Whether			you like Damar or not is			irrelevant. We need him.				(laying it out for				her)			The Dominion knows it has to stop			his rebellion before it spreads.			It's your job to make sure they			don't. It's as simple as that.	Kira can't argue with him and she knows it.					KIRA			Yes, sir.				(beat)			I understand Damar and his men			went into hiding after the attack			on Rondac. Any idea how we can			locate them?					SISKO			I suggest you talk to Mister			Garak about that.					KIRA				(less than pleased)			Garak?					SISKO			He still has contacts on			Cardassia. In fact if I were			you, I'd ask him to join your			team. He could be useful.					KIRA			Damar, now Garak... should be an			interesting mission...	And off Kira as she grapples with what she's been	asked to do, we...4    OMITTED									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                            DEEP SPACE NINE: "When it Rains...

Needless	to say, the good constable is starting to lose	patience with him.					BASHIR			... it's very difficult to keep a			supply of synthetic organs on			hand in a battlefield situation.			You never know how many livers			you're going to need, how many			hearts --					ODO				(interrupting)			I can imagine. But what does			that have to do with me?					BASHIR			Well you see, the Holy Grail of			organ replacement is to come up			with a way to inject the patient			with undifferentiated tissue that			can become whatever organ is			needed. The problem is --					ODO			Doctor, get to the point.	Bashir holds up the beaker with a wan smile.					BASHIR			Can I borrow a cup of goo?					ODO			Excuse me?					BASHIR			I promise I'll give it back. DEEP SPACE NINE: "When it Rains...

As soon as he's gone,	Winn drops the pretense -- though there's a look of	guilt on her features. Dukat approaches...					DUKAT			Well done.				(smiling)			I almost believed you myself.	Winn gives him a cold look --					WINN			How like a Cardassian to find			amusement in an old man's death.			You don't know how much I regret			having to kill him.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "When it Rains...
