The time is oh-six-			hundred.	We see a shadowy figure move in the quarters and hear 	Sisko's groggy voice.					SISKO 			Acknowledged. 				(a beat) 			Lights.	The lights come up, revealing SISKO in his quarters, in 	bed with KASIDY YATES. Kasidy is much less awake. She 	looks very comfortable.					KASIDY 			Do you always get up at oh-six-			hundred?					SISKO			I like to get an early start. But 			you can sleep in if you want.					KASIDY			Sleep in? I usually get up at 			five.				(smiles) 			When you're a freighter captain, 			you don't have the luxury of lying 			around in bed all day.	Sisko doesn't believe her.					SISKO 			If you usually get up that early, 			why do you look so sleepy?					KASIDY 			I don't usually stay up until one 			A.M.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Indiscretion" - REV. 09/06/95 - TEASER       2.1    CONTINUED:					SISKO				(smiles)			Sorry about that.	He kisses her.					KASIDY				(returns kiss) 			I'm not.					SISKO			I'd better get going.

Still, she knows she'd better 	take it.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Indiscretion" - REV. 08/21/95 - TEASER       5.6    CONTINUED:					KIRA				(to com) 			Put him through.7    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as Kira activates her monitor, which displays a lean and 	weathered looking Bajoran. This is RAZKA. He's 	wearing a Klingon disruptor, a Romulan belt, and other 	bits of mismatched equipment. In other words, he looks 	like what he is... a scavenger.					KIRA			Razka. It's been a while. How's 			business?					RAZKA				(on monitor) 			Let's just say I miss the old days 			on Bajor. Smuggling may not've 			been the safest line of work, but 			it was a lot more exciting than 			selling scrap metal.					KIRA			I think you're the only Bajoran I 			know who actually misses the 			occupation.					RAZKA				(on monitor) 			Don't get me wrong. I'm glad the 			Cardassians are gone.				(smiles) 			I just wish I'd put away a little 			more latinum before they left.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Indiscretion" - REV. 08/21/95 - TEASER       6.7    CONTINUED:					KIRA				(smiles back) 			I'm sure you did your best.				(a beat) 			What's on your mind, Razka?					RAZKA				(on monitor, simply) 			I've picked up a lead on the 			Ravinok.	Though the mention of the Ravinok obviously strikes a 	cord, Kira tries to remain skeptical.					KIRA			Like the last time?					RAZKA				(on monitor) 			Last time it was just a rumor. 			This time I have evidence. A 			fragment of metal. It looks like 			part of the forward sensor array.	Kira lets herself feel a spark of hope.					KIRA			Can you bring it to Deep Space 			Nine for analysis?					RAZKA				(on monitor) 			Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't 			leave the Badlands right now...				(an explanation) 			Important business. You 			understand.					KIRA			The Tholians after you again?					RAZKA				(on monitor) 			Let's just say it'd be better if 			you came to me.					KIRA				(not sure she wants to 				do this) 			It's been six years.

Where have I heard 			that name?					ODO 			We arrested him once for 			attempting to break into the assay 			office.					KIRA			And now he's taken up 			pickpocketing?					ODO 			Without much success. 				(joking) 			Though I suppose you have to 			admire his persistence.	Odo expects at least a smile from Kira, but she doesn't 	react at all.					ODO 			That was a joke.	She shakes her head. She knows she wasn't really 	paying attention.					KIRA 			I'm sorry, Odo. it's just...

The odds are 			that everyone aboard is dead.					ODO			That all may be true, but it's not 			what I was going to say.				(off her reaction) 			I was going to say... good luck.					KIRA			Good luck?					ODO			You had a friend on board, 			correct?	Kira looks a little sad. This is an old wound.					KIRA			Lorit Akrem.					ODO			Which means it doesn't matter 			whether I think there are any 			survivors, or even whether you 			think there are any survivors. 			You're going to go looking for 			that ship.				(a beat) 			So all I can say is... good luck. 			I hope you find them.	Kira nods.

Here to see me off?	Sisko wishes that were the case, but it's not.					SISKO 			I'm afraid not.				(a beat) 			I'd like you to postpone your 			trip. At least for a day or two.					KIRA 			What's wrong?					SISKO			Somehow the Cardassian government 			got wind of your plan to search 			for the Ravinok. They've asked 			permission to send someone with 			you.					KIRA			And you said yes?	Sisko may be sympathetic to what Kira's feeling, but he 	still has to look at the bigger picture.					SISKO 			I said I'd talk to you about it.				(a beat) 			The Ravinok was a 			Cardassian ship.					KIRA			Carrying Bajoran prisoners.				(a beat) 			I'm not stopping anyone from 			looking.

If their 			representative isn't here in fifty-			two hours, I'm going alone.	Sisko knows Kira's only agreeing to this for his sake, 	and he appreciates it.					SISKO				(smiles) 			I'll be sure they get the message.	Sisko EXITS, leaving Kira alone with her thoughts.11   OMITTED      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Indiscretion" - REV. 08/23/95 - ACT ONE     12.12   INT.

This is the first he's heard of it.					SISKO 			You're going to work for the 			Bajorans?					KASIDY			If we can hammer out an agreement. 			It's a terrific opportunity. I 			get to use my own ship, pick my 			own crew, and the best part is, I 			never have to leave this sector.					DAX			Where're you going to live?					KASIDY 			On my ship, I suppose.					DAX			Why don't you stay here?

Sisko watches her go.					DAX			That answers that.				(off Sisko's reaction) 			She's serious.	Sisko nods. But there's something in Sisko's face that 	tells us he's not as happy about the news as he thought 	he might be. This is all a little sudden for him.14   INT.

Kira 	notices it and isn't about to let it slide.					KIRA			Dukat, let's get one thing 			straight. This is my mission. 			The only reason you're here is 			because I agreed to let you come 			along.

So you're on this mission 			for personal reasons.					KIRA			Something wrong with that?					DUKAT 			Not at all.

You're the embodiment 			of the new Bajor. A Bajoran born 			out of the ashes of the 			occupation, a Bajoran tempered 			with Cardassian steel.					KIRA			Captain Sisko's right.

The massacres or the 			strip mining?	Dukat smiles. He refuses to be drawn into an argument.					DUKAT 			I have no wish to debate the 			merits of the Occupation. I'm 			even willing to admit that perhaps 			we were a little too harsh in our 			methods. But the fact is, the 			Bajoran people are stronger than 			they have been in centuries. When 			we arrived, you were a weak, 			contemplative race, choking on 			your isolation. And now you have 			a new confidence, a renewed sense 			of purpose, not to mention a key 			role in the future of this entire 			quadrant.					KIRA			All of which Bajor achieved in 			spite of the Cardassians, not 			because of them.					DUKAT 			Think what you must.

DOZARIA DESERT (LOCATION) - DAY	Dukat and Kira march through the barren desert. Dukat 	is no longer in front. They're walking side-by-side, 	and Kira keeps glancing over at Dukat.					KIRA			You know I'm not going to let you 			do it.	Dukat just keeps walking.					KIRA			I mean it, Dukat. You're not 			going to kill that girl.					DUKAT 			Major, you worry about the other 			survivors, and let me worry about 			Ziyal. After all, she's my 			daughter.					KIRA			That's right, she is your 			daughter. And there's nothing 			more important to Cardassians than 			family. At least that's what your 			people are always saying.					DUKAT 			I have a wife and seven children. 			They're my family. And they're 			the ones I have to protect.					KIRA			You should've thought of that 			before you got involved with 			Naprem.    DEEP- I SPACE NINE: "Indiscretion" - REV. 08/23/95 - ACT FOUR  44A.54   CONTINUED:					DUKAT 			You're right. I should have. But 			I made a mistake. A mistake I 			intend to correct.					KIRA			You don't have to bring her back 			to Cardassia with you. Let me 			take her to Bajor. No one has to 			know you're her father.	Dukat stops walking.					DUKAT 			And what kind of life would that 			be for her? Your people have 			never exactly welcomed half-			Cardassian children into your 			society.				(a beat) 			That's why I sent her and her 			mother away in the first place. 			I knew the Occupation was ending, 			and that there'd be no place for 			them on Bajor... or Cardassia.					KIRA			So you sent them to a prison camp.					DUKAT				(angry) 			They weren't headed for a prison 			camp. The Ravinok was supposed to  			rendezvous with a freighter which  			was to take Naprem and Ziyal to  			Lissepia, where they could live  			out their lives in peace.					KIRA			I don't understand. If you cared  			enough to help Ziyal then, how  			could you be thinking about  			killing her now? Why not send her  			away again?					DUKAT  			Because times have changed. My  			position isn't nearly as stable as  			it once was. By aligning myself  			with the new civilian government,  			I've made many enemies, enemies  			who wouldn't hesitate to use Ziyal  			against me.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Indiscretion" - REV. 08/21/95 - ACT FOUR     45.54   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA  			Listen to yourself. It's not your  			wife or your seven children you're  			trying to protect. It's you.					DUKAT  			By protecting myself, I protect  			them.	Which ends the conversation as far as Dukat is 	concerned. He begins walking again.					KIRA			And the only one who'll suffer is  			Ziyal. You'd kill your own  			daughter to save your career.	Dukat doesn't answer.					KIRA			I don't understand you, Dukat. I  			saw you crying over Naprem's  			grave. You said you loved her.					DUKAT  			I did love her. And when I bury  			Ziyal, I'll weep over her grave  			just as I wept over her mother's.  			But that won't stop me from doing  			what needs to be done. 				(with an edge)  			And when the time comes, I suggest  			you stay out of my way.	Dukat picks up the pace, walking away into the desert. 	Kira follows him, more determined than ever.55   INT.

But I don't think this is  			one of those times.				(a beat)  			It's pretty simple, Dad.				(simply)  			You're scared.					SISKO			What do I have to be afraid of?					JAKE  			A lot. Kasidy's willing to make  			a major change in her life just to  			be close to you. If things don't  			work out, you're going to feel  			responsible. And that's scary.	Sisko can't argue with him.					SISKO  			You figured all this out by  			yourself?					JAKE  			Actually, I talked with Nog about  			it.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Indiscretion" - 08/18/95 - ACT FOUR       47.55   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO  			You talked to Nog about my  			relationship with Kasidy?					JAKE  			And we think you have nothing to  			worry about.
