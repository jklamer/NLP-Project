O'Brien, Worf, Ezri 	and Bashir are gathered around the Captain's Chair, 	standing at attention.	The Bridge layout is familiar, but the CAPTAIN'S 	CHAIR is different, and there's a FREE-STANDING 	CONSOLE where the aft table used to be.	We should try to convey a sense of a brand-spanking 	new ship (budget permitting), with shining consoles, 	new carpeting, slick new VPB wallpaper, etc.					ROSS 			To Captain Benjamin L. Sisko. As 			of this date, you are requested 			and required to take command of 			U.S.S. Sao Paulo.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Dogs...

You've 			got a fine ship here.					SISKO			She has some pretty big shoes to 			fill.	The crew breaks up, eager to examine their new ship.					BASHIR				(to O'Brien) 			I hate the carpet.				(off his look) 			I do.	O'Brien goes to a console and begins checking over 	the readings and Worf looks over his shoulder. Ross 	heads for the door, then pauses.					ROSS				(indicating the PADD				in Sisko's hand)			There's something else on that			PADD that might interest you.	Ross EXITS as Sisko looks over the PADD, hits a 	control and then smiles at what he sees.					SISKO			Special dispensation from the 			Chief of Starfleet Operations to 			change the name from Sao Paulo 			to... Defiant.	They all smile and exchange pleased looks.					EZRI 			Now what do you think of her?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Dogs...

If we can convince 			Gul Seltan to join us as well, 			we'll have another hundred 			thousand. I'd say that's worth 			the risk.					KIRA 			And you're sure you want me 			along?					DAMAR 			Before they join us, they'll want 			assurances that the Federation 			will support them.					GARAK				(off console) 			We're cleared for standard orbit.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Dogs...

Years of accumulated 	DUST lines every surface, cobwebs in the corners.	We hear the SOUND of a door opening at the top of 	the stairs, and a shaft of LIGHT pierces the gloom.	An old Cardassian woman, MILA (last seen in 	"Improbable Cause"), descends the stairs, followed 	by Kira (wearing some kind of cloak with a hood), 	Garak and Damar. Mila is a cantankerous sort, 	scared and worried about taking our people in.					MILA				(to Garak)			...
