Sisko has his sleeves rolled up and is a whirlwind of 	activity... he's a man in his element, effortlessly tending 	to five different things at once.	There are a few 24th Century HOT-PLATES on the table, with 	SAUCEPANS and SKILLETS on them.	Jake is helping his dad, and we see that the two of them 	make a good team.  Kira and Bashir sit nearby, BEVERAGES and 	HORS D'OEUVRES at hand.	Odo is watching with great interest as Sisko whips something 	in a BOWL with a whisk.					SISKO			Now the secret to a good souffle, 			Constable, is its consistency.  You 			have to be very careful not to 			overwhip it.					ODO			I see...	Sisko is somewhat surprised by Odo's curiosity.					SISKO			I hope I'm not boring you.					ODO			Just because I don't need food, 			Commander, doesn't mean I'm not 			interested in its preparation.  I'm 			fascinated by the humanoid 			preoccupation with eating.	Sisko realizes he needs to turn the fish -- Odo offers to 	take over stirring the souffle.         DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - REV. 08/11/94 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					ODO			May I?					SISKO			By all means.	He hands him the bowl, and Odo takes the whisk in hand.  He 	begins whipping, a little tentatively.					SISKO				(continuing)			Keep it smooth.  That's right... 			it's all in the wrist.	Odo starts to get the hang of it, gets a rhythm going.  Sisko 	smiles, and Odo can't help but smile back.  Sisko turns the 	fish in the skillet and starts expertly chopping something.					BASHIR			Where'd you learn to do that?					SISKO			I used to work summers at my father's 			restaurant in New Orleans.					KIRA			What are we having?  It smells 			delicious.					JAKE			Blackened redfish... with creamed 			spinach and sauteed beets.	Bashir responds with a notable lack of enthusiasm.					BASHIR			Beets... ?					SISKO				(with humor)			You don't like beets, Doctor?	Jake turns toward Bashir as if to warn him of something --					JAKE			Careful --					BASHIR				(uninterrupted)			They're not exactly a personal 			favorite of mine.         DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - REV. 08/11/94 - TEASER          3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			That's because you've never had them 			prepared properly.					JAKE				(to Bashir)			I tried to warn you.					SISKO				(lightly)			The beet is a very misunderstood 			vegetable.					BASHIR				(wry)			Well, I look forward to... 			understanding it better.	Kira can't help but smile.  There's a CHIME at the door.					SISKO			Come in.	DAX ENTERS, looking a little harried.					DAX			What a day... I spent the last six 			hours in one of the upper pylons 			trying to get the new sensor relay 			on-line.					SISKO			Help yourself to something.  Dinner'll 			be ready in a few minutes.					DAX			Great, I've been looking forward to 			it all day.					BASHIR			I hope you like beets.	Sisko smiles and shakes his head...					DAX			Love them.	Bashir shakes his head as if to say, "am I the only one?"  Dax 	crosses over toward the replicator to get something to drink.  	Odo is still whipping away, looking a little like a man trying 	to hold a baby.            DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - 08/10/94 - TEASER            4.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO			Keep at it, Constable -- nice, even 			strokes.	Odo concentrates on what he's doing, and Kira can't help but 	smile.					ODO			Do you find something amusing, Major?					KIRA			I just think you look... cute.	Odo isn't sure whether he considers that a compliment, turns 	his attention to what he's doing.	Dax has found a KEYBOARD sitting on top of a box near the 	replicator.					DAX			Who's is this?					JAKE			It's mine.					DAX			I didn't know you played.	She hesitantly touches the keys, just to hear how they sound.					JAKE			I don't.  I took lessons for a while 			but I wasn't very good.					DAX			I know the feeling.  None of Dax's 			hosts, including Jadzia, had any 			musical ability.					BASHIR				(lightly)			No one ever said life was fair.					DAX			Not even when you've had seven of 			them.	As the conversation continues, Dax continues experimenting 	with the keyboard.  Her playing seems to improve as she 	continues and gains in confidence.         DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - REV. 08/11/94 - TEASER          5.2    CONTINUED:	(4)					DAX			You would think one of us would've 			been born without a tin ear.	Dax manages to pick out a series of chords that have a smooth, 	almost lyrical progression to them.					KIRA			Sounds like one of you had some 			talent, after all.	Dax looks down at the keyboard, suddenly very serious.  She 	concentrates and plays the same piece a second time.					BASHIR			That was lovely.					DAX				(sharply)			Quiet.	Her hands flutter across the keyboard as if trying to remember 	an old skill... but she can't.  She tries to play again, but 	now the music comes out discordant and arbitrary.					DAX				(frustrated)			That's not it...					KIRA			What piece was that?					DAX			I don't know.  I don't think I ever 			heard it before.					BASHIR			Maybe you hit on it by accident.  			You know, beginner's luck.					DAX				(searching her memory)			I know it somehow.					JAKE			Dinner's ready!            DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - 08/10/94 - TEASER            6.2    CONTINUED:	(5)					KIRA				(lightly)			Maybe it's something from your 			childhood.  You'll think of it.	Kira crosses to join the others... but Dax stays by the 	keyboard, stares down at it.

COMMANDER'S OFFICE (VPB)	where Sisko and Dax are sitting playing CHESS.  Sisko is 	studying the board carefully; Dax sits across from him, 	looking a little edgy, trying to hum the tune she played in 	Sisko's quarters.  Sisko looks up at her; her humming is 	making it hard for him to concentrate.					SISKO				(lightly)			Dax, do you mind... ?					DAX			What?					SISKO			Your humming.  It's a little 			distracting.					DAX			Sorry, I didn't realize I was doing 			it.					SISKO			You've been humming that same tune 			ever since we started the game.					DAX			I guess I can't get it out of my 			head.					SISKO			Do me a favor...				(smiles)			-- try.	He studies the board again, and within seconds Dax starts 	mouthing the tune to herself -- it's silent, but still 	distracting.  He sees that she's off in her own world, and 	decides not to make an issue of it.	After a moment, Sisko moves a piece.  When she doesn't seem 	to notice, he gets her attention.					SISKO			Your turn...         DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - REV. 08/11/94 - ACT ONE         8.3    CONTINUED:	Dax takes just a cursory glance at the pieces and counters.  	Sisko seems surprised by her choice, as if he thinks it was 	a bad move.					SISKO			You sure you want to do that?					DAX				(even)			Your move.	Sisko shrugs, if that's the way she wants it.  He moves a 	piece, looks at her.					SISKO			Check.					DAX			Where'd that Knight come from?					SISKO			Your mind's not on the game.					DAX			Oh, so you made an illegal move to 			get my attention... ?	Sisko is taken completely by surprise by the accusation.					SISKO			Of course not.  It was a legal move.				(beat)			Look, maybe we should just call it a 			day.  You obviously have other things 			on your mind.	Dax looks at him, her features cold.					DAX			Curzon always suspected you were a 			cheat.	Sisko can't believe what he's hearing; he's too surprised to 	be angry.					SISKO			Is this some kind of joke?	She holds his gaze... this is no joke.         DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - REV. 08/11/94 - ACT ONE         9.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			You mind telling me what's going on 			here?					DAX			Don't play innocent with me, Benjamin.  			We both know you were trying to cheat 			me.  Why don't you just admit it?	With a sudden movement she upends the board, scattering the 	pieces.  And with that she EXITS the room...

I thought you 			might want to talk about it.					DAX			There's nothing to talk about.					KIRA			You can't really think he tried to 			cheat you?					DAX			I knew you'd take his side.					KIRA			I'm not taking anyone's side.					DAX			In that case... I think you should 			leave.					KIRA			Dax --         DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - REV. 08/15/94 - ACT ONE        10.4    CONTINUED:					DAX			I'm serious, Kira.  Leave.	Kira can't just give up, she's too concerned about her friend.  	She stands there, trying to think of what tack to take.  Dax 	looks up at her, stands.					DAX			Fine, then I'll go.	Dax tries to move past her, but Kira catches her arm.					KIRA			Wait --					DAX				(even)			Get your hands off me... before I do 			something I'll regret.	Kira looks into Dax's eyes... but doesn't see anyone she 	recognizes.  Dax's threat is real, and Kira feels she has no 	choice but to let her go.  Dax holds her gaze for a beat, 	then smiles, as if she's enjoying Kira's discomfort.					DAX			That's the first smart thing you've 			done since you walked over here.	She turns and walks off into the Promenade... we hold on 	Kira's face for a beat and --									CUT TO:5    INT. PROMENADE (VPB)	where Dax is making her way across the central corridor.  	SUPERNUMERARIES go about their daily business, passing this 	way and that.5A   NEW ANGLE	where we see that everyone on the Promenade has suddenly 	disappeared.  The place is empty, deserted.  A LIGHTING CHANGE 	gives the Promenade a mysterious look.	Dax's attention is caught by a strange FIGURE standing on 	the upper level, looking down at her.	The Figure is wearing dark, flowing robes and a strange, 	slightly feminine featured, eyeless MASK.         DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - REV. 08/15/94 - ACT ONE        11.5A   CONTINUED:	Dax seems gripped with fear, visceral and intense.  She tries 	to steel herself, swallow back her fear, but there's something 	about the figure that seems to cut deep into her.	Suddenly she hears a strange SOUND... like an elongated 	musical note, distorted and eerie -- this is a stretched out 	version of the melody Dax played in the Teaser, and as the 	scene progresses, the piece will continue beyond the point 	we've already heard.	Dax looks away from the figure to see if anyone else is 	around, but the place is deserted.	When she looks back, the figure is gone.  She looks around, 	trying to find him again.	Something in her peripheral vision catches her eye -- she 	turns and sees the masked figure standing in the center of 	the lower level.  It seems impossible that he could have 	moved there so quickly, but there he is.	The figure stands with its hand held about face high... it 	slowly passes its hand across its face and in a single, 	impossibly seamless movement, removes the mask and reveals a 	second mask underneath.  This mask is also eyeless, and the 	markings inscribed on it are more blunt and angular, with a 	somewhat masculine quality.6    ON DAX	as she reacts to this strange transformation.  It's bizarre, 	frightening.  The MUSIC continues and Dax decides to get the 	hell out of there.         DEEP SPACE: "Equilibrium" - REV. 08/15/94 - ACT ONE        12.6    CONTINUED:	She moves off, fighting the urge to break into a run.  As 	she comes around the free-standing directory console, she has 	to stop short to keep from running into the masked figure -- 	it's standing directly in her path, not six feet away.	Before Dax even has time to react the figure reaches up and 	tears off its mask, ripping it in half -- revealing a 	sinister, identifiably masculine mask, from behind which 	piercing humanoid eyes stare at her.	Dax gasps, steps back... and bumps smack into someone -- she 	reacts, startled, and we --									CUT TO:7    OMITTED8    NEW ANGLE - NORMAL LIGHTING	where we see that Dax has backed into QUARK.  The Promenade 	is full of people as before.  Quark sees her troubled 	expression.					QUARK			Something wrong, Lieutenant?	Dax doesn't answer; when she turns back toward the masked 	figure, he's gone.
