SISKO'S RESTAURANT - DAY	Moments later. SISKO is still trying to grasp the 	fact that his old friend, DAX, is standing before 	him -- albeit, in a different body. JAKE and JOSEPH 	stand nearby, well aware of the awkwardness of the 	moment.					SISKO			Dax? I can't believe it...					EZRI 			I can hardly believe it myself. 			But I'm Dax... I mean, I'm not 			Jadzia Dax. I'm Ezri Dax. But I 			have all of Jadzia's memories. 			Not to mention Lela's, Tobin's, 			Emony's, Audrid's, Joran's, 			Curzon's...				(a beat) 			Am I forgetting anyone?					SISKO			Torias?					EZRI 			Right. You're probably asking 			yourself -- who is this person? 			How did she get the Dax symbiont? 			Do I even want another Dax in my 			life? Does she always talk this 			much? These are all good 			questions.				(a beat) 			I wish I had good answers.					SISKO			The answers can wait. Right now, 			I'm just glad to see you.					EZRI				(fighting back the 				tears) 			Really? That's so nice of you to 			say.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shadows and...

Or am I 			shorter?				(to Sisko) 			You know, none of this is my 			fault. I never asked to be 			joined.					JAKE 			Then how'd you end up with the 			symbiont?					EZRI 			It was an accident.					JOSEPH 			Some accident.					EZRI 			I was on the Destiny when the Dax 			symbiont was brought on board to 			be taken back to Trill. Halfway 			through the trip, it took a turn 			for the worse and had to be 			placed in a host immediately.					SISKO				(putting it together) 			And you were the only Trill on 			board.					EZRI				(nodding) 			I laid down on the operating 			table as one person and woke up a 			different person... actually, 			eight different people. I wasn't 			prepared for any of it. You're 			supposed to go through years of 			training and preparation before 			being joined. All I got was a 			fifteen minute lecture from the 			ships's surgeon. And he wasn't 			even a Trill.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shadows and...

Wasn't there anything 			they could do for you?					EZRI 			I did meet with the Evaluation 			Board several times.					SISKO			And?					EZRI 			They gave me some books to 			read... some counseling... but 			once the host and the symbiont 			are joined, there's really not 			much they can do. 				(a beat) 			My parents, my friends, my 			crewmates... it's like they don't 			know me anymore -- which is 			understandable since I hardly 			know myself. 				(a beat) 			That's why I took a leave of 			absence and came here. If anyone 			can help me through this, it's 			you.					SISKO			I'll do all I can, but the truth 			is, we're leaving for Tyree...					EZRI 			Fine. I'll come with you.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shadows and...

It'll be like old times. 				(a beat)			Except different.	Sisko and Jake can't argue with that either.

A solemn 	O'BRIEN and BASHIR stand alongside GENERAL MARTOK 	and the KLINGON BRIDGE CREW.

And after a moment's hesitation, 	O'Brien and Bashir each pick up a blade that has 	been set before them.5    ANGLE ON THE DOOR	to see QUARK ENTER, carrying a travel bag.					QUARK			Quark, son of Keldar, reporting for --	Quark hesitates as he sees everyone staring at him, 	holding knives.					QUARK			Did I come at a bad time?					O'BRIEN 			What are you doing here, Quark?					QUARK 			Same thing you are. I'm 			volunteering for this mission.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shadows and... " - REV. 08/11/98 - ACT ONE     6.5    CONTINUED:					MARTOK 			Why? You're a bartender, not a 			warrior.					QUARK			True, but I loved Jadzia as much 			as anyone in this room.				(off Worf's look) 			With maybe one or two 			exceptions...				(getting back to the 				point) 			And I'm willing to pledge my life 			to see that she gets into Sto-vo-kor.					MARTOK				(pleased with 				Quark's words) 			Perhaps there is some Klingon in 			you after all.					QUARK 			I wouldn't go that far. 			So why all the cutlery?					MARTOK 			We shed our blood to prove we are 			not frightened of death.	And with that Worf, Martok and the other Klingons 	slice the palms of their own hands. O'Brien and 	Bashir exchange a look, then they too cut their 	palms. Everyone looks to Quark.					QUARK 			Can't you just take my word for 			it?	Martok grabs Quark's hand and quickly slices his 	open palm.					QUARK			Oww! That hurts.					O'BRIEN			It's supposed to hurt.6    ANGLE ON WORF	as he steps over to the bulkhead and smears his 	bloody palm across it, anointing the ship.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shadows and...

Sisko applies a hypo to 	her neck.					EZRI 			This is so embarrassing.	ADJUST to include Joseph and Jake standing nearby.					SISKO 			Don't worry about it. It's not 			your fault.					EZRI 			I'm a trained Starfleet officer. 			I have no business getting space 			sick. But ever since I was given 			the symbiont, warp speed makes me 			a little queasy.					JAKE				(an understatement)			A little queasy... ?	Sisko's look silences Jake.					JOSEPH 			The main thing is that the control 			panel's all cleaned up... so if 			one of you would like to get back 			into the pilot's seat, it would 			sure make me feel better.	Sisko nods and sits back down in the pilot's seat.					JOSEPH 			Not that I don't trust the 			computer.					JAKE 			You just prefer the human touch.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shadows and...

He was one of your 			previous hosts, wasn't he?					EZRI				(nodding) 			He died in a shuttle accident. 			I still remember those last few 			seconds before the crash...				(more to herself) 			Maybe I don't belong in Starfleet 			anymore...				(faux cheeriness) 			Aren't you glad I came along?	Ezri gets up and moves towards the food replicator 	in the back.
