We neither hear the dialogue nor see 	the Admiral on the monitor.	We do see Sisko trying to keep his temper while emphatically 	responding to the Admiral's heated inquiries.	They are mid-conversation as the scene begins...					SISKO				(bristling)			I'm hoping I don't have to remind 			the admiral how many people pass 			through here during a week's time.  			It's not possible to keep tabs on 			every single person while they're on 			the station...					ADMIRAL				(hard)			If I didn't know you better, 			commander, I'd think you were just 			making excuses...					SISKO				(heatedly)			I'm not making excuses!  Would it be 			in keeping with Federation policy to 			frisk everyone who steps through our 			airlocks?  To search every room of 			every visitor during their stay?					ADMIRAL				(forcefully)			Of course not... but with two 			kidnappings and a ship being 			destroyed... all in less than a 			week's time... obviously your security 			measures leave something to be 			desired...					SISKO			Security on this station is by the 			book.  Our security program and the 			officers who work in it are first- 			rate.           DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, I" - ADDENDUM SCENE 47           2.CONTINUED:					ADMIRAL			Then what were they doing when all 			this was happening?  We here at 			Starfleet are watching how you resolve 			this situation very closely, 			commander.  We think it might be 			prudent to replace this chief of 			security you have...					SISKO			Odo is both highly intelligent and 			extremely thorough.  He's the most 			qualified person I have for the job.					ADMIRAL			Still, it would be a concrete example 			that you are taking active measures 			to resolve this situation... and to 			make sure it doesn't happen again.					SISKO			I stand behind my chief of security 			one hundred percent.					ADMIRAL				(with an edge)			That may be a mistake, Commander...					SISKO				(controlled fury)			Then it's my mistake.					ADMIRAL			Then let me make my point again.  			Starfleet is very unhappy this has 			happened.  We want this matter taken 			care of immediately.  I don't have 			to remind you how this reflects on 			your position...					SISKO			We're doing everything we can to 			apprehend the kidnappers...					ADMIRAL			Don't bother me with details.  Just 			clean up the mess, Commander.  And 			quickly.  Before this becomes a 			permanent stain on your record.  			Do I make myself clear?           DEEP SPACE: "The Maquis, I" - ADDENDUM SCENE 47           3.CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO				(angrily)			Yes, sir.	The Admiral's image disappears from the monitor.	(Then we will pick up at "In his office, Sisko drops his 	head...
