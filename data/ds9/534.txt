QUARK'S	Business as usual. The only difference is that LEETA 	is serving drinks behind the bar. ODO, on duty, is 	giving the place the once over.2    ANGLE ON THE DOOR	as QUARK ENTERS followed by THREE BAJORAN MAINTENANCE 	WORKERS, each carrying a large crate.					QUARK			Just set them on the bar.	MORN, seated at the bar, begins to examine one of the 	crates.					QUARK			Morn -- no touching.	Quark protectively moves over to the crates.					QUARK			You know what this is?				(playing to the crowd)			Three cases of syrup of squill.	The crowd BUZZES in reaction.					LEETA			I love syrup of squill on my			groatcakes. But I haven't seen			a jar in over a year.					QUARK			No one has.					ODO			Does that mean the drought on			Balancar's over? DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - TEASER 2.2    CONTINUED:					QUARK				(pleased with himself) 			There never was a drought on 			Balancar. It was all a ploy by 			their Agricultural Consortium. 			They've been stockpiling squill 			so they could drive the price up.					LEETA				(indignant) 			That's dishonest.					QUARK 			I couldn't agree more. You see, 			I once did some business with the 			nephew of the cousin of the 			stepsister of a friend of the 			secretary to the Consortium's 			chief accountant...				(stopping, double-				checking with himself) 			Nephew, cousin, stepsister, 			friend... yeah, that's right. And 			he told me, in passing, that the 			accountant had bought himself a 			pair of very nice Ferengi rain 			slippers.					ODO 			If there was a drought, he 			wouldn't need rain slippers.					QUARK 			My thoughts exactly.				(boastful) 			So I set up a meeting with this 			accountant and told him that he 			either provide me with a shipment 			of syrup, or I'd expose their 			deception to the entire quadrant. 			Tomorrow morning, we're having a 			special on groatcakes, topped with 			syrup of squill -- that is, for 			everyone who can afford it.	The crowd reacts with anticipation; Quark looks at the 	maintenance workers. DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - TEASER 3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK 			What are you standing around for? Get 			these crates in the storeroom -- this 			stuff is worth its weight in latinum.				(to the room) 			Which reminds me of another little 			economic exploit of mine...				(musing) 			It happened, oh, I'd say... eleven, 			twelve years ago, shortly before I 			arrived here...	But Quark loses the crowd's attention as they are drawn 	to something off screen --3    ANGLE ON THE DOOR	as DAX, O'BRIEN and BASHIR ENTER and make their way to 	one of the tables. The group looks spent, as if they've 	just been to hell and back, which they have.					LEETA 			Dax, Julian -- you're back! I was 			so worried.					DAX 			I told you it was going to be okay.					LEETA 			Then why all the secrecy about your 			mission?					O'BRIEN 			Because we aren't supposed to talk 			about it.					BASHIR 			But now it's okay. The mission's 			over, we've been debriefed.				(to Leeta) 			We took the Defiant behind enemy 			lines.					O'BRIEN				(with pride)			We're the first reconnaissance			mission into Cardassian space since			the Dominion's retreat. DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - TEASER 4.3    CONTINUED: 					O'BRIEN (Cont'd) 				(a beat) 			The first to make it back, anyway.	Everyone in the bar is listening to this conversation, 	in fact, the crowd has gathered around their table, 	anxious to hear any news.					DAX 			And if that's not a reason to 			celebrate, then I don't know what 			is...					O'BRIEN			Three synthales.					LEETA 				(nods) 			Coming right up.4    ANGLE ON QUARK AND ODO	still at the bar. Quark is looking glum.					ODO			Something wrong, Quark?					QUARK 			Yes, something's wrong -- a bunch 			of self-satisfied Starfleet 			officers just stole my audience.					ODO			They're not just Starfleet 			officers -- they're heroes. And 			let's face it, Quark, there's 			nothing heroic about earning 			profit.					QUARK			There is on Ferenginar. DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - TEASER 5.4    CONTINUED: 					ODO			We're not on Ferenginar.	A Ferengi waiter approaches Quark and whispers 	something in his ear.					QUARK 			The Nagus... calling me -- now? 				(suddenly worried) 			He must've found out about the 			squill... I'll have to send him 			a jar -- better make it a dozen. 			He loves squill.	Quark hurries off to the backroom.5    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.6    INT. CONDUITS	Where we find ROM, working away at an open panel 	After a beat, Quark approaches, crawling on all fours.					QUARK 			There you are. I've been looking 			all over the station for you.					ROM 			Well, you found me. 				(joking) 			Now you go hide and I'll search 			for you.	Quark puts a consoling arm around his brother's 	shoulder.					QUARK 			Rom, brace yourself. I have bad 			news. Our mother's been taken 			prisoner by the Dominion.					ROM			Moogie -- a prisoner? DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - TEASER 6.6    CONTINUED:	Rom's knees buckle figuratively, Quark has to hold him 	up.					QUARK			It gets worse.7    CLOSER	as Quark resigns himself to his fate.					QUARK			The Nagus wants me to rescue her.					ROM				(disbelief)			You? Rescue Moogie? From the			Dominion?				(as the implications 				sink in)			Uh-oh.					QUARK			"Uh-oh" is right.	Rom looks at his brother and they share an expression 	of impending doom as we:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                          DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)8    INT. CONDUITS	Quark leads Rom on all fours as they crawl through the 	conduits.					ROM 			So how do you plan on rescuing 			Moogie?					QUARK 			You mean how do we plan on 			rescuing Moogie.					ROM 			I don't recall you saying the 			Nagus wanted me to go along.					QUARK 			Maybe he doesn't -- but I do. 			Besides, Ishka is your mother, too.					ROM 			And I love her. But I can't go 			with you. I'm a married man. I 			have responsibilities. And my 			responsibilities don't want me to 			die.					QUARK 			I don't want to die either. So 			let's just concentrate on the 			reward the Nagus is offering.	That gets Rom's attention.					ROM 			Reward?					QUARK 			Fifty bars of gold-pressed latinum.					ROM 			Fifty bars!DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 8.8    CONTINUED:	Rom reacts to the size of the reward by raising his 	head and bumping it on the low conduit ceiling.					ROM 			Ow.	Rom rubs his dome.8A   ANOTHER ANGLE	as they emerge into a conduit junction.					QUARK 			Which I'm willing to share with you.					ROM 			An even split?					QUARK			Absolutely. Thirty bars for me 			and twenty for you.	QUARK starts crawling again. Rom follows.					ROM 			That's not even.					QUARK			It is when you include my finder's fee.	QUARK climbs the ladder to access another conduit. Rom 	follows.					ROM				(oh, yeah) 			Right.9    ANOTHER SECTION OF CONDUIT	Moments later. Quark and Rom continue crawling.					ROM 			There's one thing I still don't 			understand. How did the Dominion 			get a hold of Moogie?					QUARK			They captured the transport ship 			she was on.DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 9.9    CONTINUED:					ROM				(confused) 			But she's a female -- they're 			forbidden to travel off of 			Ferenginar.					QUARK 			Moogie's an exception. The Nagus 			gave her special dispensation to 			travel to Vulcan for her operation.					ROM 			What operation?					QUARK				(dismissive) 			She wanted to have her ears raised.					ROM 			I had no idea...					QUARK			That she was so vain?10   ANOTHER SECTION OF CONDUIT	Quark and Rom continue crawling.					ROM 			That the Nagus could be so 			generous.				(a beat) 			But why is he being so good to 			Moogie?					QUARK 			Brother, there's something I need 			to tell you...					ROM 			You mean that ten bars of latinum 			is an overly generous finder's 			fee? I already know that.DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 10.10   CONTINUED:					QUARK				(shaking his head)			It's about the Nagus and Moogie.					ROM			What about them?					QUARK			They're lovers.					ROM				(with amazed disbelief)			Noooo.					QUARK			It's been going on for over a year.					ROM			Noooo.					QUARK			She's his secret financial			advisor -- she helps him run the			entire Ferengi Alliance.					ROM			Noooo.					QUARK				(frustrated)			Would you stop saying that.	Quark approaches an access panel and pushes it open --11   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS	Quark and Rom look out of the opened access panel.					SISKO (O.S.)			Can I help you, gentlemen?11A  NEW ANGLE	to see SISKO staring down at them from his desk.					ROM				(to Quark)			I was following you.DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 10A.11A  CONTINUED:					QUARK				(to Sisko)			We must've taken a wrong turn.					SISKO			Looks that way.	Rom and Quark inch back into the conduit and close the 	access panel behind them. Sisko smiles to himself and 	returns to his work.11B  INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR	An access panel opens and Quark and Rom stick there 	heads out.					QUARK			Much better.	They emerge into the hallway and Rom closes the panel 	behind them. Quark tries to get some feeling back into 	his legs.DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 11.11B  CONTINUED:					ROM 			You know, brother... I've been 			thinking. We can't rescue Moogie 			from a Dominion internment 			center -- not alone anyway.					QUARK 			You're right. We're going to need 			help.					ROM 			We could put together a commando			team. Gather the toughest 			mercenaries we can find... 			Nausicaans, Breen, Klingons.	That stops Quark from pumping his legs -- an idea forms 	in his mind.					QUARK 			We don't need Nausicaans -- or 			Breen or Klingons.					ROM 			Hew-mons?					QUARK 			We'll just use Ferengi.					ROM 			Then we'll all die.					QUARK 			No we won't. Ferengi can be just 			as tough as Klingons.					ROM 			They can?DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 12.11B  CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK 			Of course they can -- they just 			need the opportunity, the 			training, and a couple of bars of 			latinum as incentive.					ROM 			Coming out of my share, I suppose.					QUARK			No, we'll split the reward with 			whoever joins us. All twenty bars 			of it.					ROM 			But the Nagus offered fifty.					QUARK			As far as anyone else is 			concerned, he said twenty.					ROM				(happier)			Twenty it is then.					QUARK 			Now the question is, who's our 			first recruit?	And off of this moment --12   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL - CLOSE ON NOG					NOG 			Not me.	PULL BACK to REVEAL that Nog is flanked by Quark and 	Rom.					ROM			But Nog, Moogie needs you!					QUARK			Not to mention your Nagus.					ROM 			They need you -- we need you. Say 			you'll join us.DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 13.12   CONTINUED:					ROM (Cont'd)				(supplicating) 			Please.					NOG 			I'm a Starfleet Officer. I can't 			go running off with you on some 			half-baked rescue mission. I have 			duties to perform.					ROM 			But you know how to fire a phaser.					QUARK			Forget it, Rom. Don't beg.				(to Nog) 			Too bad, though. We were going 			to make you strategic operations 			officer.	That gets Nog's attention.					NOG 			You mean like Commander Worf?					QUARK			Exactly like Commander Worf.				(the hard sell) 			Think of it, Nog -- you'll devise 			the tactics... come up with a plan 			of action.					ROM				(the harder sell) 			You can be the team's drill 			instructor. Put us through our 			paces! Prepare us for combat!					QUARK 			Turn us into soldiers.					NOG 			That's a big job.					QUARK				(putting a hand on Nog's 				shoulder) 			That's why we need you.DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 14.12   CONTINUED:	(2)	Nog thinks it over.					NOG 			How big is the team?					QUARK 			Right now...	Quark holds up two fingers. After a beat, Nog shakes 	his head and corrects him by holding up three. And on 	their smiles, we go to --13   INT. QUARK'S QUARTERS	CLOSE ON a monitor displaying a Ferengi Alliance 	symbol. PULL BACK to REVEAL Quark and Rom, sitting in 	front of the monitor.					QUARK 			Now remember, Leck is not your 			typical Ferengi. His priorities 			are... different from ours.					ROM 			I understand, Brother.					QUARK 			No you don't, but you will.14   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as Quark taps a panel and the monitor comes to life 	with the face of LECK, last seen -- albeit briefly -- 	in "Ferengi Love Songs." Leck is sharpening a 	dangerous-looking throwing knife.					LECK 			I hope this is a secure channel.					QUARK 				(nodding) 			I followed your instructions to 			the letter.					LECK 			Very good. Who do you want 			eliminated?DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 15.14   CONTINUED:					QUARK			It's not that kind of job.					LECK 			Then why call an eliminator?					ROM				(sotto, to Quark) 			What's an eliminator?					QUARK				(to Rom)			Shh.				(to Leck) 			I'm putting together a little 			rescue mission and I'd like you 			to be part of my team.					LECK 			I work alone.					QUARK			You'll be paid in latinum.					LECK			I don't care about latinum.					ROM				(to Quark, sotto) 			You're right. His priorities are 			different.	But Quark's eyes remain fixed on Leck; and if the 	eliminator's lack of greed bothers Quark, Quark doesn't 	show it.					QUARK 			All right, forget the latinum. 			I'm told you like an opportunity 			to test your abilities.					LECK 			I enjoy a challenge.					QUARK				(moving in for the kill) 			Then you should know this -- the 			person we're going to rescue is 			being held by the Dominion.DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 16.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					LECK				(eyes lighting up) 			The Dominion?					QUARK			Should be quite a challenge...	As Leck considers this, a smile breaks across his lips. 	Quark and Rom exchange a look, Rom holds up four 	fingers.15   EXT.

Rom looks at 	Quark, then holds up five fingers.18   INT. QUARK'S	The bar is closed for the evening. Quark, Rom, Gaila, 	and Leck are seated with their backs to the bar. 	Behind each one of them, on the bar, is a Ferengi PADD. 	Nog, "the little colonel," paces around them.					NOG 			On the bar, you will find a PADD 			with a schematic of a Dominion 			internment center. You may now 			examine the schematic.DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Magnificent Ferengi" - REV. 10/24/97 - ACT ONE 18.18   CONTINUED:	The four "trainees" do as instructed.
