He looks	forward to this time with her, and does everything he	can to make sure that she enjoys it, too.	Odo places a PADD on the front edge of his desk, square	with the corner, facing away from him, then stands and	moves around to the front of his desk. He pulls a	CHAIR over so that it faces the desk, positions it just	so. He then crosses to the replicator.					ODO			One Raktajino, extra hot... two			measures of kava.	We hear the SOUND of the replicator working, and then	Odo turns back to his desk with the raktajino in hand.	He sets it down next to the PADD, being careful to make	sure that the cup's handle is facing the chair.	He studies the set-up for a beat, and when satisfied, 	crosses back behind his desk and takes a seat.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - TEASER           2.1    CONTINUED:	He picks up his PADD so as to look busy, and a beat	later, KIRA ENTERS from the Promenade and greets Odo	with a smile.					KIRA			Good morning.					ODO			Major.	She slides into the seat Odo prepared for her, picks up	the raktajino and takes a sip.					KIRA			Mmm...				(picking up PADD)			So... how many have we got?					ODO			Sixteen items.					KIRA				(wry)			The station's criminal element has			been busy this week.					ODO			Nothing out of the ordinary; three			petty thefts, two incidents of			disorderly conduct, one assault...	Kira has been reading along as Odo ticks them off, and	her attention is caught by a familiar name.					KIRA			Ijarna's wife hit him again? Why			does he stay with her?					ODO				(see for yourself)			Skip to item twelve.	Kira skims the list until she finds it.					KIRA			Public lewdness.					ODO			The same night Ijarna reported the			assault, I caught him and his			wife...				(you know)			... behind the information kiosk on			the second level.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - TEASER           3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA				(smiling)			That answers my question...	Kira continues reading, and we might catch Odo watching	her over the top edge of his PADD. Truth is, he knows	these reports by heart, and only goes through the	formality of reviewing them with Kira as an excuse to	spend time with her.					KIRA			What about item seven?					ODO			One of my deputies found Ojuy Gel			scrawling political graffiti on a			wall in section four.					KIRA			He's always riled up about			something, isn't he? what was it			this time?					ODO			He was protesting First Minister			Shakaar's upcoming visit to the			station.					KIRA				(nodding)			He's been handing out leaflets			saying that Shakaar should drop			the petition to join the			Federation.					ODO			Leaflets are one thing, vandalism			is quite another. Ojuy spent a			night in a holding cell for his			trouble, and I understand the			Arbiter sentenced him to three			weeks of community service...				(with satisfaction)			-- on Sanitation Duty.	Kira can't help but smile at Odo's evident pleasure in	this fact.					KIRA			Just make sure he scrubs that wall			clean before Shakaar gets here.			I don't want him to see it.	Odo nods. Just then QUARK ENTERS, looking harried and	maybe a little tired.					QUARK			I'd like to file a complaint.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - TEASER           4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					ODO			Not now, Quark.					QUARK				(accusing)			A noise complaint.				(pointing at Odo)			Against you.	Odo is not about to let Quark interfere with his time	with Kira.					ODO			We're conducting station business.					QUARK				(to Kira)			My quarters are right below his.			You wouldn't believe the racket he			makes.					ODO			Quark.					QUARK			Do you know what it's like to hear			someone practice shape-shifting?			Last night, it sounded like a			Takaran wildebeest was tromping			around up there.					ODO			That was for all of five minutes.			Once you complained, I took the			form of a Rafalian mouse.					QUARK			Yeah, little tiny feet skittering			across the floor...				(skin crawling)			back and forth, back and			forth...					KIRA			You could hear that?	Quark points to both of his ears simultaneously.					QUARK				(what do you think?)			Hello... ?				(beat)			Sometimes I can even hear him...				(with a shudder)			-- oozing around.             DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - TEASER           5.1    CONTINUED:	(5)					KIRA			Maybe you should change quarters.					QUARK			Maybe he should have a little more			consideration. Shape-shifting in			the middle of the night, there			ought to be a regulation against			it.					ODO			Come back in half an hour, I'll be			happy to take your complaint then.					QUARK			Oh, I'll be back. You can count			on that.	And with that, Quark turns and EXITS. Kira and Odo	watch him go, then turn to look at each other...					KIRA			It's just Quark's luck that you'd			be assigned quarters right above			his...	A beat, then...					ODO			Luck had nothing to do with it...	Kira iooks at him for a moment, and finally a faint	smile traces itself on his features. As she realizes	what he means and breaks into a grin...2    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (STOCK OPTICAL)	as a Bajoran transport (or some other stock vessel)	approaches the station.3    INT.

It does show			off your figure.					O'BRIEN			Why, thank you.	DAX hurries up, still straightening her uniform, and	moves to join the group. Sisko decides to give her a	bit of a hard time, though it's all in good fun.					SISKO			Good of you to make it, old man.			Shakaar's transport just docked.					DAX			Sorry. There were so many people			on the Promenade it was hard to			get through.	Kira turns to Sisko, speaks in a low voice.					KIRA			I hope Shakaar's gotten better at			talking in front of groups. He			used to mumble his way through			mission briefings; everyone in our			resistance cell had to learn to			lip read.	Sisko smiles at this... just then, SHAKAAR, his	Adjutant, SARISH REZ, and TWO SECURITY GUARDS begin to	emerge from the airlock.	Despite his new position, Shakaar has maintained an	unpretentious style of dress and a down-to-earth	manner. Still, he knows that pomp and ceremony can be	important, and knows how to handle himself on these	occasions.					SISKO			Welcome to Deep Space Nine,			minister.					SHAKAAR			Thank you, Captain. I've been			looking forward to visiting the			station... and meeting the			Emissary.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - TEASER           7.3    CONTINUED:	(2)	Sisko smiles a slightly uncomfortable acknowledgement.					SISKO				(gesturing)			This is part of my senior staff:			Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax,			Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien,			Doctor BASHIR, and, of course, you			know my first officer, Major Kira.	Shakaar breaks into a grin when he sees her.					SHAKAAR			Nerys...					KIRA			It's good to see you, Edon...	Though the two old friends have much more to say to	each other, this is neither the time or the place.					SHAKAAR				(wry)			I guess I should introduce my			senior staff...				(gesturing)			Here he is.	Sarish smiles at his boss's humor, introduces himself	to					SARISH			Sarish Rez, the first minister's			adjutant.	Sisko nods a greeting.					SISKO			A pleasure.				(indicating)			This way.

Sisko and Kira are still in dress	uniform.					ODO				(to Sarish)			As far as I'm concerned we			should've gotten the First			Minister off that podium as soon			as we received the information.					SARISH			If Shakaar canceled his public			appearances every time someone			threatened his life, he'd never			leave his office.					ODO			We're not talking about some			disgruntled shopkeeper who writes			a letter threatening Shakaar for			raising taxes, we're talking about			a Cardassian extremist group			that's already succeeded in			assassinating two Bajoran			officials.					SARISH			I know all about "The True Way"			and what they're capable of.					ODO			My sources in the Cardassian			Civilian Government believe "The			True Way" already has an operative			in place aboard the station. I			suggest you cancel the First			Minister's conference and			reschedule it at another location.					SARISH			Absolutely not. Nothing is going			to keep Shakaar from meeting with			those Delegates tomorrow.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - ACT ONE         11.6    CONTINUED:					SARISH (Cont'd)			Bajor's effort to join the			Federation hinges on what happens			over the next few days.					SISKO			Shouldn't the decision be up to			the First Minister?					SARISH			It will be. But I already know			what he's going to say.					KIRA			So do I. Shakaar knows better			than anyone that you can't			capitulate to terrorists. He used			to be one, and the day the			Cardassians started negotiating			with him was the day he knew			they'd been beaten.				(beat)			He'll stay.					SISKO			I suppose I'd do the same thing if			I were in his position.				(turning to Odo)			Constable, I want station security			stepped up for the duration of			Shakaar's visit.	Odo accepts this without further argument.					ODO				(nodding)			The First Minister will have round-			the-clock protection.

It			appears to be next to impossible			on this station.					ODO			It's not easy.					WORF			I prefer a more... orderly			environment.	This gets Odo's attention, and he studies Worf for a	moment.					ODO			We have that in common. My people			have an innate need for order.					WORF			How do you tolerate living here?					ODO			I make order where I can. For one			thing, I have a daily routine, and			I follow it unwaveringly. The			shopkeepers on the Promenade joke			that they can set their clocks by			me.					WORF			Unfortunately, I have found it			difficult to establish a routine			here.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - ACT ONE        11B.6A   CONTINUED:	Odo goes on to offer another suggestion.					ODO			There are other ways to create			order in your life. Your			quarters, for example. Everything			in mine has its specific place.			And it's all arranged just so.	Worf's eyes go wide as he realizes they have this in	common.					WORF			Yes... mine, too. Even with my			eyes closed, I would still know			where everything was.					ODO			Exactly.					WORF			I couldn't tolerate it any other			way.					ODO			And I'll tell you what else to do.			Make sure everyone knows that they			can't just "drop by" your quarters			to say hello.	Worf nods thoughtfully.					ODO			If someone does, whatever happens,			don't make them feel welcome.	They're co-conspirators now, it's them against the	forces of chaos.					WORF			Of course not. That would 			invite subsequent visits.					ODO			Precisely.					WORF			So far, the only person who has a			tendency to "drop by" is Chief			O'Brien.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - ACT ONE            6A   CONTINUED: 	(2)					ODO			That's probably because he knows			you from the Enterprise.					WORF				(thoughtful)			Perhaps if I am more inhospitable,			he will stop.					ODO				(I hope so)			Good luck.	A moment as the two men privately consider the	difficulties of life on the station...					ODO			Well...

A quiet moment passes as they stand	together surveying the crowd... there's nothing awkward	about the silence between them, they're good enough	friends to be wordless with each other...					KIRA			You know, I've been meaning to ask			you...				(indicating his waist)			... how come you don't wear that			belt anymore?	Odo never imagined that someone would notice something	like that and it takes him off guard.					ODO			I don't know.				(looks down at himself)			It didn't really serve a			purpose... it's not as if I			needed it to hold my pants up.					KIRA			I just thought it looked good on			you, that's all.	Odo is a little flustered by her attention to this.					ODO			Really?					KIRA			Really.	Odo feels absurdly pleased with Kira's attention.					ODO			If you say so...          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - ACT ONE        18A.17A  NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as Odo MORPHS a belt around his waist.					ODO			Better?					KIRA			Much.	Odo nods, feeling a bit like a Beau Brummel.

Shakaar sits on a nearby chair, and a small	silence settles between the two men for a beat.					SHAKAAR			You know... I realize I haven't			made your job any easier the past			few days.					ODO			I can't argue with that.	Shakaar can't help but smile at Odo's honesty.					SHAKAAR			I want to be sure you understand			that I appreciate your			thoroughness.					ODO			Thank you.	An awkward moment... then Shakaar decides to dive in.					SHAKAAR			Odo...

If he had blood in his veins, it	would go cold. It takes him a moment to reply.					ODO			Hmm... let me think.				(a beat, then flat)			No.	Shakaar is not happy to hear this.					SHAKAAR			I see.	A quiet moment...					SHAKAAR			I've known Nerys for over ten			years.

If			she hasn't said anything to you,			then this whole thing is probably			just in my head.	Odo is not about to admit that he really doesn't know	Kira's heart. But there is one thing he does believe:					ODO			Frankly, I think she's still			grieving for Vedek Bareil.					SHAKAAR			Of course. It's only natural.				(considers)			Maybe I just need to be patient.					ODO			That's... what I would do.					SHAKAAR			On the other hand, maybe I should			let her know how I feel.

I thought you did too.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - ACT FIVE        56A.62   CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO			Of course.	Kira knows Odo well enough to see there's something	more going on here than scheduling conflicts.					KIRA			Odo... is something wrong?					ODO			It's just a matter of... using my			time more efficiently.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95.- ACT FIVE         57.62   CONTINUED:	(3)	She also knows him well enough to know that he can't be	pushed into talking.					KIRA			I understand.					ODO			Well...	When he steps toward the door, Kira notices he's no	longer sporting the belt.					KIRA			No belt?	He considers how best to put it...					ODO			I'm just trying to keep to the			essentials, Major...					KIRA				(nodding)			See you.	And with that, he EXITS... off Kira's face as she	contemplates his visit...63   INT. QUARK'S	where Quark is working behind the bar as Odo ENTERS.	SUPERNUMERARIES as needed. Quark thinks he knows why	Odo's here.					QUARK			They're upstairs.					ODO			Who?					QUARK			Kira and Shakaar. They're in			Holosuite Three, practicing the			speech he's going to give tomorrow			before he leaves. I hear he's			going to announce that the			Federation has agreed to cut the			timetable for Bajor's admittance.					ODO			Where'd you hear that?					QUARK				(covering)			Just a rumor.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - ACT FIVE         58.63   CONTINUED:					ODO			Are you sure you haven't been			listening in on your holosuites			again?					QUARK			Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.			I don't have the right equipment.					ODO			Not anymore.	Quark frowns at the memory of what Odo did to his	eavesdropping device.					QUARK			By the way, I dropped by your			quarters this morning.					ODO			Oh?					QUARK			I heard some noise, and when I			went up there to complain, I found			a work crew installing			soundproofing in the floor. I			have to say, Odo, I'm touched.			That you would do something like			that for me...	Odo is not about to admit to Quark that he's doing it	for him.					ODO			I'm having the floor...			reinforced. The fact that they're			soundproofing it as well is			incidental.					QUARK			Uh-huh...					ODO			If you think I'd put up with three			days of construction for your			sake, think again.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Crossfire" - 11/27/95 - ACT FIVE         59.63   CONTINUED:	(2)	Quark knows the rules of their engagements as well as	Odo does. Just as Odo let him pretend it was "just	business" in his quarters, Quark returns the favor...					QUARK			I guess I should've known.			Thanks, anyway...	Now that they're square.					ODO			Don't mention it.	A customer calls Quark over, and he moves off to take	his order. Odo turns away from the bar in time to	see...64   KIRA AND SHAKAAR 	coming down the staircase from the second level. Even	though the assassin has been caught, there are Guards	in front and behind them.	Odo watches as they make their way to a table, laughing	and smiling, eyes only for each other...	A moment as he watches... then he turns and EXITS to	the Promenade.
