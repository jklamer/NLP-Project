COMMANDER'S OFFICE	DAX and O'BRIEN are standing before the Commander's desk as 	SISKO examines a series of files on his access monitor.					O'BRIEN			What's funny is where the files were 			located: right there in Ops protocols.					DAX			The encryption system was extremely 			easy to break.					SISKO				(looking up)			So they wanted us to find these.					DAX			Or they didn't care.	Sisko pops out a data clip and the monitor goes blank.					SISKO			Well, there's nothing of strategic 			value here.  Just personal logs and 			some files on Bajoran terrorists.  			But it is a glimpse into the 			Cardassian mind.					O'BRIEN			You might want to warn Kira before 			she sees her file.	KIRA ENTERS at that moment and Sisko immediately stands.					KIRA			Warn me about what?					SISKO			Oh, ah, Dax and Chief O'Brien 			discovered some of the last Prefect's 			personal files.  There's a file on 			you, but you may find it... 			disappointing.            DEEP SPACE: "Battle Lines" - 1/21/93 - TEASER            2.1    CONTINUED:					KIRA			I'm a big girl, Commander.	Sisko reluctantly places the data clip on his desk, then 	EXITS, quickly followed by Dax and O'Brien.2    INT. OPS - CONTINUOUS	Sisko, Dax and O'Brien assume their Ops stations alongside 	various N.D.s to await the fallout from Kira.					BASHIR'S COM VOICE			Bashir to Sisko!					SISKO			Sisko here.					BASHIR'S COM VOICE				(excited)			I'm at Airlock Fourteen, Commander.  			I think you'd better get down here.					SISKO			What's the problem, Doctor?					BASHIR'S COM VOICE			I was about to begin off-loading 			some medical specimens from the 			Bajoran transport... and... well... 			The Kai is here!					SISKO				(disbelieving)			Kai... Opaka?  Why would she be here?					BASHIR'S COM VOICE			She says you once offered her a tour 			of the station.	Sisko, O'Brien and Dax exchange surprised looks.  At that 	moment Kira bursts out of the Commander's Office, furious.					KIRA			"A minor operative whose activities 			are limited to running errands for 			the terrorist leaders."            DEEP SPACE: "Battle Lines" - 1/22/93 - TEASER            3.2    CONTINUED:					SISKO				(to Bashir)			Tell her I'll be right there.				(approaching Kira)			Major, when you're through feeling 			underappreciated, perhaps you'd join 			me in welcoming the Kai aboard.	Kira stares at Sisko, speechless.3    INT. PROMENADE AT BAJORAN TEMPLE	OPAKA and Kira emerge from the temple, followed by one Bajoran 	monk.  A beat later Sisko and BASHIR emerge.  ODO and a few 	strategically scattered BAJORAN DEPUTIES watch vigilantly 	from across the Promenade.4    BASHIR AND SISKO	They watch as Opaka moves along the Promenade, oblivious to 	the passersby who stare reverently or curiously at her.					BASHIR				(quietly)			You say she's never been here before?					SISKO			She's never even left Bajor before.					BASHIR			Excuse me for saying so, Commander, 			but she looks preoccupied.5    THE SECOND LEVEL - KIRA AND OPAKA	entering from the stairway... The Kai, strangely silent, 	drifts to a viewport, gazes out into open space.					KIRA				(all concern)			Is something wrong, Opaka?	Opaka is thoughtfully fingering a pendant she wears around 	her neck.  She takes Kira's hand.					OPAKA			... Contemplating prophecy.         DEEP SPACE: "Battle Lines" - REV. 1/25/93 - TEASER          4.5    CONTINUED:					KIRA			Interesting you chose this viewport.				(pointing)			The wormhole is just out there.	Sisko and Bashir step up behind them.					BASHIR			It's a spectacular sight to see.					SISKO			Unfortunately, it can only be seen 			when a ship enters it or exits, and 			nothing's scheduled for today.					OPAKA			A shame.	Opaka smiles inwardly.  She turns to Sisko and stares at him 	with anticipation.  After a beat...					SISKO				(tapping com badge)			Sisko to O'Brien.					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE			Go ahead Commander.					SISKO			Prepare the Yangtzee Kiang for launch, 			Chief.  Kira and I are taking the 			Kai through the wormhole.	Kira acknowledges her inclusion with a thankful nod.					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE			Right away, sir.	Sisko looks to Opaka for confirmation that he read her mind 	correctly.  She has an almost relieved expression.					OPAKA			Thank you.	Sisko notices Bashir staring plaintively at him.					SISKO			I didn't want to keep you from your 			duties, Doctor.					BASHIR			It's a slow day.            DEEP SPACE: "Battle Lines" - 1/22/93 - TEASER            5.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO				(beat)			All right.				(takes Opaka's arm)			This way --	He leads her away.  Kira and Bashir follow.6    INT. DOCKING AIRLOCK - ON DOORS OF YANGTZEE KIANG	O'Brien and a Bajoran crewmember emerge from the Runabout, 	wiping their hands and packing up a tool chest.  Sisko, Kira 	and Opaka approach, followed by Bashir.  Seeing the Kai, the 	Bajoran bows his head and O'Brien straightens up.					SISKO			Is the ship ready, Chief?					O'BRIEN			Prepped and ready for departure, 			Commander.				(to Opaka, sincerely)			Ma'am --					SISKO				(to Opaka)			After you.	Opaka and Sisko step toward the Runabout, but Opaka stops 	just short of entering.  She fingers the pendant around her 	neck, then looks up at O'Brien.					OPAKA			You have a child, don't you?					O'BRIEN			I do.  I have a little girl, ma'am.					OPAKA				(pleased)			Would you give her this for me.	Opaka removes the pendant and hands it to him, then enters 	the Runabout.  Baffled, O'Brien looks to Sisko for an answer 	but he has none.  He simply shrugs his shoulders and follows 	Kira and Bashir into the Runabout.  The doors shut as O'Brien 	walks away, gazing curiously at the pendant.            DEEP SPACE: "Battle Lines" - 1/21/93 - TEASER            6.7    EXT.

You honor us 			with your presence.					SISKO				(to com)			Yangtzee Kiang to DS Nine.  Estimating 			time of return, fourteen hundred 			hours.					DAX'S COM VOICE			Logged in...

Leaning 	forward, Bashir points out the window for her.					BASHIR			There's Idran, the closest system.  			It's a ternary star.	Oblivious, Opaka continues to gaze off into space silently.					OPAKA				(after a beat)			A doorway to the unknown...					SISKO			The other side of the galaxy, to be 			precise.  The Gamma quadrant is 			seventy thousand light years from 			Bajor.

You may return.	Sisko waits, hoping for a better answer, but none comes.					SISKO			Take us back to the wormhole, Major.					KIRA			Coming about...	But before she completes that, a short on-off pinging sound 	emanates from her console.  Kira studies a readout.           DEEP SPACE: "Battle Lines" - 1/22/93 - ACT ONE           10.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA			Sensors are picking up a narrow band 			subspace signal...					SISKO			What do you make of it?	Kira presses panels and studies a display closely.					KIRA			Just a long stream of statistical 			data followed by a request for 			response... but I'm not reading a 			reply.					SISKO			Launch a class two probe.

Strings of odd-shaped lights are crudely hung on 	the ceiling.	As Sisko, Kira and Bashir pass, the Ennis inhabiting the 	cave halt their mundane activities (sewing, cleaning weapons, 	eating) to stare at the strange aliens.  All of them wear 	tattered clothes.	They arrive before SHEL-LA, the Ennis leader, standing by a 	fire.  He is battle-scarred and tough-looking, but a great 	weariness surrounds him.  NIMA places the phasers and Bashir's 	medical kit by him.  Shel-la picks up a phaser and briefly 	examines it, stands to examine his new arrivals.					SHEL-LA			Our first visitors...				(stops before Kira)			You are not all the same race.					KIRA				(angry and in pain)			I am a Bajoran!            DEEP SPACE: "Battle Lines" 1/22/93 - ACT TWO            18.34   CONTINUED:					SISKO			I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.				(gesturing)			Major Kira Nerys and Doctor Julian 			Bashir.	Shel-la turns toward Bashir and laughs a grim laugh.					SHEL-LA			A doctor?

As I said, our home is on 			the other side of the galaxy.	Shel-la is relieved.  He resumes his position by the fire 	and studies the phaser.
