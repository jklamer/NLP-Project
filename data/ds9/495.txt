She's shaking her 	head as if something has happened that she can't quite 	believe. O'Brien studies the panel innards for a beat, 	then reaches to get a TOOL from his TOOLKIT.					O'BRIEN			Looks like he used some sort of 			encryption program to bypass the 			access protocols.					KIRA			Unbelievable... the nerve.	The DOOR OPENS and ODO escorts QUARK into the room. He 	sees the hard look on Kira's face and flashes his most 	ingratiating smile.					QUARK			You wanted to see me, Major?					ODO 			Don't pretend you don't know what 			this is about.	Quark shrugs that he doesn't.					KIRA			Maybe this'll jog your memory. 				(to computer)			Engage monitor.	The monitor engages, but instead of the familiar UFP 	insignia coming up, a MOVING GRAPHIC appears 	advertising Quark's, much like the one we've seen on 	monitors behind the bar itself. Quark's VOICE comes 	over the com-system, singing a JINGLE that might go 	something like this:        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					QUARK'S VOICE				(sing-song)			Come to Quark's, Quark's is fun, 			come right now, don't walk, run!	A beat later, the usual UFP insignia APPEARS. Quark, 	who's been mouthing along with obvious pride in his 	handiwork, smiles with pleasure.					QUARK			I love the part where my name 			rotates around...	He trails off when he sees the cold stares from our 	people...					ODO 			Tampering with the station's com-			system is a class-three offense.					QUARK			It's just a little advertisement.				(when this doesn't sway 				them)			I didn't put one up in Ops.					ODO 			I'm sure the magistrate will take 			that into consideration when he 			calculates your fine.	The DOOR OPENS and WORF ENTERS, looking particularly 	annoyed.

She turns to Quark, keeps her anger in 	check.					KIRA			If all your little 			"advertisements" aren't purged 			from our systems by the time I get 			back from the Gamma Quadrant... 				(a threat)			I will come to Quark's, and 			believe me, I will have fun.	And with that, she turns and EXITS.

RUINED CITY - DAY (OPTICAL/MATTE)	What might have once been a bustling modern city 	street. The few structures still standing are gutted, 	blackened and scorched by fire. Shanties and other 	makeshift structures are propped against them.	The inhabitants of the planet, dressed in tattered 	rags, can be seen milling about. They look human, but 	they all have BLUE, vein-like WELTS on their faces.	Some sit listlessly, with nothing to do. others are 	carrying water in makeshift containers, lugging 	firewood, tending fires burning in rusted-out 	cylindrical containers. A few push wheelbarrow like 	carts in front of them -- produce vendors, willing to 	barter their paltry merchandise.	There is no sign of power being generated anywhere, and 	the inhabitants use the now useless artifacts from 	their once-industrial civilization for other purposes -- 	what might have once been an alien refrigerator, 	for example, might now serve as part of someone's home.	A MAN passes by pulling a CART with three dead BODIES 	on it, partially covered by a tarp.	Our people react to the scene of devastation before 	them...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - TEASER       6A.12   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			What happened here?	Some of the inhabitants have noticed our people, and 	are eyeing them warily from the distance.	Suddenly a woman comes staggering out of a nearby 	structure. We will come to know her, if only briefly, 	as NORVA. Unlike the others, her welts are RED and 	inflamed, and her face is covered with them.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - TEASER        7.12   CONTINUED:	(2)	She's in obvious pain, is having difficulty walking, 	but manages to croak out a plea for help.					NORVA			Help me...	She collapses, and Bashir moves to assist her.

In the 	background, some of the inhabitants watch our people 	with a mix of curiosity and suspicion.	Dax returns, and oddly her hair is down, no longer 	pinned by a barrette.					BASHIR 			The painkiller I gave her isn't 			having much effect.				(giving her another				hypo)			These people's neurophysiology is			so different from ours, I doubt			this "blight" is any danger to us.	Dax nods an acknowledgment.					DAX				(gesturing)			I got us transportation to the 			hospital.	Bashir looks over and sees a WOMAN approaching them, 	pushing a CART.

These 			aren't the friendliest people I've 			ever met.	As if in reply, Dax tosses her head to show her hair is	unbound. Bashir looks, and the Woman has her scraggly 	hair partially kept by Dax's barrette. The Woman 	flashes a craggy grin, pleased with the trade and how 	she looks. Off this moment...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - ACT ONE        9.14   INT. HOSPITAL	as Bashir and Dax ENTER holding Norva.	For a moment, our people think they've come to the 	wrong place -- it looks more like a restaurant than a 	hospital. There are two groups of people in different 	parts of the room, each sitting on cushions around low 	tables.	Each group is centered around someone who appears to be 	the guest of honor. He or she is dressed in nicely 	kept CLOTHING; not new or flashy, just clean and not 	tattered. The discerning viewer might notice that the 	two guests of honor have RED markings on their faces, 	while everyone else has the more common blue markings.	The guest of honor is the only person at each table 	partaking of a meal; while not opulent by our 	standards, the food, the drink, the very setting 	itself, is strikingly luxurious for this bleak world.	The room is LIT by OIL LAMPS positioned here and there,	and in one corner an Attendant is cranking an alien 	PHONOGRAPH by hand.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - ACT ONE       10.14   CONTINUED:	It's been modified to work without power, and as the 	engraved cylinder rotates, the machine plays soft ALIEN 	MUSIC.					DAX			This is a hospital... ?	Before our people can figure out what's happening, an 	ATTENDANT approaches them. Like his colleagues he's 	wearing a robe over his street clothes, similar to a 	doctor's coat, but now tattered and no longer white. 	He zeroes in on Norva, sees her red markings.					ATTENDANT 			She's quickened...	He beckons two colleagues over.					ATTENDANT 			Take her to Trevean.	The two assistants start to carry her toward a door 	leading to a back room. The Attendant turns back to 	our people.					ATTENDANT 			You're offworlders.					DAX			Yes.					ATTENDANT 			Don't worry, we'll take care of 			her now.	He moves off.					DAX				(sotto)			I haven't seen a single person who 			doesn't have lesions on their 			face...	Bashir nods, indicates the two "guests of honor" in 	turn.					BASHIR			His look inflamed... so do that 			girl's over there --					DAX			Like the woman we brought in...	A moment as they ponder what it could mean...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - ACT ONE       11.14   CONTINUED:	(2)	A distinguished-looking man of about forty ENTERS from 	the door through which Norva was taken. He wears a 	"wallet" full of vials at his side, and is just closing 	it up when he enters. It's TREVEAN, and as soon as the	male PATIENT (red welts) at the nearest table sees him 	he calls out to him.					PATIENT 			Trevean...	Our people react as they realize this is the man Norva 	asked to see.	Trevean turns at the sound of his name -- it's clear 	from the faces of everyone in the room that he is a 	respected, almost revered figure. The patient, who is 	not in any way debilitated by his condition, raises a 	goblet to toast him.					PATIENT 			Thank you...				(motioning around him)			For this.					TREVEAN			You deserve nothing less...	He says this with a simple kindness that speaks to a 	genuine generosity of spirit.					PATIENT				(to all)			Yesterday morning when I awoke, I 			saw that it had finally 			happened... I'd quickened. I 			always thought I'd be afraid...				(smiles)			But I wasn't. Because I knew I 			could come here.				(with emotion)			Last night I slept in a bed for 			the first time in my life.				indicating the phonograph)			I fell asleep listening to music.	There is an almost audible sigh from the gathered 	group, as if they can scarcely imagine the luxury.					PATIENT 			This morning I bathed in hot 			water...

Everyone smiles as he does this except a young 	woman at the table who we'll come to know as EKORIA. 	She's trying not to show how upset she is.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - ACT ONE       12.14   CONTINUED:	(4)	When the patient finishes and sits down, the people at 	his table move to hug him one by one.	Trevean turns away and approaches our people...					TREVEAN 			You're the strangers who brought 			Norva here...					DAX				(nodding)			How is she?					TREVEAN 			It was too late for her.	Our people react to this sad news...					TREVEAN 			If only she'd come sooner, I 			could've helped her.					BASHIR 			Then there is a treatment for the 			Blight?	Trevean is almost surprised by the question.					TREVEAN 			There is no cure. It's always 			fatal.					BASHIR 			I don't understand -- you just 			said you could've helped her.	Trevean takes a breath, considers for a beat.					TREVEAN 			Why are you here?					DAX			We received a distress call, we're 			here to help in any way we can.					BASHIR			I'm a doctor.	Trevean reacts to the word, nods thoughtfully.					BASHIR 			I have access to sophisticated 			diagnostic equipment.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - ACT ONE      12A.14   CONTINUED:	(5)	Trevean holds up a hand to stop him, impatient with 	where this is going.					TREVEAN			We had sophisticated equipment			once. Do you think our world was			always like this? Two centuries			ago, we were much like you. We			built great cities, traveled to			neighboring worlds...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Quickening" - 03/19/96 - ACT ONE       13.14   CONTINUED:	(6)					TREVEAN (Cont'd)			We believed nothing was beyond our 			ability. We even thought we could 			resist the Dominion.	Our people react.					TREVEAN			I see you've heard of them.				(beat)			Then take care not to defy them... 			or your people will pay the same 			price we did. The Jem'Hadar 			came... and left our world 			crushed, as an example to others.	Dax and Bashir exchange an uncomfortable look; the 	potential parallels to the Federation are ominous. 	Trevean motions to the Attendant.					TREVEAN			Bring Milani's child to me.				(turning to our people)			More than anything, the Dominion 			wanted my people to bear the mark 			of their defiance. And so they 			gave us the Blight.	Trevean holds the BABY out for us to see... it has the 	same blue welts on its face as everyone else. It's a 	tragic sight, a symbol of hopelessness.					TREVEAN 			We're all born with it... and we 			all die from it. The Blight 			quickens... the lesions turn 			red... and death comes soon 			after...

Families live in 	areas no bigger than closets; CRATES and other scraps 	of wood and metal serve as makeshift tables and chairs. 	There's no running water, few windows, and the only 	LIGHT comes from oil lamps. Still, despite the 	poverty, the place is relatively clean and well-kept. 	There are even a few flowers here and there. We HEAR 	the constant background din of people talking, children 	squalling, etc.	Ekoria leads Dax and Bashir through the maze of 	partitions; they're carrying cargo containers full of 	MEDICAL SUPPLIES. They stack them with other supplies 	they've carried in and put in Ekoria's living area, a 	small room demarcated by curtains. There's a crude 	mattress in one corner, a makeshift table and stools. 	There are even attempts at decoration.

It looks like it was done with homemade 	paint; the colors are a little faded and inconsistent, 	but even so, it's quite nice. It depicts what the city 	we've seen might have looked like before the 	destruction -- the buildings are graceful, trees line 	the streets, and the people are well dressed.					DAX			Did you do this?					EKORIA 			My husband did.
