JAKE SISKO'S HOUSE - NIGHT (DISTANT FUTURE)	It is the early twenty-fifth century, some seventy 	years later than the time our series ordinarily takes 	place.	The house is isolated, set off in swampy Louisiana 	bayou country. It's a two-story modern design that 	harks back to Southern architectural traditions; it has 	a cluttered feel, stacks of BOOKS and papers -- the 	home of a man who lives alone...	There's a writing DESK against one wall, an antique 	grandfather CLOCK with a pendulum that clicks quietly, 	a pair of comfortable armchairs around a low table, a 	fireplace with a mantle. On the walls are hung several 	PAINTINGS: mostly impressionistic landscapes, some 	depicting the surrounding bayous. RAIN beats softly 	against the windows, and occasionally distant lightning 	can be seen through them.2    CLOSE ON JAKE SISKO	now in his SEVENTIES, healthy and fit for a man his 	age.	He looks around the room, taking in his surroundings 	with a pensive look. He approaches the mantle, begins 	to study the objects propped there, his hands moving 	somewhat unsteadily to touch each in turn. We 	recognize some of them as Benjamin Sisko's personal 	effects: the clock from his office, a YORUBA MASK; 	a scuffed BASEBALL on a pedestal; a BLUEPRINT of an 	ancient Bajoran spacecraft with solar sails and, next 	to it, a framed PHOTO showing a seventeen-year-old Jake 	and his father.	A small smile plays on Old Jake's features as he takes 	in these artifacts of his life... a smile that is at 	once melancholy and yet somehow hopeful.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/22/95 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:	He turns away, moves to a nearby table, and picks up an 	advanced looking HYPOSPRAY.	Very deliberately, he reaches up and injects himself in 	the neck.	He sets the hypospray down, moves to take a seat in a 	nearby armchair. But he's interrupted by a door CHIME.	Surprised, he glances at the clock to check the time -- 	it's around 9:00 PM. He walks toward the door and 	looks through its window to see who's outside.	It's a young human woman in her twenties, MELANIE. She 	might best be described as "bookish"; she's carrying a 	shoulder bag, and her clothes and hair are wet from the 	rain. She's standing on the doorstep with an expectant 	and somewhat nervous look on her face. Old Jake 	studies her for a beat, then opens the door. When she 	sees him, her eyes go wide, as if she's just laid eyes 	on a celebrity of some sort.					OLD JAKE 			May I help you? You might as well 			come in.	She does her best to swallow back her nervousness.					MELANIE 			I'm sorry to bother you, it's just 			that...				(at a loss) 			I... I've been...	Jake notices a small scrape on her forehead.					OLD JAKE				(with concern) 			You're hurt.	She reaches up to touch her forehead.					MELANIE 			I must've scraped myself on a branch.					OLD JAKE				(gently chiding) 			That's what happens when you go 			tromping around the bayous in the 			middle of the night.	She nods and smiles; more than grateful, she seems 	thrilled at being invited inside.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/08/95 - TEASER       3.2  CONTINUED:	(2)	He stands aside, and she crosses into the room. Her 	eyes take it in hungrily, as if she were a pilgrim who 	finally made it to some sacred shrine. He closes the 	door, crosses toward a chest of drawers.					OLD JAKE 			Go warm up by the fire. I have a 			first aid kit around here 			somewhere...				(looking around) 			Now where is it... ?	As he looks for the first aid kit she sits in a chair 	and continues to drink in the room around her.					OLD JAKE 			So... what are you doing out here, 			anyway?	She considers before answering.					MELANIE			I'm a writer...				(correcting herself) 			-- at least, I want to be.				(decides to come out 				with it) 			And the truth is... I was looking 			for you...	Old Jake turns and looks at her with surprise.					OLD JAKE 			Oh?					MELANIE 			You are Jake Sisko... the writer?	Jake's surprise at her question gives him away.					MELANIE 			I can't believe I'm really here. 			Talking to you. You're my 			favorite author... of all time.	Jake looks up from the first aid kit and chuckles 	softly to himself.					OLD JAKE				(wry) 			You should read more...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/08/95 - TEASER       4.2    CONTINUED:	(4)					MELANIE				(with emotion) 			I mean it. Your books... they're 			so insightful...					OLD JAKE				(simply) 	I'm glad you like them.	With the cellular regenerator in hand, Jake bends to 	peer at her wound. He passes the regenerator over her 	scrape, and when we next see her face, the scrape is 	gone.					OLD JAKE 			There. Good as new.					MELANIE 			Thank you.	Old Jake pulls a throw off a nearby chair, hands it to 	the still-chilled Melanie. He then moves toward the 	replicator to start to put together a tray of tea and 	biscuts.					OLD JAKE  			I didn't realize people still read  			my books.					MELANIE  			Of course they do. A friend  			recommended Anslem to me and I  			read it straight through, twice in  			one night.					OLD JAKE				(bemused)			Twice in one night... ?					MELANIE  			It made me want to read everything  			you'd ever written, but when I  			looked, all I could find were your  			"Collected Stories." I couldn't  			believe it.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/22/95 TEASER        5.2    CONTINUED:	(5)					MELANIE (Cont'd)  			I'd finally found someone whose  			writing I really admired, and he'd  			only published two books.	Jake smiles wryly.					OLD JAKE  			Not much to show for a life's  			work, is it? I'm going to get us  			some tea.					MELANIE  			I savored those stories, read them  			slowly, one each day. And when I  			was finished, I wished I hadn't  			read them at all.	Jake looks at her quizzically. Melanie realizes how  	that must have sounded and quickly explains herself.					MELANIE  			So that I could read them again...  			like it was the first time.	Jake smiles, nods that he understands. As he sits down 	with the tray...					OLD JAKE  			There's only one "first time" for  			everything, isn't there? 				(considers)  			And only one last time, too. You  			think about that when you get to  			be my age. That today might be  			the last time you... sit in a  			favorite chair... watch the rain  			fall... enjoy a cup of tea.	Melanie looks at him, then cautiously asks the question 	that brought her here.					MELANIE 				(softly)  			Can I ask you something... ?	He nods that she go ahead...					MELANIE  			Why did you stop writing?	He looks at her for a moment.       DEEP-SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/15/95 - TEASER       6.2    CONTINUED:	(6)					OLD JAKE				(shrugs)  			I lost my favorite pen... just  			couldn't seem to get any work done  			without it.	For a brief moment, Melanie actually takes him 	seriously, then...					MELANIE 			You're joking.	Jake smiles, and she looks down for a beat, a bit 	embarrassed to have fallen for it.					MELANIE 			You weren't even forty when you  			stopped writing... I've never  			understood why you gave it up.	Old Jake takes this in, lets out a long breath...					OLD JAKE			It's a long story...					MELANIE			I have time.				(gently pleading)  			Tell me. Please.	Jake takes a breath, and for a moment we think he's 	going to decline, but then a smile spreads on his face, 	the smile of a man who's suddenly been struck by 	something he finds ironic.					OLD JAKE			If you'd shown up yesterday, or 			last week... I'd have said no and 			sent you on your way. But here 			you are, today of all days. 			Somehow... it seems like the right 			time for me to finally tell this 			story...	She breaks into a grin, leans in, all attention.					OLD JAKE			It begins many years ago... when 			I was eighteen... and the worst 			thing that could happen to a young 			man happened to me... my father 			died...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/04/95 - TEASER      6A.2    CONTINUED:	(6)	Off Melanie's reaction we...3    thru   OMITTED4    									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/10/95 - ACT ONE       7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)5    INT. JAKE'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) (DISTANT FUTURE)	Old Jake is thoughtful for a beat as he remembers.					OLD JAKE 			We were very close, my father and 			I. Partly because we'd lost my 			mother five years earlier...					MELANIE 			I know.				(off his look) 			I read a biography about you.	Jake nods and smiles ruefully.					MELANIE				(continuing) 			It said you stopped writing so you 			could conduct scientific 			research... ?					OLD JAKE			It's not... quite that simple...	He sighs, considers how best to explain.					OLD JAKE 			You see, right before my father 			died, I was working on a short 			story. I don't remember what it 			was about... but I do know that I 			was taking it very seriously. I 			worked on it night and day for 			weeks... but I couldn't seem to 			make any headway, and it was 			making me miserable.									DISSOLVE TO:6    INT.  DEEP SPACE NINE - JAKE'S BEDROOM (PRESENT)	Jake continues in V.O. and we see his younger self 	sitting on his bed working on an oversized PADD. The 	scene is silent except for Old Jake's voice.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/10/95 - ACT ONE       8.6    CONTINUED:					OLD JAKE'S (V.O.) 				(continuing) 			I suppose my father thought I 			needed to take a break, because he 			insisted I come to the Gamma 			Quadrant with him to watch the 			wormhole undergo what they call a 			subspace inversion...	In the middle of the V.O., SISKO pops his head in and 	mouth's a "let's go" to Jake. Jake stands, and without 	taking his eyes of the PADD, follows.7    EXT. SPACE - THE DEFIANT (OPTICAL) (PRESENT)	Hanging in space near the open mouth of the Wormhole.					OLD JAKE'S (V.O.) 			Of course what he didn't realize 			was that I could hide away on the 			Defiant just as easily as I 			could on the station...8    INT. DEFIANT - JAKE'S QUARTERS (PRESENT)	where he's sitting on the upper bunk working on his 	PADD. The door CHIMES.					JAKE 			Yeah.	The door OPENS and Sisko sticks his head in.					SISKO			Come on, Jake. This only happens 			once every fifty years. You'll 			never forgive yourself if you miss 			it.  					JAKE 			I'll be right there.					SISKO			You said that ten minutes ago.					JAKE 			I just want to get this paragraph 			right.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/10/95 - ACT ONE       9.8    CONTINUED:	Sisko realizes Jake is still at it and ENTERS the room 	to talk to him.					SISKO				(with concern) 			I thought you were going to put 			that aside for a while.					JAKE 			I tried, but it's all I can think 			about.	Sisko folds his arms on the upper bunk where Jake's 	lying.					SISKO 			I'm no writer, but if I were, it 			seems to me that I'd want to poke 			my head up once in a while and 			take a look around... see what's 			going on.				(smiles) 			It's life, Jake; you can miss it 			if you don't open your eyes.	Sisko smiles, and Jake nods almost imperceptibly.					SISKO				(continuing) 			What do you say we go up to the 			bridge, watch the wormhole do its 			thing, then I'll read what you've 			got and we can talk about it.				(beat) 			Deal?					JAKE 			Deal.	He holds out his hand and Jake, smiling sheepishly, 	takes it and lets Sisko pull him off the bed. Suddenly 	the ship LURCHES violently. Red Alert lights come on 	and the floor seems to tilt. Sisko smacks his 	combadge.					SISKO 			Sisko to Bridge. What happened?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/04/95 - ACT ONE      10.8A   INT.

JAKE'S QUARTERS					SISKO 			Pull us back to a safe distance.					DAX'S COM VOICE				(urgent) 			I'm on it, Benjamin. But we've 			got another problem.

DEFIANT - ENGINEERING (OPTICAL) (PRESENT)	as Jake ENTERS to find a scene of chaos.	TWO N.D. Engineers are out cold on the floor, Sisko is 	kneeling to check on them.	There are damaged panels, and smoke curls through air, 	which is cut by the blaring sound of a warning KLAXON. 	The warp core is FRITZING ominously.					SISKO				(to com) 			Sisko to Sickbay, I need a medical 			team down here right away.					DAX'S COM VOICE 			Dax to Sisko, the warp coils are 			locked into a feedback loop... 			You've got to realign them or the 			core's going to blow...					SISKO 			I'm on it.	Sisko starts to move off... and sees Jake in the 	doorway. For a moment we think he's going to tell him 	to leave, but instead:					SISKO 			Jake, get me an interphasic 			compensator.	Jake nods, moves toward a TOOLKIT that's knocked open 	on the floor, various tools spilled out of it. Sisko 	rushes toward a panel on the opposite wall, rips off 	the cover, and starts working. Jake is soon at his 	father's side, scrounging inside the toolkit for the 	correct device.					COMPUTER VOICE 			Warning. Warp core breach in 			fifty seconds.					SISKO				(to com) 			Dax, you'd better stand by to 			eject the core.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/04/95 - ACT ONE     11A.12   CONTINUED:					DAX'S COM VOICE 			We can't.

Warp core breach in 			thirty seconds.	Desperate, Jake looks up toward where the toolkit was 	spilled open... his eye catches a glint of metal -- the 	compensator, on the floor, partially hidden by a 	console. He rushes toward it, snatches it up, then 	rushes back to give the tool to Sisko.	Sisko immediately sets to work with it on the open 	panel.					SISKO 			I'm going to try shunting the 			excess power out through the 			deflector array.	A beat, and then behind them, the warp core starts to 	wind down.					SISKO				(working)			Just a little more...	And after a moment, the engine systems seem to slow to 	their normal state...					SISKO 			There...	Sisko allows himself a smile, then reaches to hand Jake 	the compensator... but before either of them has 	complete possession of it, the warp core unexpectedly 	spits off a BOLT OF BLUE ENERGY that arcs across the 	room and zaps Sisko squarely in the back.	His body goes rigid, as if he's been speared, and a 	brief CRACKLE of energy snakes from his body, across 	the compensator, and into Jake's body. Jake is thrown 	back by the discharge, as if by an electric shock, and 	falls to the floor.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Visitor" - REV. 08/22/95 - ACT ONE      13.12   CONTINUED:	(3)	As Jake watches in horror, portions of Sisko's body 	start to FLICKER and PHASE OUT, until finally he 	completely DEMATERIALIZES.					JAKE 			No!	And the tool falls to a clatter on the deck...13   INT. JAKE'S HOUSE (DISTANT FUTURE) 	Where the old Jake sits quietly, his eyes moist. 	Melanie is clearly shaken by the events Jake described.					OLD JAKE			He was gone...	Melanie looks down...					MELANIE 				(softly) 			I'm not sure I could ever get over 			losing someone like that, right in 			front of my eyes...					OLD JAKE 			People do. Time passes, they 			realize that the person they lost 			is really gone... and they heal.					MELANIE			Is that what happened to you?					OLD JAKE 			No...
