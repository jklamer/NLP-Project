	FADE IN:

1    WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK:

	On Stardate 43997, Captain Jean-
	Luc Picard of the Federation 
	Starship Enterprise was kidnapped 
	for six days by an invading force 
	known as the Borg.  Surgically 
	altered, he was forced to lead 
	an assault on Starfleet at WOLF
	359


										FADE TO BLACK.

	AFTER A BEAT:

					PICARD/LOCUTUS (V.O.)
			You will be assimilated.
			Resistance is futile.

	HARD CUT TO:

2    CLOSE UP OF LOCUTUS (VIEWSCREEN) (OPTICAL)

					PICARD/LOCUTUS
			You will disarm all weapons and escort 
			us to sector zero zero one.

	If you attempt to intervene, we will destroy you.

3    REVERSE ANGLE - INT. BRIDGE - THE SARATOGA (OPTICAL)

	A Battle Bridge... a male Vulcan Captain, a burly male Bolian 
	tactical officer (Lieutenant rank), female humans at Con and 
	Ops (Ensign rank)... our primary attention is on Lieutenant 
	Commander BENJAMIN SISKO, the first officer, a rugged, 
	charismatic man in his late thirties... they react to the 
	viewscreen pronouncement... Sisko is monitoring signals on a 
	panel...

					SISKO
			Sir, Admiral Hanson has deployed the 
			Gage, the Kyushu and the Melbourne...


         DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/12/92 - TEASER         2.

3    CONTINUED:

					CAPTAIN
			Move us to position alpha, Ensign...

					CON OFFICER
			Aye, sir...

					CAPTAIN
			Load all torpedo bays... ready 
			phasers...

4    EXT. SPACE - THE SARATOGA (OPTICAL)

	fires phasers and photons as the Borg ship sends out a cutting 
	beam at the Melbourne... when the Melbourne's shields fail, 
	there is a massive explosion.  The Borg ship immediately 
	turns its attention to the Saratoga... sending out another 
	tractor beam...

5    INT. SARATOGA - BRIDGE

	A shake...

					TACTICAL OFFICER
			The Borg are attempting to lock on 
			to us...

					CAPTAIN
			Evasive maneuvers... delta pattern...

5A   EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SHIP  (OPTICAL)

	LOCKS ON TO THE SARATOGA

5B   INT. SARATOGA - BRIDGE

					CON OFFICER
			Delta pattern initiated...

					OPS OFFICER
				(interrupting)
			They've locked on...

6    EXT. SPACE - THE SARATOGA (OPTICAL)

	caught in the Borg tractor beam... two more Starfleet ships 
	come to the rescue... fire several rounds at the Borg without 
	success...

7    INT. BORG SHIP - LOCUTUS - (OPTICAL)

	watches the battle on a viewscreen with dispassion...

8    INT. SARATOGA BRIDGE

	As before...

					OPS OFFICER
			Our shields are being drained...  
			sixty-four percent... forty-two...

					CAPTAIN
			Recalibrate shield nutation...

					TACTICAL
			Modulation is having no effect...

					OPS OFFICER
			Shields have failed.

					CAPTAIN
			Full reverse... maintain...

	He is interrupted by a huge explosion on the Bridge...  that 
	obliterates our view... and when it clears there is smoke 
	and fire... and massive damage... the forward consoles are 
	spitting sparks... emergency lights come on... Sisko has 
	been thrown to the floor, his forehead is cut... he tries to 
	regain his bearings...

					SISKO
			Damage report...

	No answer...

					SISKO
			Damage report... 

	The tactical officer is the only other one alive in the room 
	and he's hurt worse than Sisko... he struggles to his feet 
	to read his console...

					TACTICAL OFFICER
			Direct hit... decks one through 
			four...

	Sisko has checked the dead Captain and other officers...


         DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - TEASER         4.

8    CONTINUED:

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Warning.  Damage to warp core.
			Containment failure in four 
			minutes...

	The Tactical Officer is still trying to make something on 
	his console work...

					SISKO
			Let's get the civilians to the escape 
			pods, Lieutenant...

	The Tactical Officer acknowledges, follows Sisko out...

9    INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

	engulfed in fire... yelling and cries in the background... 
	stabilizers are failing, and everything is leaning left just 
	a little bit... we find a Turbolift door opening and Sisko 
	and the Tactical Officer come out... react to the sight... 
	they fight their way through the fire... find some injured 
	civilians, trying to gather personal possessions in their 
	arms to take with them... Sisko is alert, professional...

					SISKO
			Leave everything... Go to your 
			assigned evacuation area now.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Warning.  Damage to warp core.
			Containment failure in three 
			minutes...

	He reacts as they come to a wounded woman struggling to get 
	down the hallway...


         DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - TEASER         5.

9    CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Doran...

	She leans exhausted into him... the Tactical officer lifts 
	her...

					TACTICAL OFFICER
			I'll take care of her... go on...

					SISKO
				(to the woman)
			Have you seen Jennifer...

	She looks at Sisko with mournful eyes... and his heart jumps 
	into his throat... he moves down the hallway with more 
	focus... comes to a door that is jammed open...  smoke is 
	billowing out...

10   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS  (OPTICAL)

	Destroyed... an explosion has ripped a hole in the floor... 
	fire and smoke is streaking up through it...
	outside the window we can see evidence that the battle with 
	the Borg ship is continuing... Sisko enters, sees his wife 
	buried in rubble... He urgently pulls things away to get to 
	her... he uncovers the upper part of her body... beside her 
	is an unconscious nine year old boy...

					SISKO
				(calm, controlled)
			It's gonna be okay... I'll get you 
			out of there... you're gonna be 
			okay...

	But he can't lift the wreckage that has crushed her lower 
	half... his calm demeanor is betrayed by...


         DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/31/92 - TEASER         6.

11   HIS HANDS

	desperately trying to lift heavy debris...

12   RESUME

	as he ignores the pain... but fails to make any headway, so 
	he returns to the front and tries to pull the boy free... 
	he's small enough to be eased out...  he moves slightly, 
	barely conscious, but not hurt critically...

					SISKO
			Okay, Jake... we'll just get your 
			Mom now and get outta here...

	Jake is still very groggy, doesn't respond...

13   ANGLE

	the tactical officer ENTERS...

					TACTICAL OFFICER
				(let's go)
			Commander...

					SISKO
			Help me...

	The officer moves in... examines Jennifer's lifeless body 
	with his tricorder... quickly determines she's dead...

					TACTICAL OFFICER
			Sir, we have to get to the...

	He stops, reacting as he sees --

14   SISKO'S HANDS

	incredibly bloody and burned...

15   SISKO

	glances numbly at the hands...

					SISKO
			Just help me get her free...


         DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - TEASER         7.

16   RESUME

	as the Tactical Officer picks up the boy...

					TACTICAL OFFICER
			She's gone.  There's nothing we can 
			do...

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Warning.  Damage to warp core.
			Containment failure in two 
			minutes...

	Sisko shakes his head... takes her hand in his...

					SISKO
			You go ahead, Lieutenant.  Take the 
			boy.

	His voice is calm and reassuring and another man might leave 
	him behind... but as a security man sticks his head in the 
	door, making one last check through the quarters, the tactical 
	officer hands off the boy to him and firmly pulls Sisko to 
	his feet...

					TACTICAL OFFICER
			Now, sir...

	His calm is undermined by the force he uses to resist the 
	tactical officer's attempts to pull him out... the officer 
	needs all of his Bolian strength to force his commanding 
	officer to leave... Sisko is without emotion, tight... he 
	feels no pain from his hands...  and yet he holds them up 
	above the elbow level like a beggar...

					SISKO
			Dammit... we can't leave her here...

	And they're out...


         DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/12/92 - TEASER         8.

17   INT. ESCAPE POD (OPTICAL)

	as the tactical officer leads in Sisko... where the security 
	officer is seated holding Jake... along with a dozen others 
	in cramped lifeboat fashion.

	The tactical officer presses panels... the door slides shut 
	and then without ever cutting outside, there is a woosh and 
	a shake and in the window, we see the Saratoga as our pod 
	shoots away from it... and Ben Sisko never takes his eyes 
	off it... and we may see other pods as we get further away... 
	and other wreckage of broken ships... and notice the flashes 
	of lightning from continued warfare with the Borg not far 
	away...  but we stay inside the pod... and then the Saratoga 
	explodes... and the light fills Ben's face...

	And move to find twelve year old JAKE SISKO holding a fishing 
	pole, sitting on a rock... and we're

20   EXT. FISHING POND - DAY (OPTICAL)

	Jake's trousers are rolled up to the knees, his bare feet 
	dangling in the water, his shirt unbuttoned...  he turns to 
	the sound of the voice... and a moment later, Sisko appears, 
	dressed in his Starfleet uniform, a full Commander now... he 
	smiles at the vision before him...

					SISKO
			There you are...

	The boy gives him a reluctant grin.  Sisko comes over, sits 
	beside him on the rock...

					SISKO
			How they biting?

					JAKE
			Small fries.  Threw 'em back.
			You want to go for a swim?

					SISKO
			Don't have time.  We've got to get 
			ready.

	Jake frowns.  Sisko notices.

					SISKO
			It won't be so bad.  I've heard Bajor 
			is a beautiful world...

					JAKE
			So why can't we live on the planet 
			instead of some old space station?

					SISKO
			Well, it's what Starfleet decided...

					JAKE
			You promised we'd stay on shore duty.

					SISKO
				(defensive)
			The station is in orbit of Bajor, 
			Jake.  It'll be just like shore duty.

					JAKE
			Will there be kids there?

					SISKO
			Absolutely.  Lots of kids.

	Sisko hopes he's telling the truth.

					FEMALE COM VOICE
			Bridge to Sisko.

					SISKO
			Yes, Captain...

					FEMALE COM VOICE
			We're approaching Deep Space Nine, 
			Commander.  We'll be docking in seven 
			minutes.

					SISKO
			Acknowledged.
				(puts his arm around 
				Jake)
			C'mon, we'll take the pond with us.

	The boy is not happy and doesn't give his father the 
	satisfaction of a smile.

	And the yellow grid of the Holodeck walls replace the woodsy 
	setting... and as Jake carries his incongruous fishing pole...

21   INT. CORRIDOR (NOT THE ENTERPRISE) (OPTICAL)

	They exit the Holodeck, Jake carrying the pole over his 
	shoulder... and as they come to an observation window... 
	they pause as they see outside...

					JAKE
			Is that it?

	Sisko acknowledges with a nod... and we move with them to 
	see what they see -- the strange, intriguing shape of the 
	alien space station designated Deep Space Nine by Starfleet...

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

22   EXT. SPACE - DS9 (OPTICAL)

	Establishing.  In this angle, we can see the Enterprise and 
	a few other ships are docked.

					SISKO (V.O.)
			Commence station log, Deep Space 
			Nine, Commander Benjamin Sisko, 
			Stardate xxxxx.x.  At the request of 
			the Bajoran provisional government, 
			Starfleet has agreed to establish a 
			Federation presence in this system 
			following the withdrawal of Cardassian 
			occupational forces.

23   INT. AIRLOCK - CLOSE ON MILES O'BRIEN

	his face straining with physical exertion...  sweating... 
	pulling back to find him working inside an open panel manually 
	working the levers and gears...  this is not Starfleet 
	technology by any means... as he struggles, the airlock slowly 
	opens to reveal Sisko and Jake standing there... they ENTER...

					O'BRIEN
			Sorry about that, Commander...  all 
			the interlock servos in this airlock 
			were stripped by the Cardassians...

	He sticks out his hand to shake then realizes that it is 
	covered with sludge from the panel he was just in and pulls 
	it back...

					O'BRIEN
			Miles O'Brien, your chief operations 
			officer...

	Sisko is cordial... but throughout the first three acts, 
	there is a grudging subtext... he's doing his duty but he 
	doesn't want to be here.

					SISKO
			We would've transported aboard if 
			we'd known you were having problems, 
			Chief...

	A Bajoran supernumerary manually closes the door behind them 
	as O'Brien leads them down the corridor...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT ONE        12.

23   CONTINUED:


					O'BRIEN
			That wouldn't have been possible 
			either, sir.  We've got some stray 
			nucleonic emissions that have to be 
			tracked down before we can safely 
			reinstate transporter operations.  
			It's a junkyard the bloody Cardies 
			left us with, if you ask me...

	They EXIT and...

24   INT. PROMENADE

	As they enter from the Airlock Gate... they react with shock 
	to what they see...  and we move with them to reveal our 
	first look at this extraordinary setting....

	The striking Cardassian/Bajoran architecture is mysterious 
	and impressive... and we can see how exciting a locale this 
	could once have been.  But now it is almost deserted... and 
	it has been ravaged by vandals... storefronts have been broken 
	out...  trash and broken stock from the stores litter the 
	thoroughfare... phaser blasts have burned scars on the 
	walls... a statue has been toppled...

25   SISKO

	reacts... his jaw tight... this is worse than he could have 
	possibly imagined...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/12/92 - ACT ONE        13.

26   MOVING WITH THEM

	along the devastation... in one store, a Bajoran woman 
	cleaning the mess glances up at them as they pass...  they 
	go by an outdoor cafe where only one despondent man is having 
	a drink...

					O'BRIEN
			I'm told the Cardassians decided to 
			have some fun the day they left... 
			four Bajorans were killed trying to 
			protect their shops...

	They pass by the Bar... looking inside, they can see QUARK, 
	the Ferengi proprietor and a couple Ferengi AIDES are packing 
	up gambling and bar equipment...

					SISKO
				(tight)
			Why hasn't anybody cleaned this up...

					O'BRIEN
			We've got all available personnel 
			assigned to repairing primary systems, 
			sir... the Cardassians took every 
			component of value, we have virtually 
			no defenses...

	I discussed it with Major Kira, the attache assigned here by 
	the Bajoran government and we decided...

					SISKO
			Understood.  But what about the 
			civilians who operated these shops... ?

					O'BRIEN
			A lot of them lost everything...

	a few are trying to rebuild, but most are packing up to 
	leave...

27   ANGLE

	to see ahead of them a Bajoran Monastery badly damaged by 
	vandals, but repairs are clearly underway... and as they 
	approach a strange old MONK (male) appears at the doorway... 
	his eyes lock onto Sisko's as they approach... it's an eerie 
	moment...

28   AT THE MONASTERY

					MONK #1
			Welcome, Commander.  Please enter.

	The prophets await you.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/12/92 - ACT ONE        14.

28   CONTINUED:

	Beat.  Sisko feels uncomfortable with the Monk's stare...

					SISKO
			Another time, perhaps.

	They move on... And the camera lingers as the Monk's gaze 
	follows him a mysterious beat...

					MONK #1
				(beat)
			Another time.

29   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	As they ENTER... it is dark and grim with a huge outrageous 
	looking Cardassian master bed.  The room doesn't raise Sisko's 
	spirits... O'Brien notices...

					O'BRIEN
			When my wife, Keiko, saw our quarters, 
			she started talking about visiting 
			her mother in Kumomoto...

	Sisko examines the strange bed... as Jake goes and looks 
	into an adjoining bedroom... O'Brien takes the
	opportunity alone with Sisko to say quietly --

					O'BRIEN
			Sir, I wouldn't allow the boy to go 
			roaming... we're still having some 
			security problems...

					JAKE (O.S.)
			Dad... !

	Appearing at the door...

					JAKE
			There's nothing to sleep on in here 
			except a cushion on the floor!

					O'BRIEN
			We can get you a real bunk off the 
			Enterprise...
				(to Sisko)
			Oh, and I almost forgot, Captain 
			Picard wants to see you as soon as 
			possible.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/14/92 - ACT ONE        15.

29   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(eyes off O'Brien, a 
				throwaway)
			He does...

	O'Brien wouldn't notice an attitude, but we do because we 
	know of Sisko's experience with Locutus... a beat, as Sisko 
	deliberately ignores the urgency of the request...

					SISKO
			Any word on our science and medical 
			officers?

					O'BRIEN
			They're expected tomorrow.

	Sisko acknowledges.

					SISKO
			Jake, I want you to stay here until 
			I come back...

					JAKE
			Is this the food replicator?

					O'BRIEN
				(pained)
			I'm afraid they're all off-line...  
			there's plenty of emergency rations... 
			I could send some down...

					JAKE
				(I hate this place)
			Dad...

					SISKO
			We're just gonna have to rough it 
			til we get things up and running, 
			Jake... okay?

					JAKE
				(not okay)
			Okay.

					SISKO
				(this isn't going to 
				work, but I'll try 
				to make it look that 
				I really think it 
				will, smiles)
			Okay.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/17/92 - ACT ONE        16.

29   CONTINUED:	(2)

	He looks at O'Brien and they EXIT.  Jake frowns...

30   INT. OPS

	Sisko and O'Brien ENTER from a Turbolift... the multi-tiered 
	facility lined with computer and life-support systems, 
	tactical controls, a master communications panel and 
	transporter pad.  It is in disarray... panels are open... 
	noticeable gaps appear where machinery has been removed... 
	conduits hang out of panels... several Bajorans and a couple 
	of Starfleet supernumeraries are busily working on various 
	repairs... A beat as they move deeper inside, Sisko looking 
	around...

					O'BRIEN
			I'd like to ask the designer what he 
			was thinking about when they built 
			this place... I still haven't been 
			able to find an O-D-N access... that's 
			the Prefect's office up there...

	Sisko looks up...

31   ANGLE

	The office is on the mezzanine with a balcony like Mussolini 
	might have designed for himself... Sisko shakes his head...

					SISKO
			So all others have to look up with 
			respect.  Cardassian architecture.

					O'BRIEN
			Yessir.
				(awkward)
			Major Kira has been using it...

	They exchange a look.  Sisko starts to move toward the 
	office...

					SISKO
			Is it my imagination or is it 
			unusually warm... ?

					O'BRIEN
			The environmental controls in Ops 
			are stuck at thirty-two "C"...  we're 
			working on it.

	As they reach the office...

					SISKO
			I guess it's time to meet Major 
			Kira...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT ONE        17.

31   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Sir, have you ever served with any 
			Bajoran women?

					SISKO
			No.  Why?

					O'BRIEN
				(I warned you)
			Just wondering, sir.

	Sisko nods... and walks up the stairs to his office...  as 
	he reaches the door which is open... he can hear her raised 
	voice in a conversation...

					KIRA...

			... YOU'RE THROWING IT ALL AWAY...
			ALL OF YOU...

					BAJORAN BUREAUCRAT...
				(MONITOR)
			... You're being a fool...

32   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)

	Seeing Major KIRA NERYS for the first time... a striking 
	Bajoran woman in her early thirties... dressed in a Bajoran 
	military uniform... ending her conversation to the Bajoran 
	official on the monitor...

					KIRA
				(fuming)
			... THEN DON'T ASK FOR MY OPINION 
			NEXT TIME!

	She turns off her monitor with a slap of her hand...  looks 
	immediately to Sisko at the door...

					KIRA
			Yes?

					SISKO
			I'm Benjamin Sisko...

					KIRA
				(without a beat)
			I suppose you want the office.

	Sisko does a take... suppressing an incredulous smile... 
	ENTERING...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT ONE        18.

32   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Well, actually I thought I'd say 
			hello first and then take the 
			office... but we could do it in any 
			order you'd like.

					KIRA
				(exaggerated)
			Hello.

					SISKO
			Is something bothering you, Major?

					KIRA
			You don't want to ask me that, 
			Commander...

					SISKO
			Why not?

					KIRA
			Because I have a bad habit of telling 
			the truth... even when people don't 
			want to hear it.

					SISKO
				(pleasant)
			Perhaps I want to hear it.

	A beat.  All right, fine...

					KIRA
			I don't believe the Federation has 
			any business being here.

	Sisko nods, takes a beat, then...

					SISKO
			The provisional government disagrees 
			with you...

					KIRA
			The provisional government and I 
			don't agree on a lot of things... 
			which is probably why they've sent 
			me to this god-forsaken place.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT ONE        19.

32   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KIRA
				(beat)
			I have been fighting for Bajoran 
			independence since I was old 
			enough to pick up a phaser...  
			finally, we drive out the 
			Cardassians... and what do our new 
			leaders do... call up the Federation 
			and invite them in...

					SISKO
			The Federation is only here to...

					KIRA AND SISKO
				(in unison)
			... help us/you.

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			... yes, I know.  The Cardassians 
			said the same thing sixty years ago.

					SISKO
			Major, when I was ordered here, I 
			requested a Bajoran national as my 
			first officer.  It made sense.  It 
			still does.  At least to me.  Now, 
			you and I are gonna have to...

	An alarm goes off... Kira reacts... presses some panels... 
	moves to a companel... a map of the station comes on the 
	monitor... with a signal flashing at a certain location... 
	she hits a panel... the monitor changes to a closeup of ODO 
	in the security office. Odo has an unfinished face without 
	distinct features. We'll learn why later on.

					KIRA
			Odo, are you reading something at A-
			fourteen?

					ODO
			My security array has been down for 
			two hours... I'll meet you there...

	The monitor goes back to standard feeds...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/12/92 - ACT ONE        20.

32   CONTINUED:	(3)

					KIRA
				(on the move)
			We've been having a lot of break-ins 
			lately... no need to come along, 
			Commander...

	But he ignores that and follows her out...

33   INT. ASSAYING OFFICE

	A nervous teenage Ferengi (NOG), watching guard at the door, 
	glances back...

					NOG
			Hurry up.

	Following his look to see the interior of the office is burned 
	out... finding a huge, hideous looking adult alien looting a 
	safe of some valuable mineral samples... putting them into a 
	pouch.  And as he moves toward the door...

34   INT. PROMENADE

	... they EXIT... react as they see Odo arriving...

					ODO
			All right, just stand where you are.

	The thieves turn the opposite direction and take a few steps 
	before they see Kira and Sisko arriving, cutting off that 
	route of escape too... Nog knows he's caught, gives up (NOTE:  
	He doesn't put up his hands) but the other alien takes out a 
	knife-like weapon... and throws it at...

38   ODO (OPTICAL)

	who twists his entire mid-section out of shape... and the 
	weapon flies by harmlessly and embeds itself in a wall... 
	meanwhile, the alien tries to sprint by him but Odo reforms...

39   WIDER (OPTICAL)

	... and grabs him roughly... the alien's bulk makes him 
	difficult to contain... and it looks like it could be a long 
	fight but before it even gets started, they are interrupted 
	by a phaser blast above their heads... they both react and 
	turn to see --

40   SISKO

	holding a phaser...

					SISKO
			That's enough.

					ODO
			Who the hell are you?

					KIRA
			This is our new Starfleet Commander, 
			Odo.

					ODO
				(unimpressed)
			I don't allow weapons on the 
			Promenade.  That includes phasers.

					QUARK
				(O.C.)
			Nog?  What's going on?

	They turn to see Quark arriving (we saw him earlier in the 
	bar).

					ODO
				(to Quark)
			The boy's in a lot of trouble.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT ONE        22.

40   CONTINUED:

	The boy looks away from Quark's inquiring look...
	Quark turns to Sisko...

					QUARK
			Commander, my name is Quark.  I used 
			to run the local gambling 
			establishment... this is my brother's 
			boy... surely you can see that he 
			only has a peripheral involvement in 
			all this... we're scheduled to depart 
			tomorrow...  if we could be permitted 
			to take him, I promise you he will 
			be severely...

	Sisko's mind is working... Interrupting --

					SISKO
			That won't be possible.
				(to Odo)
			Take him to the brig.

	Odo acknowledges, leads Nog and the alien away as Quark stares 
	bitterly at Sisko... then follows the others...

					KIRA
				(shakes her head)
			Quark probably sent the two of them 
			here to steal the ore samples in the 
			first place...

					SISKO
				(thoughtful)
			Major, there's a Ferengi legal 
			tradition... it's called Plea 
			Bargaining.  I might let the boy 
			go... but I want something in exchange 
			from Mister Quark...  something very 
			important...

	She looks at him curiously, before she can ask what he's 
	talking about...

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE
			O'Brien to Commander Sisko.

					SISKO
				(presses his combadge)
			Go ahead.

					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE
			Sir, the Enterprise hailed us again.  
			Captain Picard is waiting to see 
			you.

40   CONTINUED:

					SISKO

			This won't take long.

	He leaves toward the airlock... as she watches him go...

	FADE IN:

41   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	docked at DS9.

42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)

	Bajor is visible in the window... Picard sits at the end of 
	the table, going over some information on a PADD... a chime...

					PICARD
			Come.

	The door opens and Sisko ENTERS... Picard rises to greet him 
	warmly...

					PICARD
			Commander, come in.  Welcome to Bajor.

	Picard shakes his hand.

					SISKO
			It's been a long time, Captain.

	Picard looks at him curiously as they sit.

					PICARD
			Have we met before?

					SISKO
			Yessir.  We met in battle.  I was on 
			the Saratoga at Wolf 359.

	Picard blinks, acknowledging that Sisko has said something 
	entirely inappropriate.  He chooses to move on... but there 
	is a definite subtext that runs through the scene... Picard 
	is curt, remote... Sisko is Starfleet attentive but his eyes 
	are cold and angry...

					PICARD
			I assume you've been briefed on the 
			events leading to the Cardassian 
			withdrawal.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/14/92 - ACT TWO        25.

42   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Yessir... I understand they've spent 
			the last half century robbing the 
			planet of every valuable resource...  
			before abandoning it...

					PICARD
				(nods)
			They've left the Bajorans without 
			any way to be self-sustaining...  
			the relief efforts we've been 
			coordinating are barely adequate.

	He stands, deliberately putting distance between him and 
	Sisko, looks out the window at the planet in the distance...

					PICARD
			I've come to know the Bajora.
			I'm one of the strongest 
			proponents for their entry into 
			the Federation.

					SISKO
			Is it going to happen?

					PICARD
			Not easily.  The ruling parties 
			are at each others throats...
			factions that were united against 
			the Cardassians have resumed old 
			conflicts...

					SISKO
				(with an attitude)
			Sounds like they're not ready.

	Picard turns and looks at him sharply.

					PICARD
			Your job is to do everything short 
			of violating the Prime Directive to 
			make sure they are.

	Sisko defensively acknowledges.  Picard moves closer.

					PICARD
			Starfleet has made me aware of your 
			objections to this assignment, 
			Commander.  I would think that after 
			three years at the Utopia Planitia 
			yards, you'd be ready for a change.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - ACT TWO        26.

42   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
				(not backing off a bit)
			I have a son that I'm raising alone, 
			Captain.  This is not the ideal 
			environment.

					PICARD
			Unfortunately, as Starfleet officers, 
			we do not always have the luxury of 
			serving in an ideal environment.

					SISKO
			I realize that, sir.  And I'm 
			investigating the possibility of 
			returning to Earth for civilian 
			service.

	Picard reacts, studies him, doesn't like him.

					PICARD
			Perhaps Starfleet Command should 
			begin to consider a replacement for 
			you.

					SISKO
			That's probably a good idea.

	A beat.

					PICARD
			I'll look into it.  In the meantime...

	Sisko rises... interrupting...

					SISKO
			In the meantime, I'll do the job 
			I've been ordered to do to the best 
			of my ability, sir... thank you for 
			the briefing.

	He waits to be dismissed, locking eyes with Picard.
	Obviously, Picard hadn't intended to end the discussion 
	here... but finally after a long beat...

					PICARD
			Dismissed.

	Sisko EXITS and...

44   INT. SECURITY OFFICE - STARTING ON QUARK

	who is sitting...

					SISKO (O.S.)
			It's really quite simple, Quark, 
			you're not going to leave.

	Moving to reveal Sisko who is leaning against a wall, 
	casually... Odo's sitting at his desk... Odo reacts, looks 
	at Sisko...

					QUARK
				(reacts)
			Not going to leave... But we're all 
			packed and ready to...

					SISKO
			Unpack.

					QUARK
			Why would you want me to stay?

					ODO
				(looking to Sisko)
			I'm curious myself.  The man is a 
			gambler and a thief.

					QUARK
			I am not a thief.

					ODO
			You are a thief.

					QUARK
			If I am, you haven't been able to 
			prove it for four years...

	Sisko moves to the door, looking out to the Promenade...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        28.

44   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			My officers, the Bajoran engineers, 
			all their families depend on the 

			shops and services of this 
			Promenade... but if people like you 
			abandon it, this is going to become 
			a ghost town.  We need someone to 
			step forward and say, "I'm staying"... 
			"I'm rebuilding"... we need a 
			community leader... and it's going 
			to be...  you, Quark...

					QUARK
			Me?  A Community Leader?

	He glances at Odo... who sort of leans back in his chair and 
	grins, kind of liking this situation that Quark finds himself 
	in...

					ODO
				(why not?)
			You have all the character references 
			of a politician.

					QUARK
			How could I possibly operate my 
			establishment under Starfleet rules 
			of conduct?

					SISKO
			This is still a Bajoran station.
			We're just here to administrate.
			You run honest games, you won't 
			have any problems from me.

					ODO
				(grumps)
			'Honest' games, hmph...

	A beat.  Quark shakes his head.

					QUARK
			Commander, I've made a career out of 
			knowing when to leave.  This Bajoran 
			provisional government is far too 
			provisional for my taste.  And when 
			governments fall, people like me are 
			lined up and shot...

					SISKO
			Well, there is that risk... but then 
			you are a gambler, Quark...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        29.

44   CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			... and a thief...

					SISKO
				(preparing to leave, 
				overly "sincere")
			That poor kid is about to spend the 
			best years of his life in a Bajoran 
			prison.  I'm a father myself.  I 
			know what your brother must be going 
			through.  The boy should be with his 
			family... not in a cold jail cell...
				(beat)
			Think about it.

	He EXITS.  Quark is stunned... turns and looks at an amused 
	Odo...

					ODO
			You know, at first I didn't think I 
			was gonna like him.

	On Quark's reaction...

45   INT. PROMENADE

	Kira lifting heavy fragments of a broken wall, putting them 
	in a trash bin... usually far too mundane a job for an 
	officer.  Sisko arrives, reacts.

					SISKO
			Major... ?

					KIRA
				(shrugs)
			Everyone else is busy repairing the 
			primary systems...

	She pauses to make a point.

					KIRA
				(challenging)
			I suppose Starfleet officers aren't 
			used to getting their hands dirty...

	Sisko raises an eyebrow, moves to pick up a nearby 
	fragment...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        30.

					KIRA
			In the refugee camps, we learned to 
			do whatever had to be done...  it 
			didn't matter who you were...

	And as they start to load the fragments into the bin...  two 
	passersby react to the odd sight...

					SISKO
				(changing the subject)
			I was just talking to our good 
			neighbor Quark... he's laying odds 
			the government's going to fall...

					KIRA
			Quark knows a sure bet when he sees 
			it.
				(off Sisko's reaction)
			This government will be gone in a 
			week... and so will you...

					SISKO
			What happens to Bajor then?

					KIRA
			Civil War....

					SISKO
			You think it's inevitable...

					KIRA
				(nods)...
			The only one who can prevent it... 
			is Opaka.

					SISKO
			Opaka?

					KIRA
			Our spiritual leader.  She's known 
			as the Kai.  Our religion is the 
			only thing that holds my people 
			together.  If she would call for 
			unity, they would listen.

46   TWO SHOT

	She kneels to pick up some smaller pieces, Sisko kneels down 
	next to her and helps...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 09/03/92 - ACT TWO        31.

46   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
				(continuing)
			Leaders of all the factions have 
			been trying to get to her... but she 
			lives in seclusion and rarely sees 
			anyone...

	But on that line, a shadow falls over them and they
	look up to see --

47   LOW ANGLE - THE OLD MONK

	standing above them looking down... a long beat.

					MONK #1
			Commander.  It is time.

	He moves away...

48   SISKO'S FACE

	reacts curiously and he stands...

49   WIDE

	as he finds himself drawn to follow the Monk.   On Kira's 
	reaction...

50   EXT. BAJOR CAPITOL CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING (MATTE)

	Like Berlin after the war.  Devastated... wreckage...
	burned out buildings... what remains is a mystical looking 
	skyline with rounded domes and spherical shapes -- ancient 
	architecture that has somehow survived...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - ACT TWO        32.

51   INT. MONASTERY - DAY

	Dark, shadows... light streaming through cracks and holes in 
	the walls... close on a Monk (#2) who chants in mournful 
	three part harmony... as another, who is hobbled by injuries, 
	makes repairs to the building...  moving to find Sisko who 
	is shocked by the damage before him... the desecration is 
	appalling... windows smashed out... walls crushed... statues 
	beheaded...

					KAI OPAKA (O.S.)
			Commander Sisko...

	Sisko turns toward the shadows of an entry way to see

52   THE FIGURE OF A WOMAN

	And as she emerges from the dark... we see a strange looking, 
	middle aged Bajoran dressed in a colorful sheath... there is 
	a centered calm in her, she seems to exist on a higher plane.  
	Yet there is a deep sadness in this woman who carries the 
	pain of her people.  She has been hurt... her face is badly 
	bruised... her scalp has a small bandage... a cane supports 
	a bad limp...

					KAI OPAKA
			I apologize for the conditions in 
			which we greet you...

					SISKO
				(knowingly)
			The Cardassians... ?

	Opaka acknowledges, leads Sisko deeper into the Monastery... 
	they reach a sacred area featuring a lovely reflecting pool 
	in the center... Opaka sits not on a pulpit but in a casual 
	area side by side with Sisko on a wooden bench...

					KAI OPAKA
				(continuing)
			Your arrival has been greatly 
			anticipated.

	Sisko reacts, good, maybe this will be easy... and he can 
	make a quick exit...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        33.

52   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			I'm glad to hear that.  If Bajor can 
			join the Federation it will bring 
			stability...

					KAI OPAKA
				(interrupting)
			I do not speak of the Federation.
			I speak of your arrival...

					SISKO
			Mine?

	Opaka doesn't respond but reaches out with a hand and gently 
	cups one side of Sisko's face like a grandmother studying 
	the face of a child...

					KAI OPAKA
			Have you ever explored your pagh, 
			Commander?

					SISKO
			Pagh?

	Opaka's hand moves to Sisko's ear... a finger runs down the 
	outer rim slowly...

					KAI OPAKA
			A Bajoran draws courage from his 
			spiritual life... our lifeforce, our 
			pagh, is replenished by the 
			prophets...

	An inner calm coming to her eyes, a witness to a miracle... 
	terribly moved... Opaka squeezes the earlobe... surprising 
	Sisko who's head jerks with pain...

					KAI OPAKA
				(knowingly, with 
				sympathy)
			Breathe.

					SISKO
				(uncomfortable)
			Kai Opaka, if we could discuss your 
			role in the post-Cardassian 
			transition...

					KAI OPAKA
			Breathe.

	And begins to run her fingers back up the edge of the ear...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - ACT TWO        34.

52   CONTINUED:	(2)

					KAI OPAKA
			Ironic.  One who does not wish to be 
			among us is to be the emissary.

	Sisko reacts, the emissary to Bajor?  What did she mean?  Is 
	his lack of interest so obvious?  Her face studies every 
	microridge... finally she is finished.

					KAI OPAKA
			Please come with me...

	Opaka abruptly stands and Sisko reacts, rises ... as well... 
	she takes a tiny remote control out of her pocket and when 
	she touches it...

53   ANGLE - THE REFLECTING POOL (OPTICAL)

	Disappears... it was a hologram... revealing a carved stone 
	stairway.  Sisko follows her down...

54   INT. A SECRET CAVERN DEEP BELOW THE MONASTERY

	Dark... mysterious... lit by candles... the...
	stairway leads into a small dark cellar... Opaka, using her 
	cane, leads Sisko down the stairs...

					KAI OPAKA
			You are correct that Bajor is in 
			grave jeopardy... but it is the threat 
			to our spiritual life that far 
			outweighs any other...

					SISKO
			Perhaps, but I'm powerless until I 
			have a unified...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        35.

54   CONTINUED:

					KAI OPAKA
			I cannot give you what you deny 
			yourself...

					SISKO
			I'm sorry... ?

					KAI OPAKA
			Look for solutions from within, 
			Commander...

	Sisko tries to figure that one out as Opaka moves to an ark 
	and opens it...

55   ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Inside, there is a mesmerizing sight... floating within a 
	forcefield is a strange, floating orb, shaped like an hour 
	glass... glowing green, transparent...  Opaka steps away...

56   CLOSE ON SISKO

	as he moves forward, studying it, his face green with the 
	reflected light...

					SISKO
			What is it?

57   ANGLE

	to see Opaka behind him...

					KAI OPAKA
			The tear of the prophet.

	She disappears behind a rockface, and as Sisko reacts, 
	turns...

58   REVERSE ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	to see the orb's forcefield disappear... and suddenly the 
	green light spins out and envelops Sisko, like a whirling 
	cyclone, blinding out the surrounding chamber... and when it 
	clears... he's standing just as before, but he's no longer 
	in the chamber and no longer in his Starfleet uniform... 
	instead he finds himself on...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        36.

59   EXT. BEACH - DAY

	wearing a bathing suit, holding a tray of three drinks... 
	he's fifteen years younger... looking around him...

					SISKO
			What... the hell... Opaka?

	Some passers-by give him an odd look... after a second, he 
	realizes that

60   HIS FEET

	are burning on the sand...

					SISKO
				(re: his feet)
			Ahh...

	He prances on his tip-toes looking for some relief...

61   ANGLE

	Looking rather silly, finally, because he just has to do 
	it... he jumps on a stranger's blanket...  inadvertently 
	kicking sand on a woman who is laying on her stomach...

					JENNIFER
			Hey!

					SISKO
			I'm sorry... it's just that the sand 
			was burning my...

	He stops as she turns over, holding the loose bra to her 
	breast... she's wearing 24th century sunglasses...  he is 
	stunned as he looks at her... doesn't say a word... as he 
	kneels down and reaches out... and she recoils a bit as she 
	doesn't know what he's doing...  and he takes her sunglasses 
	off...

					SISKO
			Jen... Jennifer... ?

					JENNIFER
				(unrecognized blinks)
			Yes... ?  I'm sorry... did we meet 
			last night at George's party... ?

					SISKO
			George?  Jennifer... wait a minute, 
			this is impossible.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        37.

61   CONTINUED:

	He stands up... looks around in nightmarish confusion...

					JENNIFER
			Are you okay?

					SISKO
				(looking around, 
				stunned, to himself)
			I know this place... This is Gilgo 
			Beach.  Where we met.

					JENNIFER
			We've met here... before?

					SISKO
			I was carrying...

	He looks at the three lemonades.

					SISKO
			... three lemonades...

	She looks at him uneasily... ties her brassiere on...

					SISKO
				(continuing)
			My feet were burning... I stopped 
			here... do you understand how 
			incredible this is?  No of course 
			you don't.  Jennifer.

	He looks at her trying to contain the emotions... 
	there are so many things he wants to tell her... but
	all he can get out is --

					SISKO
			Have a lemonade.

					JENNIFER
			Sorry, I don't accept drinks from 
			strange men on the beach...

	She looks at him with vague amusement, gets up, starts to 
	walk briskly along the water's edge... he gets up, follows 
	her...

62   ALONG THE BEACH

	as he catches up... they continue to walk...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        38.

					JENNIFER
			Tell me the truth.  Did we really 
			meet before?

	A beat.  Sisko looks at her... how does he tell her...  what 
	can he tell her... finally, he decides to tell the "truth"...

					SISKO
			No.

					JENNIFER
				(smiles, shakes her 
				head)
			So how did you know my name?

					SISKO
			I...
				(beat)
			George told me... at the party...

					JENNIFER
			Are you going to tell me your name?

					SISKO
			Oh.  Sorry.  Ben Sisko.  I...
			I just graduated from Starfleet 
			Academy... I'm waiting for my 
			first posting...

					JENNIFER
			A junior officer.  My mother warned 
			me to watch out for junior officers...

					SISKO
			Your mother's going to adore me.

					JENNIFER
			You're awfully sure of yourself.

					SISKO
			It's not every day you meet the girl 
			you're going to marry.

	That stops her in her tracks... she laughs at his impudence.

					JENNIFER
			Do you use this routine a lot with 
			women... ?


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        39.

62   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			No.  Never before.  And never again.

					JENNIFER
			Sure...

					SISKO
			How about letting me cook dinner for 
			you tonight... my father was a gourmet 
			chef... I'll make his famous aubergine 
			stew.

					JENNIFER
			I don't know...

					SISKO
			You're supposed to say yes...

63   ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	The Orb is floating in the air above the beach... only he 
	can see it... he reacts... she looks at him and smiles, shakes 
	her head...

					JENNIFER
			I'll probably be sorry...

					SISKO
				(urgently)
			Jennifer...

	The green light spins out of the orb... The light envelopes 
	him... The light clears... he is back in...

64   INT. CHAMBER UNDER THE MONASTERY (OPTICAL)

	As the experience has ended... he... sees Opaka standing 
	there... closing the ark, the orb inside...  he is shaken by 
	the experience, his legs tremble...  his attempt to disguise 
	the emotional impact of the event is far short...

					SISKO
				(softly)
			Is it some kind of holographic device?


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT TWO        40.

64   CONTINUED:

					KAI OPAKA
			No.  What you experienced barely 
			begins to reveal its powers...
			This orb appeared in the skies 
			over ten thousand years ago.
			Eight others have been discovered 
			since. Tradition says they 
			were sent from the Celestial Temple.
			What they have taught us has 
			shaped our theology.

	She lifts the ark and hands it to Sisko... it is a meaningful, 
	spiritual moment for Opaka... Sisko reacts with curiosity...

					KAI OPAKA
			It will lead you to the Temple.

					SISKO
			Excuse me... ?

					KAI OPAKA
				(with greater emphasis)
			You must find the Celestial Temple 
			and warn the prophets.

					SISKO
				(beat)
			Warn "them" about what?

					KAI OPAKA
			The Cardassians took the other 
			eight orbs.  They will stop at 
			nothing to decipher their 
			powers... even if it means 
			discovering where they came from.
			If they do, they might destroy 
			the Celestial Temple itself... 
			which could mean the spiritual 
			disintegration of Bajor.


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - ACT TWO        41.

64   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			To expect me to go off on some sort 
			of... of quest...

					KAI OPAKA
			I cannot unite my people until I 
			know that the prophets have been 
			forewarned.

	She looks at him -- it's as simple as that.  Do this or I 
	cannot help you.  A slight sympathetic smile crosses her 
	face...  The Kai looks at him knowingly...

					KAI OPAKA
			You will seek the prophets.  In the 
			end, not for Bajor and not for the 
			Federation... but for yourself, for 
			your own pagh.  It is, quite simply, 
			Commander, the journey you have always 
			been destined to take.

	Off Sisko's reaction...

									FADE OUT.

65   EXT. SPACE - DS9 (OPTICAL)

	Establishing.  The Enterprise is still docked.

66   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS

	Dark as he ENTERS... he moves through the first room without 
	turning on the lights into...

67   JAKE'S ROOM

	where the boy is asleep in his clothes on the floor on the 
	cushion, looking uncomfortable... we might see some 24th 
	century teenage paraphernalia to establish that the kid has 
	had something to do in his room all this time... Sisko looks 
	down at him and grins, kneels to pull a blanket over him... 
	finds that he has to remove a catcher's glove containing a 
	baseball from the boy's hand... Sisko studies the boy's 
	face...  after a beat, the boy's sleepy eyes open and see 
	his father looking down at him...

					JAKE
				(sleepy)
			What?

					SISKO
				(softly)
			I was just thinking how much you 
			look like your mom.

	The boy smiles in his sleep and Sisko strokes his hair once 
	and stands... and as he puts down the glove and baseball on 
	a table and... moves out of the room...

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Kira to Sisko...

	Sisko closes the door behind him before responding...

					SISKO
			Go ahead, Major.

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Sorry to disturb you, Commander.
			But there's something on the 
			Promenade you might want to see.

	Off his reaction...


       DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT THREE       43.

68   INT. PROMENADE

	On a Turbolift as Sisko arrives... reacts to what we don't 
	see yet... but we do hear alien music and as he leads us 
	there, we reveal that Quark's is open for business... and it 
	is a beacon for the otherwise unlighted thoroughfare... people 
	are arriving... we can see smiling faces for the first time...

69   INT. QUARK'S - CLOSE ON A SPINNING VERTICAL WHEEL

	an alien version of roulette... moving to find the Ferengi 
	Pit Boss running the game...

					PIT BOSS
			Fortune's fates are with you today, 
			friends... prompt wagers, please... 
			I'm sorry, Madame, Quark's does not 
			accept travelers' vouchers... gold 
			or hard currency, please... final 
			wagers...

	And as we continue to move to see a crowded, smoky gambling 
	facility... various gaming tables, some games we recognize, 
	some we don't... at one table, a voice yells --

					FEMALE VOICE
			Dabo!

	And everyone at the table groans like someone lost big... we 
	continue our move to see an alien musician playing a strange 
	instrument... past the stairs, where a couple is being 
	escorted up by a Ferengi... finally coming to the entrance 
	where Sisko is ENTERING from the Promenade... glancing 
	around... he moves toward the Bar...

70   AT THE BAR

	Quark moves to him...

					QUARK
			What'll you have, Commander?

					SISKO
			How's the local synthale?

					QUARK
			You won't like it.
				(off Sisko's reaction)
			I love the Bajorans... such a deeply 
			spiritual culture... but they make a 
			dreadful ale.


       DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/21/92 - ACT THREE       44.

70   CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			Don't ever trust an ale from a god

	During the above, Quark has been drawing an ale from beneath 
	the bar... and as he places it front of Sisko, with 
	punctuation...

					QUARK
				(continuing)
			... or a Starfleet Commander who has

72   INT. PROMENADE

	Sisko and Kira ENTER from the Airlock Gate accompanied by 
	two officers in Starfleet blue uniforms... one is DOCTOR 
	JULIAN BASHIR, human, male, mid-twenties, wide-shouldered 
	with a boyish face, cocky with a little too much confidence.  
	He carries a shoulder bag.  The other is LIEUTENANT JADZIA 
	DAX, late twenties, very attractive with a serene manner and 
	a dry, affectionate sense of humor...

					KIRA
			Commander, if you'd like me to give 
			them a tour of the station...


       DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/21/92 - ACT THREE       45.

72   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			You and Doctor Bashir go ahead...

	I'm afraid I have to put Lieutenant Dax right to work...

	As she begins to lead him toward the Promenade, Bashir 
	turns to Dax trying not very successfully to disguise
	a deeper interest with a casual invitation --

					BASHIR
			Maybe we could get together later, 
			Jadzia... for dinner or a drink...

					DAX
			I'd be delighted.

	Sisko raises an eyebrow at Bashir's interest... and they 
	separate.  We stay with Dax and Sisko as they move down a 
	thoroughfare... There's a quick, familiar repartee to their 
	exchanges...

					SISKO
			He's a little young for you, isn't 
			he?

					DAX
				(slightly amused)
			He's twenty-seven.  i'm twenty-
			eight.

					SISKO
			Three hundred and twenty-eight, maybe.  
			Did you tell him about that slug 
			inside you?

	Meant and received as an affectionate insult that only one's 
	closest friend would make.  She smiles.

					DAX
			Yes, Benjamin, he knows I'm a 
			Trill.  He finds it fascinating.
			He's never met a joined species 
			before.

					SISKO
			I wonder if he'd've been as fascinated 
			if you still looked the way you did 
			the last time I saw you.

					DAX
				(teasingly)
			Perhaps not.

	A beat.  Sisko grins, shakes his head...


       DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/21/92 - ACT THREE       46.

72   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			This is going to take some getting 
			used to.

					DAX
			Don't be ridiculous.  I'm still the 
			same Dax...
				(a beat)
			... more or less...

	They walk into a Turbolift.

73   INT. INFIRMARY

	Kira leads Bashir inside a small, examining room type 
	facility... one table... some panels... major damage has 
	been done by vandals...

					KIRA
			I'm afraid we've had some security 
			problems... looks like looters got 
			in here...

	Bashir looks around... rather than being depressed by the 
	size or lack of equipment... there is an excitement in his 
	eyes...

					BASHIR
			This'll be perfect... real...
				(searching for the 
				right description)
			... frontier medicine...

					KIRA
			Frontier medicine?

					BASHIR
			Major... I had my choice of any job 
			in the fleet...

	Noting the arrogance...

					KIRA
			Did you...

					BASHIR
				(gung-ho)
			I didn't want some cushy job...  or 
			a research grant... I wanted this.  
			The farthest reaches of the galaxy. 
			One of the most remote outposts

			This is where heroes are made.
			Right here.  In the wilderness.

				(dry)
			This wilderness is my home.

					BASHIR
				(reacts)
			I didn't mean...

					KIRA
				(sharp, with sarcasm)
			The Cardassians left behind a lot of 
			injured people, Doctor... you can

			the "natives"...  you'll find 
			them a friendly, simple folk...

	She EXITS... on his reaction... ...

74   INT. LABORATORY - CLOSE ON THE ORB (OPTICAL)

	behind the forcefield...

					SISKO
			We do have one advantage.  The monks 
			have been studying these things for 
			ten thousand years...

	I've had our computers set up to interface with their 
	historical data banks...

					DAX
			That should give us something...

74   CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(acknowledges)
			Soon as possible, Dax.  The eight

	She nods.  He begins to leave...

					DAX
			Benjamin...
				(he pauses)
			I was happy when I heard you'd 
			accepted this assignment... I'd been

	He looks at her evenly.  With affection --

					SISKO
			It's good to see you too, old man.

	She smiles and he EXITS.  Dax takes a thoughtful beat, where 
	to begin?... moves to a console...

					DAX
			Computer, create a chronological 
			data base for all historical 
			references to the orbs... plus...

			Couldn't you modify the subspace

	A beat.  O'Brien begins to get her logic...

					O'BRIEN
			So we could lower the inertial mass...

					DAX
				(nods)
			If you can make the station lighter,

					O'BRIEN
				(a beat, it might

			She is part of your existence.

					SISKO
			She is part of my past.  She's no 
			longer alive.

					JENNIFER ALIEN
			But she is part of your existence.

					SISKO
			Yes, she was a most important part 
			of my existence.  But I lost her 
			some time ago.

					JENNIFER ALIEN
			"Lost" - what is this?

					SISKO
			In a linear existence, we can't go 
			back to the past to get something we 
			left behind... so it's lost...

					JENNIFER ALIEN
				(come on, you've got 
				to be kidding)
			It is inconceivable that any species 
			could exist in such a manner... you 
			are deceiving us...

					SISKO
			No, this is the truth...

	Standing, taking in the setting...

					SISKO
			This day... this park... it was 
			almost... fifteen years ago.  Far in 
			the past.  It was a very important 
			day to me... a day that shaped every 
			day that followed.

	That is the essence of a linear existence... each day affects 
	the next...

	She studies him intently... we pan to follow her look

	as she sees --


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - ACT SIX        96.

202  ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	An exact duplicate of the setting we were just in...

	a second set of Sisko and Jennifer are reclining on the 
	ground... in each other's arms... playful children's voices 
	are way in the background... this is a replay of the actual 
	experience... Jennifer Alien and Sisko watch their doubles...

					SISKO #2
				(enjoying the moment)
			Listen to it...

					JENNIFER
			To what?

					SISKO #2
			The sound of children playing.
			What could be more beautiful...

					JENNIFER
			So you like children... ?

					SISKO #2
				(beat)
			That almost sounds like a domestic 
			inquiry...

203  ANGLE - TWO SHOT

	Losing Jennifer Alien and Sisko.

					JENNIFER
			I've heard Starfleet officers don't 
			want families because they complicate 
			their lives.

					SISKO #2
			Starfleet officers don't often find 
			mates who want to raise families on 
			a starship...

					JENNIFER
			That almost sounds like a domestic 
			inquiry...

					SISKO #2
				(smiles, the question 
				in his eyes)
			I think it was...

	Her answer to him is a deeply felt kiss...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/10/92 - ACT SIX        97.

204  SISKO AND JENNIFER ALIEN

	She reacts curiously to the kiss... the emotional impact is 
	heavy on Sisko but he watches... tries to remain the detached 
	instructor...

					 SISKO

			As corporeal entities, humans
			find physical touch to cause
			pleasure...

					 JENNIFER ALIEN

			"Pleasure" - what is this?

					 SISKO
			Good feelings... happiness...

	... but the words get lost in his throat as the moment finally 
	hits him... rack focus as Jennifer alien turns to observe 
	him... Sisko turns his eyes away and finds

	himself looking at --

205  DORAN, THE WOMAN IN THE FIERY CORRIDOR

	with the mournful eyes, except she's an alien... and suddenly 
	he's back on the Saratoga...

206  REVERSE ANGLE - INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

	as he looks around... sees the Bolian Tactical Officer

	(an alien) next to him... he reacts... he does not want to 
	revisit what is at the end of this... the aliens notice the 
	reluctance... he looks down the corridor toward his 
	quarters... does not want to go...

					DORAN ALIEN
				(what's the problem?)
			This is your existence...

					SISKO
			Yes.  But... it is difficult to return 
			here... more difficult than any other 
			memory...

					TACTICAL OFFICER ALIEN
			Why?

	And this is hard for him, analyzing the death of his wife, 
	standing by the flames that killed her...  impossible to 
	stay detached from the emotions this raises...


        DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - ACT SIX        98.

206  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
			Because this was the day... I lost 
			Jennifer...
				(beat, exhausted)
			... And I don't want to be here...

	And now he looks up to see the incongruous arrival of Jennifer 
	alien in her bathing suit... moving cooly down the fiery 
	hallway to him...

					JENNIFER ALIEN
			Then why do you exist here?

					SISKO
			I... I don't understand...

					JENNIFER ALIEN
				(confused)
			You exist here.

	He looks at her... feeling miserable, confused... but before 
	any further explanations can be attempted...
	something startling occurs... the images freeze and begin to 
	melt away...

			Your linear nature is inherently

					SISKO
			We don't...

227  EXT. FISHING POND - DAY - JAKE ALIEN

			Yes.

					JENNIFER ALIEN

229  CATCHER'S MITT

	as a bat swings and misses a ball as it pops into the glove.  
	Pan up to find Jake Alien is the catcher... and a batter 
	stands in front of him, both dressed in Chicago Cubs uniforms 
	of the early 1920s...


					BATTER ALIEN
				(accusing)
			Aggressive.  Adversarial.


       DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/17/92 - ACT SEVEN      104.

230  REVERSE ANGLE - EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

	Sisko is standing on a pitcher's mound, wearing a Cubs cap 
	circa 1923... and his Starfleet uniform...  in the background, 
	the rest of the Cubs' team works out... playing catch, hitting 
	fungos, fielding... a few spectators and reporters in straw 
	hats mill about...

					SISKO
				(correction)
			Competition.  For fun.  It's 
			a game... that Jake and I play...  
			on the Holodeck... it's called 
			baseball.

	And Jake alien stands out of his crouch and as he takes off 
	the mask and looks at it curiously... and then looks around 
	at the environment... joining Sisko on the mound...

					JAKE ALIEN
			"Baseball" - what is this?

					SISKO
			I was afraid you'd ask that...

	A beat... How the hell do you explain baseball to an alien... 
	he takes a deep breath, well, here goes...

					SISKO
			I throw the ball to you... and this 
			other player stands between us with 
			a bat, a stick... and he... he tries 
			to hit the ball in between these two 
			white lines...

	Jake alien blinks with confusion, Sisko pauses...  regroups... 
	getting another idea... his delivery growing with confidence 
	as he continues...

					SISKO
			The rules aren't important...  what's 
			important is -- it's linear.  
			Every time you throw this ball a 
			hundred different things can happen 
			in the game... he might swing and 
			miss, he might hit it...  the point 
			is you never know...  you try to 
			anticipate, set a strategy for all 
			the possibilities as best you can... 
			but in the end it all comes down to 
			throwing one pitch after another... 
			and seeing what happens.  With each 
			new consequence, the game begins to 
			take shape...

230  CONTINUED:

					BATTER ALIEN
				(grasping the meaning)
			And you have no idea what that shape 
			is until it is completed...

					SISKO
				(beat)
			That's right.  In fact, the game 
			wouldn't be worth playing if we knew 
			what was going to happen.

					JAKE ALIEN
				(flabbergasted)
			You value your ignorance of what is 
			to come?

					SISKO
				(acknowledges, driving 
				home his point)
			That may be the most important thing 
			to understand about humans.
			It is the unknown that defines 
			our existence.  We are constantly 
			searching... not just for answers 
			to our questions... but for new 
			questions.  We are explorers... 
			we explore our lives day by day...
			and we explore the galaxy, trying 
			to expand the boundaries of our 
			knowledge.  And that is why I'm 
			here.  Not to conquer you either 
			with weapons or with ideas.  But 
			to co-exist and learn.

231  JAKE ALIEN

	studies him curiously for a beat...

232  SISKO

	waits hopefully for a response... reacts as he looks down at

			Mister O'Brien, can you establish a

			I'm all you've got.

	A beat.  He studies her.

					JASAD
			I am Gul Jasad of the Cardassian 
			Guard, Seventh Order.  Where is our 
			warship?

					KIRA
			With any luck, they're in the Gamma 
			Quadrant.  On the other side of the 
			wormhole.

					JASAD
				(explodes)
			What wormhole?  Our sensors show no 
			indication of a wormhole in this 
			sector.

					KIRA
			That's because it just collapsed.

					DAX
			We believe it was artificially 
			created.  That may be why our sensors 
			never picked up any of the usual 
			quantum fluctuation patterns...

					JASAD
				(furious)
			You expect me to believe that someone 
			created a wormhole...
			And now conveniently disassembled it?

	He cuts transmission... his ship reappears on the viewscreen.

			Red alert.  Shields up.

					O'BRIEN
			What shields?

	Kira reacts but before she has any time to pursue the

					DAX
			They're hailing us again.

				(beat)
			Open the channel.

			We do not accept your explanation.
			Somehow you have destroyed our warship...

	and a replay of the actual events (as we did with the picnic

					 SISKO

			I was ready to die with her...

					 TACTICAL OFFICER ALIEN

			"Die" - what is this?

	And it is Jennifer Alien who answers... as understanding

					 JENNIFER ALIEN
			The termination of their linear

       DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/25/92 - ACT EIGHT      112.

244  JENNIFER ALIEN AND SISKO (OPTICAL)

	As she studies him and sees his pain... and then reaches out 
	and places it on his shoulder with comfort... he reacts to 
	the touch of her hand and looks into her eyes... and they 
	aren't so alien anymore...  it is the first overt physical 
	contact they have made with him... a link... an 
	understanding... she looks back at the scene --

					TACTICAL OFFICER
			Now, sir...

	As the Tactical Officer lifts him by the shoulder...

	He continues to pull him out of the room...

					SISKO #2
			Dammit... we can't leave her here...

	During the above, Sisko is beginning to make a realization...

					SISKO

			I've never left this ship...

					JENNIFER ALIEN

			You exist here.

					SISKO

			I... exist here.

	The Tactical Officer leads Sisko #2 out... Sisko steps slowly 
	forward and moves to his dead wife taking the place of his 
	double... picks up her hand...

					SISKO
				(to the aliens)
			I don't know if you can understand.  
			I see her like this every time I 
			close my eyes... in the darkness in 
			the blink of an eye, she's there... 
			like this...

					JENNIFER ALIEN
			None of your past experiences helped 
			prepare you for this consequence...

	Sisko shakes his head, slowly...


       DEEP SPACE: "Emissary" REV. FINAL 08/21/92 - ACT EIGHT      113.

244  CONTINUED:

					SISKO
				(softly)
			And I've never figured out how to 
			live without her.

					JENNIFER ALIEN
			So you choose to exist here.

	He nods, unable to speak... she moves closer...

					JENNIFER ALIEN
			It is not linear.

	And of course it is so simple in its truth...

					SISKO
			No.  It's not... linear.

	Sisko gently places down the hand of his dead wife... 
	and as he accepts that this is really the end of their 
	life together, tears roll down his cheeks, and he 
	begins to truly grieve his loss.  After a beat, he 
	stands, turns... and Jennifer alien is no longer there.
	He understands, exchanges a meaningful look with the remaining 
	three aliens (Tactical officer, Opaka, and Jake).  In this 
	moment, two species have finally come to understand one 
	another... to learn from one another... it is the end to the

	A beat as she steps forward to the viewscreen...

			You're probably right, Jasad. And if
