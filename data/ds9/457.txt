SPACE (OPTICAL)	The Defiant enters orbit around Earth.					SISKO (V.O.)			Commander's Log.  Stardate 48481.2.  			My senior staff and I have been asked 			to address the annual Starfleet 			Symposium on the current situation 			in the Gamma Quadrant.  I'm looking 			forward to the opportunity... and to 			visiting my sister in Portland.2    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE	SISKO, KIRA, O'BRIEN, DAX, BASHIR and ODO are on the bridge 	of the Defiant.  Dax is at the helm, Sisko is in the command 	chair.  The other crewmembers are scattered about the bridge 	along with N.D.s.					DAX			Entering Earth orbit.3    INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	Which now displays a view of the Earth from space.  Sisko 	gets up out of his chair and looks at the globe 	appreciatively.					SISKO			Now there's something I never get 			tired of looking at.					DAX			If you ask me, the seas could be a 			little more purple.					KIRA			Funny, I was just thinking they 			weren't green enough.					BASHIR			I guess it's true what they say.  			"There's no place like home."      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/25/94 - TEASER       2.3    CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(to Kira and Dax)			No matter what color the water is.	Dax smiles in acknowledgement.  O'Brien's panel beeps.					O'BRIEN			Commander, I'm receiving an incoming 			emergency message...				(looks concerned)			It's from DS Nine.					SISKO			On screen.4    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As the view of Earth is replaced by the face of QUARK.					QUARK				(on Viewscreen)			Commander... am I glad to see you.					KIRA				(with disapproval)			This better be good, Quark.  You're 			on an emergency channel.					QUARK				(on Viewscreen)			I just received a message from the 			Grand Nagus.  He wanted me to remind 			you of the critical role he played 			in establishing contact with the 			Dominion.					SISKO			You can assure the Nagus his 			assistance will be mentioned 			prominently in my report to Starfleet.	But Quark doesn't look happy.					QUARK				(on Viewscreen)			There was one more thing, Commander.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/25/94 - TEASER       3.4    CONTINUED:					QUARK			It seems the Nagus's nephew Belongo 			is currently being held by Starfleet 			authorities on Aldebaron Three... a 			slight misunderstanding, I'm sure.					SISKO			A misunderstanding the Nagus no doubt 			would like cleared up.				(a beat)			I do owe him a favor.					QUARK			He thinks so too.  And to quote the 			one hundred and eleventh Rule of 			Acquisition...					SISKO			"Treat people in your debt like 			family... exploit them."				(off Quark's reaction)			I've been reading up.				(a beat)			Tell the Nagus that I'll do what I 			can, but remind him of the two hundred 			and seventeenth Rule of Acquisition.					QUARK			"You can't free a fish from water"				(smiles in approval)			I'll be sure the Nagus gets the 			message.	Quark ends the transmission.5    RESUME SCENE	As Sisko reacts with amusement.					DAX				(to Sisko)			We'd better get ready, Benjamin.				(off his reaction, 				reminding him)			Dinner, tonight.  With Admiral 			Drazman.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/27/94 - TEASER       4.5    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(reacting to the name)			Not "Droner" Drazman?  The commander 			of the Proxima Maintenance Yards?	Sisko looks glum.  He's not looking forward to this dinner.					BASHIR				(to O'Brien)			You're more than welcome to come 			along.  The entire senior staff was 			invited.					O'BRIEN			Full dress uniforms... fine table 			linens... and a different fork for 			every course... thanks but no thanks.  			That's why I stayed an enlisted man.  			No one expects us to show up for 			formal dinners.					DAX				(to Kira and Odo)			Major, Constable, care to join us?					KIRA			No thanks.					ODO			I'd say this is strictly a Starfleet 			occasion.	Bashir looks disappointed.  He was hoping to spread the misery 	around a little.6    INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM	Like all the facilities on the Defiant, this is a compact, 	yet efficiently designed room.  There's a smaller version of 	the standard Starfleet six-man pad and an operator's console.  	O'Brien takes his place at the console while Sisko, Bashir 	and Dax step onto the pad.					SISKO				(to Kira)			She's all yours, Major.				(to O'Brien)			Energize, Mister O'Brien.					O'BRIEN			Aye, sir.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - TEASER       5.6    CONTINUED:	O'Brien engages the transporter.7    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As Sisko, Dax, and Bashir beam out...					O'BRIEN			That's strange.	O'Brien calmly makes a small adjustment to the controls.					KIRA			What's wrong?					O'BRIEN				(as he works)			Nothing serious.  Just a power 			fluctuation in the annular confinement 			beam.				(something goes wrong)			Hold on.  That's impossible.					KIRA			What happened?					O'BRIEN			I stabilized the beam... but according 			to our sensors they never materialized 			at their destination.				(a beat)			They're just... gone.	And on Kira and O'Brien's worried expressions, we...									CUT TO:8    EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ALLEY - DAY #1	Sisko is laying unconscious on a sidewalk.  His combadge is 	missing from his uniform, as are his insignia pips.  Suddenly 	he's prodded in the ribs by a HIGH TECH POLICE SHOTGUN.  	These days it would be cutting edge technology, but by the 	early days of the twenty-first century it's standard issue.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/27/94 - TEASER       6.9    NEW ANGLE	As Sisko slowly regains consciousness to see a Police Officer, 	VIN, standing over him, poking him with the barrel of his 	shotgun.  Vin is a Sergeant, with twenty years on the force, 	gruff and jaded.					VIN			Look what we have here.	As Sisko stands up, a second police officer, BERNARDO, yanks 	Bashir to his feet.  Bernardo is younger and less experienced 	than Vin, and as a result, he's a little more affable and 	idealistic.  Both cops wear the uniforms of the Sanctuary 	District Police, which are less severe than the ones we're 	used to.					SISKO				(to Vin)			Who are you?					VIN			Who am I?				(to Bernardo)			Do you believe this?  Sleeping 			Beauty's asking me questions.					BERNARDO			Hey Vin, we've been working all 			night... why don't we forget these 			guys?  I just want to go home and 			see Sonya and the kids, and get some 			sleep.	Bashir holds his head.  He's having trouble standing and 	both he and Sisko are groggy and disoriented.					VIN			What are you, an anarchist?  There's 			a law against sleeping in the streets.	The cop looks from Sisko to Bashir, noticing the uniforms.					VIN			Though I do like the matching pajamas.				(to Sisko)			All right, let's see some logo.					SISKO			Logo?      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - TEASER       7.9    CONTINUED:					VIN			I.D.				(off reaction)			Identification.  UHC Card?  Transit 			pass?	Sisko looks around, trying to get his bearings.					BASHIR			Where are we?  What happened to 			Starfleet Headquarters?	Vin reacts to Bashir with disdain.					VIN				(to his partner, 				sarcastic)			Perfect.  Just what we need... two 			more dims.	Sisko finally realizes what's going on.					SISKO			Shotguns... those uniforms... There's 			something familiar about them.					VIN			Yeah, probably from the last time 			you were in a Sanctuary District.					SISKO				(recognizes the term)			Sanctuary District?				(to Vin)			What year is this?					BERNARDO			Same year it was yesterday... Twenty 			twenty-four.				(prods Bashir with 				his shotgun)			Let's go.					VIN			How do they find us?	The two cops escort Sisko and Bashir out into...10   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY #1	This is not the San Francisco of today.  There are no cars 	on the street and no mailboxes.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - TEASER       8.10   CONTINUED:	The businessmen and women on the street are wearing 	clothing similar to that of the twentieth century, with enough 	small changes to let us know it's not our own time... We're 	somewhere in the early twenty-first century.	As the cops escort Sisko and Bashir away, we pull back to 	reveal...11   DAX	Also unconscious, lying just out of view in a subway 	stairwell.  Hold on her for a beat, then...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY #1	Dax is still unconscious.  A man's hand gently touches her 	neck to take her pulse.  The man, CHRIS BRYNNER, is about 	Dax's age, maybe a little older, well dressed and well 	groomed.  He looks concerned.  He puts his hand on her 	forehead to feel her temperature.	Dax's eyes flutter open.					CHRIS			Are you okay?	Dax sits up.  She immediately grabs her head and groans.					DAX			My head...					CHRIS			What happened... Did you get jacked 			or something?					DAX			Jacked?					CHRIS			You know, robbed?	Dax is starting to shake off some of the grogginess.  She 	gets up and looks around and realizes she definitely isn't 	where she should be.					CHRIS			Did they get your credit chips... 			your I.D.?					DAX				(playing along)			Looks like they got everything.	She checks for her combadge and is relieved to find it's 	still there.					DAX			Except my brooch.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT ONE     10.12   CONTINUED:					CHRIS			Where do you live?  Can you get home 			okay?					DAX			I just got here.  I was traveling 			with some friends... we got 			separated...					CHRIS				(concerned)			Well you shouldn't be walking around 			without I.D.				(makes a decision)			You'd better order replacements.					CHRIS				(trying to be helpful)			You can use my Interface terminal if 			you want.  My office is right around 			the corner.					DAX			That's very kind of you...	Dax trails off.  She doesn't know his name.					CHRIS			Chris.  Chris Brynner.					DAX			I'm Jadzia.					CHRIS			Pretty name.  What is it, Dutch?					DAX			Something like that.				(a beat)			Thanks for the help.					CHRIS			Don't mention it.  It's not everyday 			I get to rescue a damsel in distress.	And as they walk away down the street...									CUT TO:      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT ONE     11.13   INT. DEFIANT - TRANSPORTER ROOM	O'Brien and an N.D. crewmember are working on the transporter 	equipment.					O'BRIEN			Check the Heisenberg compensators.  			I'll run a level-one diagnostic of 			the pattern buffer, see if there's 			any kind of field imbalance.	The N.D. nods and exits.  O'Brien immediately begins running 	tests on the transporter controls.  Kira ENTERS.					KIRA			Chief.					O'BRIEN				(still working)			Any news from Starfleet?					KIRA			Nothing good.  As far as they can 			tell, Commander Sisko and the others 			never materialized in San Francisco.  			According to their sensors, our 			transporter signal disintegrated 			immediately after we began the beam 			out sequence.					O'BRIEN				(still working)			That doesn't agree with our records.  			The system log shows that the 			transport was completed successfully.  			They definitely materialized 			somewhere.					KIRA			That's good news, anyway.  The 			question is... where?					O'BRIEN			I wish I knew.  Whatever the answer 			is, it's not in the log.  The only 			thing unusual it recorded was the 			variance in the annular confinement 			beam...					KIRA			But you corrected for that..      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT ONE     12.13   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(still working)			It was a simple adjustment.  The 			beam was just reacting to the 			accumulation of chroniton particles 			in the ship's hull.					KIRA			Chroniton particles?					O'BRIEN				(still at work)			They're emitted by the cloaking 			device.  Sometimes they become lodged 			in the ship's ablative armor matrix.					KIRA			But we've used the transporter many 			times since the cloaking device was 			installed.  There's never been a 			problem before.					O'BRIEN			And I don't know why it would be a 			problem now.	O'Brien sees something on the transporter control readouts 	that puzzles him.					O'BRIEN			Wait a minute.				(a beat)			It looks like there was a surge of 			temporal energy a few seconds before 			the initiation of the transporter 			sequence.					KIRA				(hopeful)			Tell me that's a clue.					O'BRIEN			It's a clue all right.  I'm just not 			sure what it means yet.14   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SANCTUARY DISTRICT GATE -	DAY #1 	Sisko and Bashir are now standing in front of an 	imposing wall that separates two areas of the city.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT ONE     13.14   CONTINUED:	There's a gate in the wall to let in pedestrians.  Vin is 	logging in with the Security District Police Officer who's 	manning the gate while Bernardo keeps an eye on Sisko and 	Bashir.					BASHIR				(to Sisko)			How do you feel?					SISKO			Better.					BASHIR			Me too.  Probably transporter shock.  			Disorienting, but it wears off 			quickly.				(a beat)			At least I know one thing... we're 			definitely in San Francisco.  I caught 			a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge 			a few blocks back.					SISKO				(nods)			I saw it too.	Bashir's hand unconsciously goes to his chest, where his 	combadge would be.					BASHIR			Any idea what happened to our 			combadges?					SISKO			They must've been stolen when we 			were unconscious.	Off Bashir's reaction as he realizes that's probably what 	happened.					SISKO			This isn't the Earth we're used to, 			Doctor.  That's still at least a 			century away.				(worried)			I wish I knew what happened to Dax.					BASHIR			She was in the transporter beam with 			us.  Whatever affected us must've 			affected her too.					SISKO			That means she's probably somewhere 			nearby.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT ONE     14.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO				(a beat)			As soon as we get a chance, we've 			got to find her.					BASHIR			And then what?	What Bashir's really asking is how do we get out of this.  	Sisko doesn't have an answer, but he has the quiet confidence 	to know that given time, he'll find one.					SISKO			And then... we find a way home.	Vin finishes his business at the gate and signals Bernardo.  	Bernardo glances at his watch, and frowns.  He gestures for 	Sisko and Bashir to walk toward the gate.					BERNARDO				(to Sisko and Bashir)			Okay, let's go.  Hurry it up.				(to himself)			Sonya's gonna kill me.	The cops escort Sisko and Bashir through the Pedestrian Gate 	and into...15   EXT. SANCTUARY DISTRICT "A" - STREET - DAY #1	(OPTICAL)	Sisko and Bashir ENTER a street lined by dirty, 	dilapidated buildings, with boarded up windows and 	impromptu campsites set up in the doorways and 	stairwells.  It's a sharp contrast to the relatively 	clean city outside.  The street is crowded with poorly 	dressed homeless men, women, and children, of all ages 	and races, many standing in a long food line.	Once they're through the gate, Bernardo pulls Vin aside to 	try to convince Vin to finish processing Sisko and Bashir 	without his help.  This exchange takes place in the background 	and we don't have to hear it.16   ANGLE ON SISKO AND BASHIR	As they react to the utter poverty that surrounds them.					BASHIR			What is this place?      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/20/94 - ACT ONE     15.16   CONTINUED:					SISKO			A Sanctuary District.	Bashir looks questioningly at Sisko.  The term means nothing 	to him.					BASHIR			I'm afraid twenty-first century 			history isn't one of my strong suits.  			Too depressing.					SISKO			It's always been a hobby of mine.  			They made some ugly mistakes, but 			they also paved the way for a lot of 			the things we take for granted.					BASHIR			I assume this was one of the mistakes.					SISKO			A bad one.  By the early twenty-			twenties there was a place like this 			in every major city in the United 			States.					BASHIR			But why are these people in here?  			Are they criminals?					SISKO			No.  People with criminal records 			weren't allowed in the Sanctuary 			Districts.					BASHIR			Then what did they do to deserve 			this?					SISKO			Nothing.  They're just people.  People 			without jobs or places to live.					BASHIR				(shocked)			So they get put in here?					SISKO			Welcome to the twenty-first century.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

Instead, the desk and each position at the 	conference table is equipped with a 	videophone/computer/television that allows the user to access 	the Interface.18   INCLUDE DAX (VPB)	Who's working at an additional Interface terminal in a sitting 	area by the window.  Several half empty boxes of Chinese 	take-out are scattered around a nearby coffee table.  Dax 	operates the computer by means of an electronic stylus, 	touching controls on the screen itself to enter commands, 	open files, etc.19   NEW ANGLE	As Chris ENTERS the office.					CHRIS			Sorry to keep you waiting.  Were you 			able to order new I.D.?	Dax taps in a few last commands with the stylus.					DAX			Just finished.  It took a little 			while to convince them I was who I 			said I was.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/25/94 - ACT TWO     18.19   CONTINUED:					DAX			They'll be expressing me a new transit 			pass and a couple of credit chips in 			a few hours.  I asked them to send 			it here.  I hope you don't mind.					CHRIS			No problem.					DAX			Thanks... for letting me use your 			terminal... and your account.	Dax takes a credit chip out of the computer and hands it to 	Chris.  Chris just smiles and takes the chip.  He's staring 	at Dax's head.					CHRIS			Glad I could help.				(re: her Trill markings)			You know... those are really... 			unusual.					DAX			You mean...				(covering)			My tattoos?					CHRIS			It's amazing work.  Where'd you get 			them done... Japan?					DAX				(playing along)			How'd you guess?					CHRIS			I used to have one myself.  A Maori 			tribal pattern.  All the way down my 			arm.  Got it in high school... back 			in the nineties... just like everybody 			else.				(frowns)			But I had to have it removed.  You 			know how it is.  To get the government 			contracts, you have to look just 			like the rest of the drones.				(down)			I guess that makes me a sell-out.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/25/94 - ACT TWO     19.19   CONTINUED:	(2)	Dax isn't following every word of this, but she gets the 	gist of it.					DAX			Not necessarily.  What kind of 			business do you do?					CHRIS			You don't know?				(Dax shakes her head)			I've got to talk to my public 			relations people.				(gestures to the 				computer)			I'm Chris Brynner... of Brynner 			Information Systems.  You know... 			Interface Operations... Net Access... 			Channel Ninety...	Dax can tell this is supposed to mean something, so she fakes 	familiarity.					DAX			You're that Chris Brynner?	Chris smiles.  He's glad she knows who he is after all.					CHRIS			So what do you think?  Am I a sell-			out or not?					DAX			Probably.  But I won't hold it against 			you.					CHRIS			So, these friends you told me about... 			Is there any way you can get a hold 			of them?					DAX			I wish I could.	Though Dax is trying to keep up a carefree front, this time 	the worry shows through.20   INT. PROCESSING CENTER - DAY #1	We come in CLOSE on Sisko's hand as it is scanned by a Xerox 	machine-like computer scanner.	PULL BACK TO REVEAL:      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/20/94 - ACT TWO     20.21   SISKO AND BASHIR	Getting the twenty-first century equivalent of fingerprints 	and mug shots.  They're in the Processing Center, the 	administrative headquarters of Sanctuary District "A."  It's 	a converted DMV office, and it's even more understaffed now 	than it was then.					VIN			Other hand.	Sisko holds out his other hand.  Vin grabs it and uses the 	scanner to enter his prints into the computer.22   INCLUDE THE MONITOR (VPB)	Of a twenty-first century computer, very similar in design 	to the one's in Brynner's office.  Right now the Monitor is 	displaying Sisko's handprints.  Vin enters some commands 	with his electronic stylus.  The computer responds verbally.  	When it speaks, it's with a different voice than the computers 	we're used to.  It's more artificial sounding and possibly 	male.					INTERFACE VOICE			Welcome to SafeTech's fingerprint 			database.  your government discount 			has been accepted.  Remember our new 			retinal scan services, now accessible 			on Channel One-Seventy-Eight.					VIN				(to himself)			Yeah, yeah.  Save the commercials.	Vin taps in a series of commands.					INTERFACE VOICE			We're sorry... but the fingerprints 			you have provided are not on record.					VIN			No I.D., no fingerprint records, no 			Interface account.  It's like you 			two don't exist.					BASHIR			Since we don't exist, why not let us 			go?      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT TWO     21.22   CONTINUED:					VIN			Let's see, you don't have any I.D., 			you don't have any money, and you're 			both dressed like clowns.  You figure 			it out.	Vin takes out two clipboards and attaches a stack of forms 	to each one.  He hands them to Sisko and Bashir.					VIN				(reciting from memory)			"Please fill out these forms.  Answer 			all the questions to the best of 			your ability.  If you cannot speak 			English an interpreter will be 			provided.  If you cannot read, the 			questions can be given verbally.  If 			there is any part of this form you 			do not understand, please ask one of 			our staff for assistance."				(a beat)			Now sit down, shut up, and fill out 			the forms.  And if you've got any 			problems, don't come to me with them.	Sisko and Bashir exchange a look.  This is definitely not 	what they're used to.23   INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE	O'Brien ENTERS the bridge and finds Kira standing by the 	Conn, talking to an N.D.					KIRA			Tell Admiral Ngomo I appreciate her 			offer, but I don't want anyone beaming 			onto this ship until we know what's 			going on.  If they want to come up 			by shuttle, that's fine.					O'BRIEN				(excited)			Major.	Kira turns toward O'Brien.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT TWO     22.23   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			I think I know what happened to 			Commander Sisko and the others.  The 			temporal surge we detected was caused 			by the explosion of a microscopic 			singularity  passing through this 			solar system.  Somehow, the energy 			emitted by the singularity shifted 			the chroniton particles in our hull 			into a high state of temporal 			polarization.					KIRA			Which means what?					O'BRIEN			Which means that the transporter 			beam was redirected when it passed 			through the polarized particles.					KIRA			Redirected where?					O'BRIEN			Not "where."  When.  The beam was 			redirected through time, not space.  			They arrived in San Francisco, just 			like they were supposed to...					KIRA			But not when they were supposed to.  			How much time are we talking about?  			Days?  Weeks?					O'BRIEN			More like centuries.	As Kira reacts to this...24   INT. PROCESSING CENTER - DAY #1	Sisko is sitting on a bench with several homeless men and 	women.  All the other people in his area of the Processing 	Center seem to be mentally ill in one way or other.  The 	bench is part of a line which stretches out the door.  Sisko 	is waiting patiently, filling out some kind of form, but 	Bashir is at the front of the line, complaining to Vin, who 	is still on duty...      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT TWO     23.24   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			This is ridiculous.  We've been 			waiting here for three hours and the 			line's barely moved at all.	Vin cradles his shotgun in his arms and leans against the 	wall in a relaxed position.  But in spite of his relaxed 	pose, he's a professional, constantly scanning the room for 	signs of trouble.					VIN			I got one word for you pal... plenty 			of overtime.					BASHIR			That's three words.					VIN			Hey, for a dim, you're pretty smart.  			Now get back in line.	While Bashir and Vin are talking, something catches Sisko's 	eye.  It's a digital WALL CALENDAR displaying the date "8-30-	24." Sisko looks at the calendar for a long beat, then looks 	outside.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT TWO     24.25   NEW ANGLE	As Bashir joins Sisko.					BASHIR				(quietly; re: the 				Dims)			Commander, these people are mentally 			ill.  They need proper medical 			treatment.					SISKO			I know.  But they're not going to 			get it.  Not now anyway.	Bashir picks up on Sisko's mood.					BASHIR			What is it?					SISKO			That calendar over there... It says 			today is August thirtieth, twenty-			twenty-four.					BASHIR			I'm not sure what you...					SISKO				(cuts him off)			Ever hear of the Bell Riots?					BASHIR				(thinking)			Vaguely.	Sisko nods.  He wasn't really expecting Bashir to recognize 	the name.      DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT TWO     25.25   CONTINUED:					SISKO			It was one of the most violent civil 			disturbances in American history.  			And it happened right here.  San 			Francisco, Sanctuary District "A," 			the first week of September, twenty-			twenty-four.					BASHIR			That's only a few days from now.					SISKO			Which means if we don't get out of 			here soon, we're going to be caught 			right in the middle of it.	And as Bashir reacts to Sisko's news, we...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT TWO                               DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

PROCESSING CENTER - CONTINUOUS	Bashir looks around at all the people waiting in the 	Processing Center.					BASHIR				(to Sisko, quietly)			So just how bad is this riot going 			to be, Commander?					SISKO			Bad.  The Sanctuary residents will 			take over the District.  Some of the 			guards will be taken hostage.  In 			the end, the government will send in 			troops to restore order.  Hundreds 			of Sanctuary residents will be killed.					BASHIR				(shocked)			Hundreds.				(shakes his head)			And there's nothing we can do to 			prevent it.	It's a statement of fact, not a question.  Bashir shakes his 	head grimly.					BASHIR				(continues)			Starfleet's temporal displacement 			policy may sound good in a classroom.  			But to know that hundreds of people 			are going to die, and not to be 			allowed to even try to save them...					SISKO			I sympathize, Doctor.  But if it 			makes you feel any better, the Riots 			will be one of the watershed events 			of the twenty-first century.				(a beat)			Gabriel Bell will see to that.					BASHIR			Bell?     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT THREE    27.26   CONTINUED:					SISKO				(nods)			The man they named the Riots after.  			He was one of the Sanctuary residents 			who'll be guarding the hostages.  			The government troops will storm 			this place, based on rumors that the 			hostages have been killed.				(a beat)			But it'll turn out that the hostages 			were never harmed.  Because of Gabriel 			Bell.  In the end, Bell will sacrifice 			his own life to save them.  He'll 			become a national hero.  Outrage 			over his death, and the death of the 			other residents, will change public 			opinion about the Sanctuaries.  			They'll be torn down and the United 			States will finally begin correcting 			the social problems it had struggled 			with for over a hundred years.					BASHIR			All because of what's going to happen 			here in a few days.					SISKO			Which means if we warn these people 			about what's coming, if we try to 			help them in any way, we risk altering 			a pivotal moment in history.  And we 			can't let that happen.	As much as he doesn't like it, Bashir knows Sisko is right.27   NEW ANGLE	As Vin notices something off camera.					VIN				(to Sisko and Bashir)			Hey, I hate to break up this intimate 			conversation, but you're next.28   INT. PROCESSING CENTER - LEE'S CUBICLE - DAY #1	Sisko and Bashir are being interviewed by a Public Health 	official in a small semi-private cubicle. DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT THREE 28-29.    28   CONTINUED:	LEE, the official, is well-meaning, but underpaid, 	undersupported, and overworked.  Unlike Chris, she's still 	using paper.  Her desk is covered with the stuff.	Lee studies both of them.					SISKO			Is something wrong?					LEE			Well, according to these forms, you're 			supposed to be dims.  But you're 			not, are you?					SISKO			I hope you're not disappointed.					LEE			Pleasantly surprised is more like 			it.				(a beat)			I guess I owe you an apology.  If 			I'd known you were gimmies, I could've 			processed your application much 			sooner.					BASHIR			Gimmies?					SISKO			They're American slang terms.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT THREE    30.28   CONTINUED:	(2)					LEE				(embarrassed)			I try not to use them, but it's a 			bad habit.				(to Bashir)			Gimmies are people like you... people 			looking for help... a job, a place 			to live.					BASHIR			And what about the dims... Don't 			they need help?					LEE			The dims should be in hospitals.  			But the government can't afford to 			keep them there, so we get them 			instead.				(a beat)			I don't like it, but that's the way 			it is.				(consults forms)			I see here that you both just arrived 			in San Francisco.  Do you have any 			jobs lined up?					BASHIR			No.  We weren't really planning on 			being here that long.					LEE			Have you got a place to stay?  Or 			anyone who can vouch for you?					SISKO			We were traveling with a friend... 			but we were separated right after we 			arrived.					LEE			Do you have any way of contacting 			this friend of yours?					SISKO			Not at the moment.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT THREE    31.28   CONTINUED:	(3)					LEE			In that case, I'm afraid you'll have 			to stay here in the Sanctuary for 			the time being.					BASHIR			You mean we can't leave?					LEE			It's for your own safety.					SISKO				(skeptical)			Really.					LEE			And it's the law.					SISKO			And what about jobs?  How are we 			supposed to find work and a place to 			stay if we're stuck in here?					LEE			One of the services we provide is 			job placement.					SISKO			And how long does that usually take?	Lee looks very uncomfortable.					LEE			I wish I could give you a definite 			answer.  But right now jobs are hard 			to come by... what with the economy 			and all...				(a beat)			My advice is to be patient.	There's an awkward silence, then Lee takes two plastic cards 	out of her desk.  She gives one to each of them.					LEE			In the meantime, take these.				(they take the cards)			They're your ration cards.  You can 			use them to get food and water at 			any of the distribution points in 			the district.  Hang on to them.					BASHIR			And where are we supposed to stay 			while we're here?     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT THREE    32.28   CONTINUED:	(4)					LEE			Anywhere you like.  The buildings in 			the district are there for everyone 			to use.	In other words, they're on their own.					SISKO			Thanks for all your help.	Sisko and Bashir head for the door.					LEE			One more thing... a little advice.  			Stay away from District Security.  			They've had their budget cut again.  			They're overworked and underpaid...				(trails off)			Just give them a lot of space.				(a beat)			And watch out for ghosts.					BASHIR			Ghosts?					LEE			That's what we call people who haven't 			integrated well into the Sanctuary.  			They can be dangerous; they tend to 			prey on other residents.					SISKO				(means it this time)			Thanks for the warning.  We'll stay 			out of their way.	Sisko and Bashir EXIT.  Lee watches them go.  She feels for 	them, but she tries not to let it get to her.29   INT. CHRIS'S OFFICE - NIGHT #1	Dax is alone in Chris's office.  She's trying to contact 	Sisko and Bashir over her combadge.  From her expression, it 	appears she's been at it for a while.					DAX			Dax to Sisko... Dax to Bashir... If 			you can hear me, please respond...	There's no answer.  Chris ENTERS.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT THREE    33.29   CONTINUED:					CHRIS			Okay, my assistant was able to get 			you a room at the Clift for the next 			five nights.					DAX			You didn't have to do that.					CHRIS				(smiles)			I know.  But I wanted to.				(a beat)			So what are your plans?					DAX			I still have to find my friends.					CHRIS			Well, I hope you don't mind, but I 			had Britt do some checking.  No one 			matching their descriptions has been 			admitted into any of the City's 			hospitals or trauma wards.					DAX			That's good news.	There's an awkward beat between them.					CHRIS			Look, I'd like to know how this all 			turns out.  I'm having a little get-			together tomorrow, here in the office.  			You're welcome to come if you want... 			you and your friends.					DAX			I'd like that.	Dax starts getting ready to leave.					CHRIS			Well, good luck.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

SANCTUARY DISTRICT "A" APARTMENT BUILDING -	NIGHT #1	Sisko and Bashir walk up the stairs toward a tenement 	style apartment building.  Their way is blocked at the 	top of the stairs by three burly-looking homeless men.  	These are gimmies, people just trying to protect their 	families and friends inside the building.					STAIRWAY GUARD			You can't come in here.					BASHIR			We're just looking for someplace to 			sleep.					STAIRWAY GUARD			Look someplace else.	From Bashir's expression, it's evident they've run into this 	response more than once today.					BASHIR			Let me guess.  This building's full.					STAIRWAY GUARD			Sorry.	Bashir looks back at Sisko.  He doesn't want to back down, 	but he knows he shouldn't push it.31   NEW ANGLE	As the two of them head off down the street together.  The 	street is poorly lit and poorly maintained.  People are 	sleeping in doorways, stairwells, any place they can find 	shelter from the cold.	They walk by several people camped in a doorway.  One of 	them, an African American about Sisko's size and age, nods a 	wordless greeting.  Though there's no way they can know it, 	this is GABRIEL BELL.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 11/01/94 - ACT THREE    35.31   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Every building we go to, it's the 			same story.  They can't all be full.					SISKO			Don't be so sure.  One of the main 			complaints against the Sanctuary 			Districts was overcrowding.  It got 			to the point where they didn't care 			how many people were in here.  They 			just wanted to keep them out of sight.	Bashir and Sisko walk by a dim, who is sitting on a curb, 	gently rocking back and forth.  Bashir glances at the dim 	and shakes his head.					BASHIR			And once they were out of sight, 			what then?				(re: the Dim)			Look at him.  There's no need for 			that man to live like that.  With 			the right medication, he could lead 			a full and normal life.					SISKO			Maybe in our time...					BASHIR			Not just in our time.  There were 			any number of effective treatments 			for schizophrenia, even in this day 			and age.  They could cure that man 			now... today... if they gave a damn.					SISKO			It's not that they don't give a damn, 			Doctor.  It's that they've given up.  			The social problems facing them seem 			too enormous to deal with.					BASHIR			That only makes it worse.  Causing 			people to suffer because you hate 			them is terrible... but causing them 			to suffer because you've forgotten 			how to care... that's even harder to 			understand.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 11/01/94 - ACT THREE   35A.31   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			They'll remember.  It'll take 			time, and it won't be easy, but 			eventually people in this century 			will remember how to care.					BASHIR			But it makes you wonder, doesn't it?  			Are humans really any different than 			Cardassians... or Romulans?  If push 			came to shove, if something disastrous 			happened to the Federation, and we 			got frightened enough, or desperate 			enough, how would we react?  Would 			we stay true to our ideals... or 			would we just end up... here... right 			back where we started?					SISKO			I don't know.  But as a Starfleet 			officer, it's my job to make sure we 			never have to find out.	They round the corner and come upon a group of GHOSTS, who 	are in the middle of beating up on a confused-looking dim.  	The ghosts are tough-looking and better fed and dressed than 	the rest of the people on the street, the top of the food 	chain.  They throw the dim to the pavement.	B.C., the leader of this particular group of Ghosts, is a 	wiry, tightly wound man in his late twenties.						B.C.					(to another ghost)			Get his food card.	The dim, who's had the wind knocked out of him by the fall, 	tries to huddle up and protect himself.32   ANGLE ON SISKO AND BASHIR	Looking in shock and revulsion at what's going on.  Sisko 	can tell that Bashir wants to intervene, but holds him back 	with a look.					SISKO				(sotto voice)			Remember, Doctor, we can't interfere.	B.C. looks over and sees the look on Bashir's face.					B.C.			You got a problem?     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/27/94 - ACT THREE    36.32   CONTINUED:					SISKO			No problem.					B.C.			You look upset.				(with mock apology)			If we've offended you in any way, 			please tell us so we can be sure not 			to do it again.					SISKO			Don't worry about us.  We're new 			here.					B.C.			I never would've guessed.  Let me 			be the first to welcome you.	He tips his hat.					B.C.				(re: the dim)			Would you like a piece of this?					BASHIR			No thanks.					B.C.				(to his colleagues)			Gimmies... no sense of fun.					SISKO			We're just looking for a place to 			sleep.					B.C.			In that case, you better look 			somewhere else... newboy.					SISKO				(to Bashir)			You heard him.  Let's go.	Sisko and Bashir back away.					B.C.				(calling after them)			Enjoy your stay... in a few days 			you'll feel right at home.	One of the other ghosts rummages through the dim's clothing 	and takes his food card.  The street scene is eerie and 	nightmarish.  And despite the dim's whimpers, no one moves 	to help him.									FADE OUT.                       END OF ACT THREE                              DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

But we 			only have enough polarized chronitons 			to make five or six attempts.					KIRA			We'll have to take our chances.  			Pick the most likely time periods 			and send a team down with tricorders 			to find them.				(she smiles)			The hard part will be finding a couple 			of volunteers crazy enough to risk 			getting lost in time to do the job.	O'Brien looks at Kira.					O'BRIEN				(smiles)			I think I know some likely candidates.	Odo looks back and forth between the two of them.34   EXT. SANCTUARY DISTRICT "A" - DAY #2	Bashir's asleep on the sidewalk, huddled up against the wall.  	Sisko gently shakes his shoulder and wakes him up.	Bashir gets up with a groan.

SANCTUARY DISTRICT "A" APARTMENT BUILDING -	DAY #2	Sisko and Bashir return to the building where they were 	turned away the night before.  There's a new group of 	guards on the stairs, but the guards from the night 	before are sitting nearby, eating their breakfasts.  	The head Stairway Guard spots Sisko and Bashir 	approaching the building.					STAIRWAY GUARD			Not you two again.  I told you, we 			don't have any room.					SISKO			We're not looking to stay.  All we 			want is to go up on the roof and 			take a look around.					STAIRWAY GUARD			It doesn't matter what you want.  			You can't come in.  We've got to 			protect what's ours.					BASHIR			Look, maybe we can make a deal.  			Isn't there something we can trade 			to get access to your building?					STAIRWAY GUARD			I don't know.  What do you have to 			offer?	There's a beat as Sisko and Bashir realize they don't really 	have anything.					STAIRWAY GUARD				(continuing)			That's what I thought.  Maybe you 			should try another building.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT FOUR     39.35   CONTINUED:	Bashir and Sisko start to leave, but one of his companions 	whispers something to the Stairway Guard, who calls after 	them.					STAIRWAY GUARD			Hey, wait a minute.				(they turn back)			Maybe we can make a deal after all.36   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY #2	Sisko and Bashir picking their way through an ill-lit hallway 	inside the tenement building.  Neither one of them is wearing 	their uniform anymore.  They're exchanged clothing with the 	stairway guards outside.					SISKO				(re: the clothes)			Well at least now we look like we 			belong here.					BASHIR			Yeah, and we smell just as bad as 			everyone else.	Sisko smiles at Bashir's attempt to make light of their 	situation.					SISKO			The stairwell must be around here 			somewhere.	They round a corner and...37   NEW ANGLE	... and run into a homeless man (WEBB) tending to an injured 	teenage boy (DANNY).  But as soon as he catches a glimpse of 	Sisko and Bashir in the darkened hallway, Webb spins around 	and points a knife at them.					WEBB			Stay away from him.					SISKO			Whatever you say.  Just put the knife 			down.	Webb is a man in his mid-forties.  He's a gimmie who still 	has hope that things will get better.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT FOUR     40.37   CONTINUED:	He tries to make himself look presentable; his clothes 	are wrinkled but basically clean.  He's clean shaven and his 	hair looks messy, but clean.  There's something solid and 	reassuringly middle-class about him, the kind of guy you'd 	want on your side.  He studies Bashir and Sisko for a beat, 	then...					WEBB			Step into the light.  So I can see 			you.	Bashir steps forward into a beam of light.  Webb sees his 	face and relaxes a little.					SISKO			We're new here.  We're just trying 			to get up to the roof... get a better 			look at this place.					WEBB			Believe me, it doesn't look any better 			from up there.	The teenage boy feels a twinge and moans.					DANNY				(weak)			Dad...	Webb decides he can trust Sisko and Bashir.  He puts away 	the knife and goes to tend to his son.					WEBB			It's going to be okay...38   CLOSE ON BASHIR	As he watches Webb try to make his son more comfortable.					BASHIR			What happened?					WEBB			He got beaten up by some ghosts.	Bashir kneels down next to the boy.  Danny's shirt is cut up 	and bloody.					WEBB				(continuing)			My wife went to get help, but there's 			only one doctor on duty at the 			Processing Center.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

Bashir returns to 	Danny's side.  He carefully unbuttons and pulls aside the 	boy's blood-soaked shirt, then examines the wounds.					BASHIR			Looks like you were lucky.  No broken 			ribs and these cuts are mostly 			superficial.  You're going to be 			okay.				(to Webb)			You're going to need some clean rags 			and something to disinfect the wounds.  			Alcohol will do.	Webb nods gratefully.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

Webb 	follows them out.					WEBB			You know, the District could use 			another doctor.					BASHIR			I don't really practice anymore.					WEBB			But there are people here who need 			you.					BASHIR			I'm sorry.  They'll have to get along 			without me.	Webb looks disappointed.					WEBB			I know you two are new here, so let 			me explain something to you.  You 			can forget about getting out of here 			any time soon.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt. I" - REV. 10/19/94 - ACT FOUR     43.39   CONTINUED:					WEBB (Cont'd)			This is your home now.  The only 			help we're going to get is from each 			other.  If we don't start pulling 			together, we're finished.					SISKO			All we want is to be left alone.					WEBB			My mistake.  I thought you wanted to 			get out of here.					BASHIR			We do.					WEBB			Well the only way that's going to 			happen is for us to get organized 			and let people on the outside know 			what's going on in here.					SISKO			Do whatever you want.  But leave us 			out of it.					WEBB			If you want to be left alone, that's 			fine with me.  But if you want to 			help us, and help yourselves, you 			know where to find me.	Webb turns and walks away.  Sisko and Bashir exchange a look.  	They know Webb is a good man, and they want to help, but 	their hands are tied.40   INT. CHRIS'S OFFICE - DAY #2	Chris is hosting a cocktail party/sales presentation for 	some of his more important clients.  His office is full of 	PARTY GUESTS, well-dressed corporate bigwigs and their 	significant others.	Dax is standing off to one side, watching the crowd.  She's 	wearing new twenty-first century clothing, but she's still 	got her combadge on.					MALE GUEST			Our sea floor mining project is almost 			ready to go into operation.	The Pan-Caribbean government had some misgivings, but I think 	we've won them over.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

Everything.	Dax nods.					DAX			Chris came to my rescue.  He let me 			use his computer to get replacement 			I.D.					MALE GUEST			You're lucky the police didn't find 			you first.  If they'd caught you on 			the street without I.D., you might've 			ended up in a Sanctuary District.					FEMALE GUEST			I thought they stopped doing that.					MALE GUEST			Why would they?  It's the only way 			to keep those people off the streets.	During the above exchange, Dax takes Chris's arm.					DAX			Excuse us for just a minute.	The Guests nod politely and Dax leads Chris away.41   ANGLE ON DAX AND CHRIS	As they talk in private.					DAX			Is that true?     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

SANCTUARY DISTRICT "A" - NIGHT #2	Sisko and Bashir are in line for food with a number of other 	District Residents.  Both of them look cold, hungry, and 	miserable.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

A 	group of ghosts approach him from behind.  It's B.C. and his 	friends.	B.C.	Hey, gimmie.	Bashir, who has no idea they're talking to him, continues 	warming his hands.  B.C. grabs him by the shoulder and turns 	him around.					B.C.			I'm talking to you, gimmie.	Bashir looks down at B.C.'s hand on his shoulder.        DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

Bashir 	goes to Sisko's defense, and soon the two of them are fighting 	B.C. and four of his ghost flunkies.	The crowd in the line scatters.  Though Sisko and Bashir are 	far better fighters than B.C. and his men had anticipated, 	numbers tell, and Sisko and Bashir are soon in trouble.	But to everyone's surprise, one of the bystanders weighs in 	on Sisko and Bashir's side, decking a ghost who is trying to 	strangle Bashir.  It's Gabriel Bell.					BELL			Leave them alone.	Bell, who is a large, strong man, turns the tide, and it 	looks like Sisko and Bashir are going to be okay, when...     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

But to B.C.'s 	surprise...47   BASHIR	Kicks the knife out of his hands.48   NEW ANGLE	As the shiv slides across the street, Sisko finishes off his 	opponent.  B.C. sees that the tide is turning against him.  	He signals his friends and B.C. and the other ghosts retreat.  	Bashir goes to help Bell, then hesitates for a beat, and 	looks up at Sisko.					SISKO				(urgent)			Help him.  He wouldn't have gotten 			hurt if it wasn't for us.	Bashir begins CPR.  But he isn't having much success.					BASHIR			Breathe, damn you.  Breathe.	Bashir works hard to revive Bell, but he knows it's no use 	and eventually stops.  Bashir looks at Sisko and shakes his 	head.					BASHIR			He's gone.	Sisko sees Bell's discarded food card, which the ghost dropped 	in his hasty retreat, and picks it up.  He reacts at what he 	sees.	In the distance, we can hear the cops getting closer.					SISKO			Come on.  We've got to get out of 			here.	But Bashir is still stunned by Bell's unexpected death.     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.

It looks like 			Starfleet's changed our minds for 			us.				(off Kira's reaction)			I just got a message from Admiral 			Wright of Starfleet Command.  			Headquarters thinks our plan's too 			risky.  They're afraid that while 			we're searching for Sisko and the 			others, we might contaminate the 			timeline.					KIRA			Get me Admiral Wright.					O'BRIEN				(smiles)			I had a feeling you'd say that.	O'Brien goes to the console and taps in some commands.					O'BRIEN			That's odd.					KIRA			What is it?     DEEP SPACE: "Past Tense, Pt.
