SISKO'S QUARTERS	JAKE sits hunched over a table on which sit three pots, each 	containing a small, newly sprouted plant with a bulbous base.  	Jake is carefully watering each plant as the door opens and 	SISKO ENTERS.					SISKO			Hey, Jake.				(re: the plants)			What's all this?					JAKE			My science project.  I'm growing 			Bajoran katterpods to find out which 			hybrid yields the biggest root.					SISKO				(puzzled)			That's it?  You're just going to 			watch them grow?					JAKE			Yeah.  Pretty neat, huh?					SISKO			Not bad... But don't you think it's 			a little...				(trying to be 				diplomatic)			Low tech.					JAKE			I'm a low tech kind of guy, dad.	Sisko can't argue with that assessment, but still feels he 	has to push his son to try something a little more ambitious.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED:					SISKO			I still think you can do something a 			little more challenging.				(encouraging him)			If you could do any science project 			you wanted... anything at all... 			what would it be?	Jake thinks about it for a moment, then gets excited.					JAKE				(knows this is a long 				shot)			Learn how to pilot a runabout?					SISKO			That's not really a science project, 			is it?  What's your second choice?					JAKE				(after a beat)			Visit the Gamma Quadrant?					SISKO				(considers it)			What would you do once you got there?					JAKE			I don't know... I could... do a 			planetary survey?					SISKO			That's not bad.				(deciding)			All right.  Let's do it.					JAKE				(surprised)			Really?					SISKO			It'll be like a vacation.				(a beat)			A working vacation.					JAKE			That's fantastic.  Thanks, Dad.  I 			bet we'll have a great time.					SISKO			I know we will.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - TEASER         3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)	And as they sit there looking forward to their trip...									CUT TO:2    INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE	Sisko is discussing station business with KIRA and DAX.					KIRA				(reading off a PADD)			Let's see, we have a Bolian freighter 			due in the day after tomorrow... 			we'll be outfitting another group of 			settlers leaving for New Bajor...				(an aside)			I hear the colony's new irrigation 			system is something to see.  When 			you get to the Gamma Quadrant, you 			should take a look.					SISKO			Not this trip.  I really want to 			spend some time alone with Jake.				(a beat)			When's the Odyssey due back from the 			Cardassian border?					KIRA				(checking PADD)			Three days.					SISKO				(amused, to Dax)			It's a shame I'll have to miss your 			reunion with Captain Keogh.					DAX				(defensive)			I'm seven times as old as Keogh, and 			he treats me like some kind of...					SISKO				(playful)			Lieutenant?					DAX			Don't you find him just a little 			arrogant?        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - TEASER         4.2    CONTINUED:					SISKO			Funny, he said the same thing about 			you.					DAX				(wryly)			Did he?					SISKO				(the final word)			He's the Captain of a Galaxy-class 			starship and I expect him to be 			treated with the courtesy he deserves.					DAX			Don't worry.  I'll be on my best 			behavior.					KIRA				(to Sisko)			You just enjoy your vacation.  I'll 			keep everyone out of trouble until 			you get back.	Sisko has every confidence in his first officer.					SISKO			I don't doubt it.					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE			Commander... your son's here to see 			you.					SISKO				(to com)			Send him in.				(to Dax and Kira)			He's really looking forward to this 			trip.3    NEW ANGLE	As Jake ENTERS.					JAKE			Dad, guess what... I was talking to 			Nog and it turns out that he's having 			trouble coming up with a science 			project.  So I told him he could be 			my partner.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - TEASER        4A.3    CONTINUED:	Dax and Kira stand up.  Neither one wants to sit on the 	sidelines during a family discussion.					KIRA				(smiling, to Sisko, 				re: PADD)			I think we can finish this later.	She and Dax EXIT.					SISKO				(to Jake)			Partner?					JAKE			We asked Mrs. O'Brien and she said 			it would be okay, so I invited Nog 			to come with us to the Gamma Quadrant.					SISKO			Now hold on a second, Jake...					JAKE			Dad, if Nog doesn't get a good grade 			on this science project, he's going 			to drop out of school.  And I can't 			let that happen.					SISKO			Maybe he can help you analyze the 			survey information when we get back.					JAKE			That's not enough.  Mrs. O'Brien 			said he'd have to be an equal partner.				(a beat)			Come on, Dad... he's my friend.  I 			have to help him.4    CLOSE ON SISKO	He can't say no, but this isn't going to be the trip he was 	hoping for.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - TEASER         5.5    INT. QUARK'S - SECOND LEVEL	QUARK is seated at a table beside MORN, who stares morosely 	into his drink.					QUARK			Morn, you've been sitting there all 			day, staring into the same drink.  			Talk to me.  I want to help.				(Morn says nothing)			I'm not just your bartender... I'm 			your friend.  Whatever's wrong, I'm 			here for you.	Morn looks up at Quark, places a hand on his shoulder, and 	is about to pour out his life story, when Quark spots ODO 	coming up the stairs.					QUARK				(to Morn, dismissive)			Hold that thought.	Quark hurries over to Odo.					QUARK				(anxious)			Well... what did he say?					ODO			What did who say?					QUARK			Commander Sisko.  About my idea.					ODO			You mean using the monitors to sell 			merchandise throughout the station?					QUARK				(frustrated)			Stop torturing me, Odo.  Tell me 			what he said.					ODO			Guess.					QUARK				(hopeful)			He said yes?					ODO			Guess again.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - TEASER        5A.5    CONTINUED:					QUARK			But how could he refuse?  It would 			triple my profits.	In the background Morn, tired of waiting for Quark, shuffles 	away.					ODO			Maybe it's because he doesn't like 			you.					QUARK				(dismissive)			Don't be ridiculous.  Major Kira is 			the one that doesn't like me.  			Sisko...					ODO				(finishing the sentence)			Doesn't like you either.					QUARK			What did I ever do to him?        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - TEASER         6.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO			Oh, I could think of one or two 			things.					QUARK				(dismissive)			One or two things?  That's nothing.				(more to the point)			So do you think there's any way I 			can change his mind?	Odo harumphs and EXITS.6    NEW ANGLE	As NOG approaches Quark.					NOG			Uncle Quark?					QUARK				(ignoring him)			Not now.					NOG				(trying to soft-sell 				this)			I just wanted to tell you, I'm not 			going to be able to work my shift 			for the next couple of days.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - TEASER         7.6    CONTINUED:	Quark is outraged.					QUARK			Why not?					NOG			I'm... going to the Gamma Quadrant... 			with Jake and his father.					QUARK				(surprised)			You're going to the Gamma Quadrant 			with Commander Sisko?	Quark senses an opportunity.					QUARK			How...				(getting an idea)			Lucky for you.	And as Quark throws a friendly arm around Nog...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - ACT ONE        8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)7    INT.

I know this isn't exactly 			the trip you planned on.  But you'll 			see... Nog's a great guy.					SISKO			I'm sure he is.  I was just hoping 			that you and I could spend this 			time... together.					JAKE			We will.  Don't worry.

Neither of them have any 	idea what Quark is up to.	Nog comes out from the back and sees Quark.  He's as surprised 	as anyone.					NOG			Uncle Quark... What are you doing 			here?					QUARK			What's it look like?  I'm coming 			with you.	Quark shoves his bags onto Nog.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - ACT ONE       10.10   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Since when?					QUARK				(doing some fast 				talking)			Really, Commander, you don't expect 			my nephew to go all the way to the 			Gamma Quadrant without proper 			supervision.	Quark takes Sisko aside, shooing Jake and Nog away.					QUARK				(continues)			No offense... some of my best friends 			are humans.  But my brother Rom isn't 			as... liberal as I am.  Let's face 			it... he's never been comfortable 			about Nog's friendship with your 			son.					SISKO			You can tell Rom not to worry.  I'll 			take good care of the boy.				(a beat)			And I promise I won't try to corrupt 			him with my human values.					QUARK			I know that, but Rom is convinced 			all humans look down on Ferengis.  			And by allowing me to come on this 			trip, you can help prove him wrong.				(a beat)			He is wrong, isn't he?        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - ACT ONE      10A.10   CONTINUED:	(2)	Quark smiles.  He knows he has Sisko in a bind.					JAKE			Dad, please...	A beat as Sisko looks at Jake and realizes how important 	this is to his son.  And that, more than Quark's weaseling, 	convinces Sisko.					SISKO				(to Jake, a good sport)			All right.  But let's get going before 			anyone else shows up.	Jake smiles in thanks at his dad.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - ACT ONE       11.11   EXT.

JUNGLE - DAY	Sisko, Jake, Quark and Nog walk into a small clearing.					JAKE				(looking around)			This place is great.					SISKO			Our preliminary surveys suggest it's 			a lot like Earth during the early 			Devonian period.  A lot of plant 			life, fish, some insects, but no 			predators or large land animals.  			Pretty, isn't it?					QUARK			I don't see what's so pretty about 			it.					NOG				(helpful)			I think they mean the trees and stuff.					SISKO			Look around you, Quark.  This is as 			close to paradise as you'll ever 			get.  You just have to allow yourself 			to see it.					QUARK				(professorial)			I can tell you what I see in two 			words... "exploitable resources."	Quark begins scratching at his ears.					SISKO			I suppose you'd want to cut down all 			these trees and start strip mining 			the entire planet.        DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - ACT ONE       12.13   CONTINUED:					QUARK			As a wise man once wrote...

The Orinoco 	and Mekong break away to engage the Jem'Hadar ships.	The Jem'Hadar and Federation ships exchange fire.  The more 	maneuverable runabouts avoid the Jem'Hadar weapons, but the 	Odyssey is hit and sustains damage.77A  INT. ODYSSEY - BRIDGE	The Bridge is full of smoke and fire.  Consoles are sparking, 	red alert is flashing.  It's a chaotic scene, but Keogh 	remains a stabilizing force in the center of the turmoil.	Another explosion rocks the Bridge as Keogh gets his officers 	reports.					FIRST OFFICER			I'm getting casualty reports from 			decks four, five, eight and seventeen 			and we have a plasma leak in our 			port nacelle.					KEOGH			Deploy damage control teams.				(to com)			Keogh to runabouts.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Go ahead.					KEOGH			They're using some kind of phased 			polaron beam to penetrate our shields.78   INT.

He can hide 			in the underbrush.  We'll transport 			him to safety once we get to your 			ship.					SISKO			I'm not leaving him behind.				(smiling at Quark)			We never would've gotten away from 			the Jem'Hadar without him.					QUARK				(pleased)			Thank you, Commander.				(glaring at Eris)			I'm glad someone around here 			appreciates me.	Suddenly, all three of them DEMATERIALIZE.83   INT.

I thought if I could 			replicate it, I might be able to 			turn a tidy profit.  Imagine my 			surprise when I discovered there's 			nothing in here.  It's just a 			complicated locking device.					SISKO			Which means you could've used your 			telekinetic abilities at any time.  			So the question is, why didn't you?	Eris looks at Quark with contempt, and then stares defiantly 	at Sisko.					ERIS			You seem to already know the answer.					SISKO				(he thinks he does)			The Jem'Hadar wanted us to escape, 			didn't they?  That was the plan all 			along... for us to bring you back 			here, so that you could spy on the 			Federation.					ERIS				(patronizing)			Well done, Commander.       DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - ACT FIVE       57.					SISKO			You're one of the Founders, aren't 			you?					ERIS			You think the Founders would waste 			their time with you?					SISKO			Constable...	Odo steps forward.					ODO				(to Eris)			Madam, if you'll come with us...	Eris takes one step backward from Odo and the Security guards.  	She keeps her eyes focused on Sisko.					ERIS				(to Sisko)			You have no idea what's begun here.	And with that...98   ERIS (OPTICAL)	Hits a concealed Transporter device and DEMATERIALIZES just 	like the Jem'Hadar did.99   NEW ANGLE	As everyone reacts to Eris's disappearance by going to their 	stations.       DEEP SPACE: "The Jem'Hadar" - REV. 04/22/94 - ACT FIVE       58.99   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(checking panels)			I'm picking up a transporter 			signature, but I can't trace it.  			She didn't rematerialize anywhere on 			the station and there are no ships 			nearby.					BASHIR			Then where is she?	A beat.
