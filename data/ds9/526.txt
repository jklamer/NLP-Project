Defeats 			make my wounds ache. 				(rising) 			Ah, the replacements.	FIVE KLINGONS are ENTERING the room. As they form a 	line, Martok and Worf exchange a look of disbelief.6    THE REPLACEMENTS	are TWO WHISKERLESS YOUTHS (ALEXANDER and KATOGH), TWO 	TEENAGED WOMEN (DORAN and N'GAREN) and a stoop-	shouldered OLD MAN (KOTH). Martok sucks in his 	reservations, strides toward them. With each step he 	seems to grow taller and straighter. Worf remains 	several paces behind.					MARTOK 			I am General Martok.

The recruit steps forward and 	salutes.					ALEXANDER 			Alexander Rozhenko!	Worf stands aghast, unable to believe what he sees.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Sons and...

Martok notices the emotional 	electricity crackling between the two.					MARTOK 			Rozhenko? Of what house is 			Rozhenko?					ALEXANDER 			Of no house, sir. My honor will 			be my own.	The words sting Worf. Alexander stares straight ahead 	without expression.					MARTOK 			Well, there will be much honor for 			the taking on this ship -- enough 			for all of you.

Several Klingons begin to 	snicker.					CH'TARGH			Please.	Alexander takes the proffered chair and Ch'Targh sits 	down next to him. As Alexander sets his plate on the 	table, Ch'Targh inspects it and announces...					CH'TARGH			Bregit lung. An excellent choice.	Like kids in a schoolyard, Klingons at other tables 	stop their conversations and eagerly turn to watch the 	sport. Ch'Targh reaches across several messmates to 	grab a dull metallic bottle, obsequiously uncaps it and 	offers it to Alexander.					CH'TARGH			Would you care for some grapok			sauce?	A few OUTRIGHT LAUGHS come from nearby, then quickly 	stop. Puzzled, Alexander looks over, then suspiciously 	regards Ch'Targh.					ALEXANDER			No thank you.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Sons and...

She just shakes 	her head. Before Alexander can react, Ch'Targh engages 	him again.					CH'TARGH 			Or perhaps the son of our 			illustrious first officer would 			prefer an Earth beverage. A glass 			of root beer, with a lump of "ice 			cream?"	This is too much for the Klingons. They fall off their 	chairs and pound the table, howling with laughter.					ALEXANDER				(rising anger) 			Are you mocking me?					CH'TARGH 			Now why would I mock you, Son of 			Worf?					ALEXANDER 			I am called Rozhenko.					CH'TARGH				(smile fading) 			I will call you whatever I please. 			And you will learn to like it.	Alexander jumps to his feet, trembling with rage.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Sons and... " - REV. 7/31/97 - ACT TWO      28.26   CH'TARGH - CLOSE - ALEXANDER'S POV	His mocking face leers.					CH'TARGH 			Does the son of Starfleet's finest 			think he is too good to eat with 			us?					ALEXANDER 			No. Have some lung.	Alexander heaves his plate of food into Ch'Targh's 	face. ROARS OF LAUGHTER echo through the hall. 	Alexander smiles. Enraged, Ch'Targh wipes the food 	from his face, rises to his full imposing height, and 	tosses his chair aside.					CH'TARGH 			I do not like your smile. Perhaps 			I will cut you a new one.	Shaking with fear, rage and adrenalin, Alexander draws 	his ceremonial dagger. Ch'Targh draws his own...27   D'H TAHG	Its secondary blades spring into place.28   ALEXANDER AND CH'TARGH	Circle each other slowly. Alexander is quicker, but 	Ch'Targh is grounded and moves with a grace unusual in 	a big man. The rest of the Klingons gather around to 	watch, egging them on.	Alexander thrusts awkwardly, as if he might trip 	his own feet. Ch'Targh sidesteps languidly, like a 	cat, easily blocks the blow, and slams an elbow into 	Alexander's face that sends him reeling.	Infuriated, Alexander recovers and attempts to rush the 	bigger man. Ch'Targh again avoids the thrust, delivers 	a nasty but superficial cut to Alexander's cheek and 	dumps the boy unceremoniously to the floor.					CH'TARGH				(to the others)			He fights like a Ferengi.	Ch'Targh pauses to enjoy the ensuing laugh as Alexander 	regains his feet. Ch'Targh's overconfidence provides 	an opening through which Alexander's dagger connects, 	nicking his upper arm before the veteran can pivot 	aside.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Sons and...
