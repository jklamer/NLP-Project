SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing the station.  The only ship in port is the 	PROMETHEUS, a Federation science vessel, not in any way 	noteworthy or obtrusive.					SISKO (V.O.)			Personal Log, Stardate 47329.4.  I 			finally realize why I've had trouble 			sleeping the last few nights.  			Yesterday was the fourth anniversary 			of the massacre at Wolf three five 			nine... the fourth anniversary of 			Jennifer's death.1A   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS	Light are low.  SISKO is sitting on the couch.  There's a 	chess problem laid out on the three-dimensional chess board 	that sits, forgotten, in front of him.					SISKO (V.O.)				(continuing)			I'm not sure what bothers me more.  			The date itself... or the fact that 			it almost passed unnoticed.1B   NEW ANGLE	As a pajama-clad JAKE steps out of his bedroom.					JAKE			Dad... what are you doing up?					SISKO			I was about to ask you the same thing.					JAKE				(no big deal)			I had a weird dream.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - TEASER           1A.1B   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Why don't you get a hot chocolate 			and tell me about it?					JAKE			Nah, it's nothing.	But he sits down next to his father and we see that he needs 	some comfort.  Sisko throws a comforting arm around his son's 	shoulder.					SISKO			So tell me about this "weird" dream.					JAKE			it's stupid.					SISKO			Maybe so, but the thing about dreams 			is, if you talk about them, they 			kind of go away faster.					JAKE			Okay, but don't laugh.					SISKO			I promise.	A beat.  Jake has to reassemble the path of the dream.					JAKE			I don't know... I was... on the 			station somewhere, but I'm not sure 			where... and I kept trying to get 			back here... but I couldn't find my 			way.  Every time I thought I saw a 			familiar corridor, it kind of twisted 			off in some other direction...				(trails off)			See? I told you it was stupid.					SISKO			You got me interested.					JAKE			Well... then...				(embarrassed)			I guess I got a little scared and 			started looking for you... but I 			couldn't find you... Somehow I ended 			up in Ops... but you weren't in your 			office.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - TEASER           1B.1B   CONTINUED:	(2)					JAKE (Cont'd)			And then it was like... the floor 			started sloping down... and I couldn't 			keep my balance... and all I wanted 			to do was find you...	Sisko gives him a friendly hug.					SISKO			And here I am.	A long beat.  Jake is glad to have his father there.					JAKE			Dad...				(almost apologetic)			I love you.					SISKO				(smiles)			I love you too.	Sisko kisses his son on the forehead.					JAKE			I have a calculus test in the morning.					SISKO			Then you better get some sleep.	Jake gets up and heads for his room, but stops by the door.					JAKE			Dad... I miss her.					SISKO			Me too.	Jake nods and EXITS.1C   CLOSE ON SISKO	Glad that he could help his son, but still feeling the weight 	of his own melancholy.  He picks up a chess piece... then 	puts it back down.  He's lost interest.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - TEASER           1C.2    INT. PROMENADE - AFTER HOURS	The Promenade is dark and relatively quiet.  There's just 	enough activity being played out in the shadows to make an 	observer wonder what unfolds while the station sleeps.3    INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL	Sisko walks along the upper level. He stops at a viewport 	and stares into the depths of space.4    CLOSE ON SISKO	Watching the stars burn in the endless darkness.					FENNA (O.S.)			Beautiful, aren't they?	Startled, Sisko turns around and sees...           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - TEASER            2.5    NEW ANGLE	An unconventionally attractive alien woman, FENNA, standing 	behind him.  Off Sisko's questioning look, she looks out the 	viewport with wide-eyed amazement.					FENNA			I don't think I've ever seen the 			stars shine so brightly.	Sisko reacts.  He really wanted to be alone, but there's 	something about Fenna that intrigues him.					SISKO				(re: the stars)			The Bajorans call that constellation 			the Runners.				(a beat)			I can never figure out if they're 			running toward something or away 			from something.					FENNA				(studying the stars)			Does it really matter?  Sometimes it 			just feels good to run.					SISKO			I never thought of it that way.	Sisko turns back toward Fenna.  He studies her for a second, 	then...					SISKO			My names Benjamin Sisko.  I'm the 			Commander of this station.					FENNA			I'm...				(there's the slightest 				pause before she 				says her name)			Fenna.				(smiles)			I'm sorry.  You must be very busy.  			I didn't mean to bother you.					SISKO			You're not bothering me at all.					FENNA			Good.  I'm glad.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - TEASER            3.6    NEW ANGLE	They begin walking along the upper level of the Promenade.					FENNA				(continuing)			Commander of the station... that 			must be very exciting.  All those 			ships coming and going... Every day 			must bring something new.					SISKO				(agreeing)			It has its moments.				(a beat)			In some ways, though, I prefer times 			like this the best... when everything 			is quiet... And...	Sisko can't quite put his feelings into words.					FENNA				(finishing this thought)			And you can feel a kind of 			anticipation in the air... like 			something wonderful's going to 			happen... but you don't know what it 			is...	Fenna catches herself, and smiles at her own enthusiasm.					FENNA				(continuing)			I guess that sounds pretty silly, 			doesn't it?					SISKO			Not at all.  That's one of the great 			things about this station.  You never 			know what's going to happen next...	They reach a crossover bridge near one of the spiral 	staircases.					SISKO				(continuing, smiles)			Or who you're going to meet.	Fenna returns the smile.  There's something curious about 	this woman.  Sisko wants to learn more about her.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - TEASER            4.6    CONTINUED:					FENNA			I like it here.  I wish I could stay 			longer.					SISKO			Where are you going?					FENNA				(thinks for a beat, 				then)			I'm not really sure.  So I guess 			I'll just keep going...				(glances at the stars)			Like the Runners.7    CLOSE ON SISKO	who glances over the railing down at the Promenade, where 	Morn is shuffling off to bed.					SISKO			I'll tell you what, before you run 			any farther, why don't I show you 			around the station... If you have 			the time?	There's no answer from Fenna.  Sisko turns back toward her...8    NEW ANGLE	And Fenna is gone.					SISKO			Fenna?	Sisko looks around.  The upper level of the Promenade is now 	completely deserted.  Puzzled, Sisko moves to the top of the 	spiral staircase and looks down.  He's too late... there's 	no one there.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - TEASER            5.9    CLOSE ON SISKO	As he thinks about going to look for her, then decides against 	it.  Hold on Sisko for a beat as he surveys the empty 	Promenade with a mixture of curiosity and surprise, then...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT ONE         6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)10   INT. OPS	KIRA at the Ops Table, O'BRIEN at work in the pit, various 	N.D. Supernumeraries at the other stations.11   NEW ANGLE	As Sisko ENTERS from the Turbolift, looking chipper.  He 	spots O'Brien in the pit.					SISKO			Good morning, Chief.	O'Brien doesn't look up from the endless maze of circuitry 	he's working on.					O'BRIEN				(mind on his work)			Morning, Commander.					SISKO				(nodding at the 				circuitry)			Is this maintenance or repair?	O'Brien actually has to stop and think about that one.					O'BRIEN			Right now it's maintenance, but five 			will get you ten it'll end up being 			repair before I'm through.	O'Brien was only half-joking, but Sisko smiles.					SISKO			Admit it, Chief... If you were on a 			station where everything worked, 			you'd be miserable.	O'Brien continues probing the circuitry.					O'BRIEN			You may be right, sir.	The electronics give off a bright spark.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - ACT ONE           7.11   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(almost to himself)			But I'd be willing to give it a try.	Sisko smiles and shakes his head, leaving O'Brien to his 	endless "maintenance."12   FOLLOW SISKO	As he goes to the replicator, passing Kira at the Ops Table.					SISKO			Good morning, Major.				(to the replicator)			Chiraltan Tea, with a double twist 			of lemon.13   ANGLE ON KIRA	Looking curiously at Sisko as he removes his tea from the 	replicator.  He sips it, finds it to his liking, and joins 	her at the operations table.14   ON SISKO	as he sits down, he notices Kira's questioning gaze.					SISKO			Something wrong?					KIRA				(covers her curiosity)			No, nothing.					SISKO			Major, if something's bothering you... 			I want to hear it.					KIRA			It's just... every morning for the 			last year, I've seen you walk in 			here and start your day with a 			raktajino.					SISKO			I like raktajino.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - ACT ONE           8.14   CONTINUED:					KIRA				(that's no surprise)			I know.  You never even talk to anyone 			until you've had your first cup.					SISKO				(acknowledging)			I'm not awake until I've had my first 			cup.					KIRA				(re: cup)			Then how come you're drinking 			Chiraltan Tea?	Sisko looks at the cup, thinks about it.					SISKO			I guess I felt like having something 			different.				(kidding her)			That is all right with you, isn't it?					KIRA			Of course.  You can drink whatever 			you want.					SISKO				(amused)			Thank you, Major.  Your support is 			appreciated.					DAX'S COM VOICE			Dax to Sisko.					SISKO				(taps his combadge)			Go ahead, Lieutenant.					DAX'S COM VOICE			Professor Seyetik and I are in the 			science lab, if you'd like to meet 			him.	Sisko's been looking forward to this.					SISKO			On my way.	Sisko EXITS.       DEEP SPACE:  "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - ACT ONE     xx9        15   ANGLE ON KIRA	O'Brien joins her at the Ops Table.					O'BRIEN			The commander seems to be in an 			especially good mood this morning.					KIRA				(distracted)			He is... isn't he?					O'BRIEN			Something on your mind, Major?					KIRA			No... it's just...				(a beat)			You work with someone for a year or 			so... You think you finally have 			them figured out... and then...				(mystified)			They go and order Chiraltan Tea.	Hold on O'Brien, waiting for the punchline.16   INT. SCIENCE LAB	Sisko ENTERS and is met by DAX.					SISKO			Lieutenant...				(looks around)			Where's our guest?					DAX				(matter-of-fact)			Inside the flux generator.					SISKO				(surprised)			What?17   NEW ANGLE	Sisko looks over at a door with a small window at eye level.  	The door provides access to a glowing chamber that throbs 	with energy.  It's obviously not a good place to walk into.					SISKO			What's he doing in there?  He could 			be killed.        DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT ONE        10.17   CONTINUED:					DAX				(nonchalant)			That's what I tried to tell him.					SISKO			And he went in anyway?					DAX			Have you ever met a terraformer?					SISKO			No.  What's that got to do with it?					DAX			You can't tell a terraformer anything.  			It's an amazing talent... bringing 			dead worlds to life.  But humility 			and common sense aren't exactly part 			of the job description.18   ANGLE ON THE GENERATOR (OPTICAL)	Just then, the door opens and a large figure emerges, haloed 	by the flashing glow of the generator.  The figure, dressed 	in some sort of futuristic protective gear, passes through a 	forcefield, steps into the lab and the door closes behind 	him.19   NEW ANGLE	GIDEON SEYETIK removes his protective headgear.  He's a huge, 	grizzled lion of a man.					SEYETIK			There you go, Lieutenant.  That should 			increase your generator output by at 			least five percent.	Seyetik notices Sisko, and steps forward with delight in his 	eyes.					SEYETIK				(continuing, with 				gusto)			You must be Commander Sisko.  Gideon 			Seyetik... It's a pleasure to meet 			you.	Seyetik shakes Sisko's hand aggressively.  His voice and 	smile fill the lab.        DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - REV. 10/07/93 - ACT ONE        11.19   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Professor... I'm a great admirer of 			your work.					SEYETIK			Excellent.  A man of intelligence 			and taste.  I can tell we're going 			to get along famously.	Sisko can't help but smile.  Seyetik is a piece of work 	all right.					SISKO			My son and I visited Blue Horizon on 			our way to Deep Space Nine.  I was 			impressed.					SEYETIK				(used to compliments)			Of course you were.  I created the 			place and even I'm impressed.				(a beat)			How'd you like Da Vinci Falls?					SISKO			I'm afraid we didn't get to see them.  			We were only on the surface for a 			few hours.	Seyetik shakes his head sympathetically.					SEYETIK			Then you missed Blue Horizon's 			crowning glory.				(passionate)			Imagine... Water cascading off cliffs 			the height of Mount Everest and 			thundering through continuous 			rainbows, straight into an ocean the 			color of Sapphire Wine.  I'll have 			to take you there one day...				(a half smile)			By God, I wouldn't mind seeing it 			again myself.					SISKO				(amused)			I may take you up on that.        DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - REV. 10/07/93 - ACT ONE        12.19   CONTINUED:	(2)					SEYETIK			But first... Epsilon One-Nineteen.					SISKO			I understand the initial surveys 			look promising.					SEYETIK			Promising... They look magnificent... 			Think of if... Reigniting a dead 			sun.  Bringing new life to an entire 			solar system.  Next to that, 			terraforming planets will look like 			child's play.					DAX			Let's hope it works.  Right now, 			it's only a promising theory.					SEYETIK			Of course it'll work.  I never fail...				(confidentially)			Well, I did once, but I found it 			didn't agree with me, so I swore not 			to do it again... and I never break 			my word.				(a beat)			You should be glad you're coming 			with me, Lieutenant.  This will be 			my crowning achievement.				(savoring the thought)			Giving birth to a star.  Even I'll 			have a hard time topping this one.					SISKO				(amused)			Maybe we should go over your proto-			matter containment procedures.           DEEP SPACE: "Second Sight" - 09/28/93 - ACT ONE          13.19   CONTINUED:	(3)					SEYETIK			A splendid idea.  I think you'll 			find it fascinating.				(a beat)			After all, I designed the containment 			capsule myself.	Sisko grins.  Dax rolls her eyes.20   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Re-establishing the station and the Prometheus.21   INT. PROMENADE - SECOND LEVEL - QUARK'S	Sisko and Dax are at one of the tables outside of Quark's.  	Sisko's finished eating and is watching the passing traffic 	on the second level of the Promenade.
