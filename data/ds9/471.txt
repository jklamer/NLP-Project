I have to show the 			admissions committee how determined 			I am to become a cadet.	Jake sees the determination in his friend's face.					JAKE			Don't worry so much, Nog... you're 			going to be a great cadet.	Suddenly Quark's voice thunders from offscreen.					QUARK (O.S.)			But in the meantime, you make a lousy 			stockboy...9    NEW ANGLE	Revealing QUARK, shaking his head with dismay.  He moves 	toward Nog, pleads with him.					QUARK				(re: Jake)			Why can't you take after your friend 			here?  He knows enough to stay out 			of Starfleet.  Even a human can see 			that there are a lot more profitable 			opportunities out there for a young 			man with ambition.					NOG			Uncle, he wants to be a writer.  			There's no profit in that.					QUARK			On the contrary.  Writing holosuite 			programs...				(a wink and a nudge 				to Jake)			-- especially the more... intimate 			variety -- is very profitable...					JAKE				(wan)			I'll bet...              DEEP SPACE: "Facets" - 03/30/95 - TEASER               5.9    CONTINUED:					QUARK			Tell you what.				(genuinely excited)			The two of you come up with a 			proposal, and I'll put up the latinum 			for your first program.	Jake and Nog exchange a look...					NOG			I don't think so, Uncle...	Quark has had enough... there's only so much he can do for 	his nephew.					QUARK			Fine.  Join Starfleet.  I don't know 			why I bother trying to help you, 			anyway.  Go down to the storeroom 			and get your father, tell him to get 			behind the bar.				(straightening his 				clothes)			Lieutenant Dax has asked me to join 			the senior staff for a very important 			meeting in the wardroom.	And with that, Quark turns and EXITS, swaggering a bit at 	his own importance... Jake and Nog exchange puzzled looks as 	they watch him leave...10   INT.

WARDROOM	as Odo and Bashir ENTER.  KIRA, QUARK, O'BRIEN, and LEETA 	are already seated at the table.  SISKO and DAX are off to 	the side discussing something privately.  "Hello's" are 	exchanged as the two newcomers take their seats, Bashir moving 	to sit next to Leeta.  She's dressed in civilian clothes, 	and since she's not at work, she's not pouring on the sex 	appeal.  We can see that she and Bashir are close and easy 	with each other.	After a beat, Sisko and Dax wrap it up and he takes his seat.  	When everyone's taken their place, Dax addresses the group...					DAX			Thank you all for coming... I'll get 			right to the point... you're the 			seven people on this station I feel 			closest to... and I want you all to 			be a part of my zhian'tara...					QUARK			Zhian'tara... what's that?	Leeta alone seems to know... she turns excitedly to Bashir 	and whispers...            DEEP SPACE: "Facets" - REV. 04/03/95 - TEASER            7.11   CONTINUED:					LEETA				(sotto)			It's the Trill Rite of Closure... 			I've read about it...	Dax continues, not having heard her.					DAX			The zhian'tara is a ritual where 			joined Trills get the chance to 			actually meet their previous hosts...	A few baffled looks between our people, then...					KIRA			Meet them?  How?	Dax understands full well how strange this is going to sound.					DAX				(to the group)			That's where you come in...

"borrow" our 			bodies?	Dax tries to explain this admittedly odd-sounding request...					DAX			If you agree to participate, the 			memories of one of my previous hosts 			will be temporarily removed from the 			symbiont and imprinted onto you... 			you'll essentially become one of my 			hosts for the duration of the ritual.	Quark's face goes pale at the sound of this.  Bashir, on the 	other hand, is fascinated...					BASHIR			How is this accomplished?					DAX			The memories are transferred 			telepathically by a Guardian.					ODO			A Guardian... ?					LEETA			They take care of the symbionts... 			usually they're unjoined Trills.	Everyone turns to look at Leeta, surprised that she knows so 	much about this.  Bashir can't help but smile proudly...					BASHIR			Leeta is sort of an amateur 			sociologist.					LEETA			It comes in handy in my line of 			work... You never know who you'll 			meet at the dabo table...           DEEP SPACE: "Facets" - REV. 04/03/95 - ACT ONE            9.12   CONTINUED:	She glances at Quark with a wry look, but his mind is 	elsewhere... he's not sure he wants anything to do with this 	zhian'tara.					QUARK			You're asking me to hand my body 			over to some... dead person?	Dax suppresses a smile...					DAX			Just for a few hours...					QUARK			What happens to "me" in the meantime?					DAX			You'll remain conscious of what's 			going on around you... you can 			reassert yourself and regain 			control of your body at any time.					SISKO			But it's best if you relax and let 			the host's memories emerge... the 			point is to give Jadzia the chance 			to interact with her previous hosts.				(to Dax)			Curzon spoke very fondly of his 			zhian'tara... he said it was one of 			the most powerful experiences of his 			life...	Bashir has one concern...					BASHIR			I do have one question... what about 			Joran?					QUARK			Joran... ?  Was he that...				(twirling a finger 				near his temple in 				the universal sign 				for crazy)			-- crazy host of yours?

I'm in.					LEETA			Me, too.	Dax smiles, pleased.  Kira, O'Brien and Odo each nod in 	succession to indicate their willingness to participate.  	All eyes settle on Quark, who's been trying to keep perfectly 	still, hoping no one would notice him... After a moment...					QUARK			Why's everyone looking at me... ?					ODO			Because you're the only one who hasn't 			agreed to participate.					QUARK			I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

A triangular 	ALTAR occupies the center of the room, and a bench is near 	the window.  In a few small areas the altar has a reflective 	surface, almost mirror-like.  In its center, a small cauldron 	of whitish liquid bubbles over a flame.	The Guardian is standing behind Dax and Kira... their eyes 	are shut, their features meditative...
