QUARK'S	WORF sits alone at a table. He looks back and forth 	between the PADD in his hand, and a SHADY ALIEN at the 	end of the bar.2    ON THE PADD	A grim mugshot which might be the Alien on a really bad 	day.3    AT THE TABLE	Worf examines the picture again, almost certain it's a 	match.	QUARK comes up behind him, about to deliver Worf's 	drink. He pauses to peek over Worf's shoulder at the 	PADD. Quark also begins looking back and forth, 	comparing.					QUARK 			That is the worst mugshot I've 			ever seen.	Worf reacts, surprised and repelled to find Quark so 	close. He puts the PADD face down on the table, hiding 	it from Quark's view.					QUARK 			I've never understood why law 			enforcement agencies don't keep 			better visual records. You'd 			think they'd be concerned about 			little things like making an 			accurate identification.					WORF			This picture is accurate enough to 			establish that your... customer is 			Regana Tosh, who is known to be 			associated with a Markalian 			smuggling operation.	Worf gives him a pointed look, implying that Quark 	should care about this fact. But Quark just shrugs it 	off.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - TEASER     2.3    CONTINUED:					QUARK 			Really? Well, everyone's welcome 			at Quark's. I don't discriminate.				(as if realizing) 			Just like Starfleet. They have a 			non-discrimination policy too, 			don't they, commander?	Quark sets Worf's drink on the table and gives him a smile.					QUARK  			I guess we have something in  			common.	Worf bristles. KIRA approaches the table.					KIRA				(to Quark)  			You have more in common with  			Rakonian swamp rats, Quark.					QUARK  			Major. Always a delight to see  			you here. What can I get for you?					KIRA  			Tarkalean tea, not too sweet this			time.	Quark heads off to the bar. Kira sits opposite Worf, 	who picks up the PADD and studies it for a moment.					KIRA				(re: PADD)   			Catching up on some work?					WORF			Not exactly.	He shows her the PADD, with the Alien's file.					WORF   			This man arrived on the station   			this afternoon and came directly   			here. I believe the Ferengi   			bartender is plotting something   			with him.					KIRA			I wouldn't be surprised. Quark's   			always up to something.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - TEASER     3.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					WORF 			If he's a known criminal, why 			doesn't your security chief do 			something about him?					KIRA			Odo keeps him in check.	Worf looks back at Quark.4    AT THE BAR	Quark is talking intently with the Shady Alien.					WORF 			But not in prison.5    EXT.

RUNABOUT	BASHIR is getting a cup of tea out of the replicator. 	He crosses back to the cockpit area and we see O'BRIEN 	sitting in the pilot seat. Mid-conversation.					BASHIR (V.O.) 				(continuing)   			We are on course back to the   			wormhole and should arrive at the   			station two days ahead of   			schedule.					O'BRIEN   			Keiko's only on the station a few   			days at a time. I'm the one   			living in those quarters, and if    			I want to set up a little workshop    			in the bedroom...					BASHIR			You set up a workshop in the    			bedroom?					O'BRIEN			I don't use it when she's    			visiting.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - TEASER     4.6    CONTINUED:					BASHIR 			Of course not.					O'BRIEN			She says that I'm trying to "live 			like a bachelor again," that I'm 			expressing a "subconscious desire" 			to push her out of our quarters.					BASHIR 			That's ridiculous.					O'BRIEN			That's what I said.					BASHIR 			If anything, I'd say that choosing 			to spend your free time in the 			bedroom -- a place you intimately 			associate with Keiko -- you're 			actually expressing a desire to be 			closer to her during her absence. 			It's quite touching, really.	O'Brien hadn't looked at it quite that way before, but 	he jumps on this rationale immediately.					O'BRIEN  			Exactly, exactly. See, you  			understand. Now, why can't she  			see that? Why can't she be more  			like...	He stops himself just before he utters the words, "more 	like you." Bashir smiles, enjoying the opportunity to 	rib him.					BASHIR  			More like... ?					O'BRIEN				(awkward)  			A... man. More like a man.					BASHIR  			So you wish Keiko was a man?					O'BRIEN  			I wish... I was on this trip with  			someone else.	Bashir smiles, having scored a small victory in their 	never-ending game. Suddenly, there's a BEEP from the 	console.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - 07/28/95 - TEASER       5.6    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN				(off console)   			We're picking up a subspace   			magneton pulse... bearing zero-  			nine-zero, mark one-one-five.				(works)   			The Bopak system.					BASHIR  			What's a magneton pulse?					O'BRIEN   			It's a burst of polarized magnetic   			energy... it's usually produced by   			a damaged warp core.					BASHIR   			So there could be a ship in   			trouble?					O'BRIEN   			Possibly.				(beat)   			Let's have a look.									CUT TO:7    EXT.

RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)	O'Brien and Bashir studying the readings on the 	console.					O'BRIEN    			I'm having trouble pinpointing    			the source of the magneton    			pulse... too much EM interference    			in the atmosphere. But it's    			definitely down there somewhere.					BASHIR				(off monitor)    			According to our records, Bopak    			Three is uninhabited... the    			nearest Dominion outpost is six    			weeks away... and this system is    			well off the established trade    			routes in the Gamma Quadrant.	O'Brien frowns at the monitor for a moment.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 08/01/95 - TEASER     6.8    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN     			A strange place for a ship to set     			down, even if it was having engine     			trouble. I suppose it could just     			be an anomalous reading ... but I'd     			feel a lot better if we ...				(sees something on monitor)     			Hold on. There's some kind of     			energy surge on--	Suddenly the ship is ROCKED and a SPIDER WEB of SPIKY 	BLUE ENERGY spreads across the front window like a net. 	The lights and power in the runabout FLUCTUATE and the 	ship goes to RED ALERT.					BASHIR      			What the hell... ?					O'BRIEN      			We've been hit by a plasma field.      			We're losing main power.      			Switching to auxiliary units.	O'Brien works, but the ROCKING continues and the 	systems in the ship continue to go OFF.					O'BRIEN      			The field's draining our power...      			I can't break free...					BASHIR      			We're losing altitude.					O'BRIEN      			Send out a distress call. I'll      			try to get us down in one piece.	They both go to work as the runabout enters the 	atmosphere and begins jumping and jerking in the 	turbulent air. The noise level in the runabout RISES 	with the rush of wind.					BASHIR				(a shout, working)       			Our com system's jammed.					O'BRIEN				(yells)       			I'm reading a clearing up ahead...       			I think we can make it.				(beat)       			Hang on.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - TEASER     7.9    NEW ANGLE	Including the front windows. Smoke, clouds and 	wind rush by the windows ...9A   EXT. PLANET ATMOSPHERE - NIGHT (OPTICAL)	The Runabout begins plunging into the dense jungle 	foliage.9B   INT. RUNABOUT 	As before. The ship bucks and jumps as it hits the 	ground. Branches and leaves slam onto the window as 	the ship slides to a surprisingly gentle halt. There's 	a silent moment as they both realize they made it and 	that the ship is still intact. They look at each other 	and then break into smiles of relief.10   EXT. JUNGLE - RUNABOUT - NIGHT (OPTICAL)	The Runabout sits in a relatively clear patch, 	surrounded by dark, green jungle foliage. The ship 	looks a bit scorched, but structurally whole.	The door slides open. O'Brien emerges first, 	cautiously, holding a phaser. Bashir is right behind 	him, also armed and ready. All they see is jungle.					BASHIR 				(dry)       			Lovely place. 				(sniffs)      			Smells like a garbage dump.					O'BRIEN			I'm sorry I didn't find a nicer       			place to crash-land. Should we       			try again?	Bashir is about to make a tart reply when SIX JEM'HADAR 	SOLDIERS SHIMMER into view, all heavily armed. Their 	leader - GORAN'AGAR - steps forward.					GORAN'AGAR 			Do not move. You are prisoners of 			the Jem'Hadar.	Off Bashir and O'Brien, realizing just how much trouble 	they're in...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic oath"-REV. 07/31/95 - ACT ONE     8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)11   EXT. JUNGLE - RUNABOUT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)	Jem'Hadar Soldiers #1 (TEMO'ZUMA), #2 (MESO'CLAN), and 	#3 flank Bashir and O'Brien, swiftly taking away their 	phasers and combadges. Jem'Hadar #4 and #5 	(ARAK'TARAL) give the Runabout a quick appraisal, 	then go inside.	The Jem'Hadar move with the smooth confidence of highly 	trained, elite combat troops. They're the best in the 	galaxy and they know it. Goran'Agar keeps his weapon 	at his side, but has an intelligent, calculating 	presence which makes him seem even more dangerous than 	the others. There is no neck tube in his uniform, 	although this isn't immediately noticeable.					GORAN'AGAR 			Are there other Starfleet ships 			with you?	O'Brien doesn't want to answer. Goran'Agar pulls out 	his weapon in a smooth, practiced motion and puts it to 	O'Brien's forehead. He never raises his voice.					GORAN'AGAR 			Tell me.					BASHIR				(quickly) 			There are no other ships with us. 			But if we don't return, Starfleet 			will begin looking for us.					GORAN'AGAR 			When?					BASHIR 			Soon.	Goran'Agar considers him for a brief moment.					GORAN'AGAR 			You're lying.	The Jem'Hadar in the Runabout, Arak'Taral, emerges, and 	reports to Goran'Agar.					ARAK'TARAL 			No other crew. It's a standard 			Danube-class runabout. Some 			modifications have been made to 			the phaser array and shield 			generators.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - ACT ONE    9.11   CONTINUED:	Goran'Agar turns his gaze back to O'Brien and Bashir. He 	might as well be looking at two plants for all the 	warmth and interest in his look.					GORAN'AGAR  			Why were you in this star system?	O'Brien again says nothing -- he knows they're dead 	anyway, so he's not going to talk. Bashir, on the 	other hand is still hoping that there might be a way to 	reason with them.					BASHIR  			We picked up a magneton pulse...  			we thought there might be a ship  			in trouble, so we altered our  			course to--	That's all the information Goran'Agar needs.					GORAN'AGAR				(to Temo'Zuma)  			Return to the ship. Put a damping  			field around our warp engine.	Temo'Zuma gives a curt nod and heads off into the 	jungle. Goran'Agar turns back to his prisoners.  He 	studies O'Brien for a moment.					GORAN'AGAR  			Human. Gold uniform indicates  			specialty in Security or  			Engineering. Rank: chief petty  			officer.				(to O'Brien)  			You are what Starfleet refers to  			as a "noncom."					O'BRIEN  			That's right.					GORAN'AGAR  			You must have a great deal of  			experience.					O'BRIEN				(cautious) 			I've been around...					GORAN'AGAR  			That makes you a priority target.  			We will kill you first.	Two of the other Jem'Hadar grab O'Brien by the arms and 	wait for Goran'Agar's order.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - ACT ONE   9A.11   CONTINUED:	(2)	Goran'Agar turns to Bashir and peers at him a moment.					GORAN'AGAR   			Human. Rank of lieutenant with a   			specialty in the sciences.					BASHIR   			Doctor actually.	This information seems to take Goran'Agar by surprise. 	He stares at Bashir for a moment, then turns away lost 	in thought. Arak'Taral steps forward and grabs Bashir 	by the arm.					ARAK'TARAL    			Science and medical officers are    			low priority targets. I submit we    			execute this one and use the other    			in a tactical exercise.	Goran'Agar turns back with a thoughtful look.					GORAN'AGAR     			No. Bring them both back to camp.	With that, Goran'Agar heads off into the jungle, deep 	in thought. Arak'Taral hesitates for a moment, 	surprised by this decision, then pushes Bashir forward.					ARAK'TARAL      			Move.	As they all head off into the jungle...    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - ACT ONE   10.12   INT.

CAVES - DAY (OPTICAL)	Bashir and O'Brien sit on the floor in the middle of a	cylindrical forcefield functioning as a holding cell	(as seen in "The Jem'Hadar").

Someone here 			is hurt, or sick.					O'BRIEN 			If that's true, don't help them, 			Julian. Anything that weakens 			them increases our chances of 			getting out of here.	Before Bashir can reply, Goran'Agar ENTERS the cave. 	He uses a device on his arm to turn off the forcefield. 	He gestures at Bashir, but doesn't feel the need to 	draw his gun.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - 07/28/95 - ACT ONE      13.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					GORAN'AGAR  			Come with me.				(indicating O'Brien) 			He stays.	Bashir steps out of the circle, and the forcefield 	FRITZES on behind him.

Even Arak'Taral is having a hard  	time maintaining his composure. They try to stand at  	attention as Goran'Agar walks slowly along the rank,  	eyeing each of his men. Bashir takes note of  	everything, but keeps a discreet distance away.  	Goran'Agar pauses in front of Temo'Zuma... then gently  	pushes him in the chest. Temo'Zuma almost collapses to  	the ground. Arak'Taral looks away in shame.  	Goran'Agar gives Bashir a meaningful look before  	turning back to Temo'Zuma.					GORAN'AGAR 			You didn't fall.

After a beat, the drug can be seen flowing  	through the tubes again. As the drug re-enters their  	bodies, we can see visible relief sweep across the  	Jem'Hadar. The following dialogue takes place over the  	above action.					GORAN'AGAR				(to Bashir, sotto) 			I've told them we have enough 			White to last twenty-seven days. 			But that's a lie.

A collection of plants and rocks has been 	scattered across the floor and Bashir is patiently 	taking physical samples from the collection and placing 	them in Jem'Hadar containers he's using as Petri 	dishes.	O'Brien is disassembling a tricorder at a table, 	running optical cabling over to a small DEVICE cobbled 	together from various parts. Components and tools are 	scattered on the floor around him. Meso'Clan is 	standing guard and watches the proceedings from the 	door.

I shouldn't have 			doubted you.	He leans in close, examining the prisoners.					ARAK'TARAL 			Should we kill them ourselves, or 			let the others?					GORAN'AGAR 			I will do the killing.	He SHOOTS Arak'Taral, but it gives Goran'Agar no 	pleasure as the other Jem'Hadar falls dead.					GORAN'AGAR				(quiet, to Bashir) 			Take your ship, and go.					BASHIR 			Goran'Agar... if you stay here, 			they'll kill you.					GORAN'AGAR 			Unless I kill them first. It 			would be better for them to die 			quickly in battle, than slowly... 			as the drug runs out.   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - ACT FIVE   48.50   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR				(frustrated)			You don't have to do this.. 			Even if we can't save the others, you 			don't need to sacrifice yourself.	Goran'Agar turns to O'Brien.					GORAN'AGAR 			You're a soldier?					O'BRIEN			I have been.					GORAN'AGAR 			Then you explain.	O'Brien nods after a beat. Goran'Agar turns and 	SHIMMERS AWAY. Bashir looks at O'Brien.					O'BRIEN			He was their commander. They 			trusted him. He can't leave them.	There's a quiet beat... and then O'Brien heads for the 	runabout. Bashir stands there a moment longer, looks 	out at the jungle, having a hard time with this.						O'BRIEN				(gently)			Julian...	Bashir finally goes inside the runabout.51   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE 	Sisko sits at his desk, doing his least favorite chore -- 	paperwork. He takes a PADD from a large stack of them, 	and begins reading it.	There's a CHIME at the door. Sisko puts down the PADD, 	relieved at the interruption.					SISKO 			Come in.	Worf ENTERS, not happy.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - 07/28/95 - ACT FIVE    48A.51   CONTINUED:					WORF 			Captain, I have information I 			would like to add to Security 			Chief Odo's last report. He 			didn't feel it was necessary to 			include the details of my 			involvement, but I think you 			should know that I hindered his 			investigation.   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - ACT FIVE   49.51   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 			Yes, I heard about what happened.	Worf looks at him, surprised.					SISKO 			Word gets around in a place like 			this. It's one of the things 			you'll have to get used to.					WORF			One of many things, it seems.					SISKO			Starfleet officers often have 			trouble learning the unofficial 			rules of the station. There's no 			manual to study. You have to 			figure things out as you go. 				(beat, smiles) 			A little different than life on a 			starship.					WORF			When I served on the Enterprise, 			I always knew who were my 			allies... and who were my 			enemies.					SISKO			Let's just say DS-Nine has more... 			shades of gray. 				(smiles) 			And Quark is definitely a shade of 			gray. But he has his own set of 			rules, and he follows them 			diligently. Once you understand 			what they are, you'll understand 			Quark. I'd say that's true for 			everyone here.				(beat) 			You'll fit in, Commander. Give it 			time.	Off Worf, feeling somewhat encouraged, but still 	wondering if he'll ever figure this place out...									CUT TO:   DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - REV. 07/31/95 - ACT FIVE   50.52   EXT. SPACE - THE WORMHOLE (OPTICAL)	As it OPENS and the Runabout EMERGES into the Alpha 	Quadrant.53   INT. RUNABOUT	O'Brien and Bashir pilot the runabout, approaching the 	station.					KIRA'S COM VOICE 			Kira to Rubicon. Docking Platform 			Two is open. Welcome back, 			gentlemen.					O'BRIEN			Thanks, Major.	They go about the landing procedure quietly. The 	silence between the two men is unusual... neither of them 	likes it, but neither is quite sure what to say. 	O'Brien finally breaks the silence.					O'BRIEN			You can bring me up on charges, 			you know.					BASHIR 			That's not really my style.	O'Brien nods.					O'BRIEN			I... wish things could've been 			different, Julian.					BASHIR 			So do I.					O'BRIEN			And I'm sorry I had to destroy 			your work.					BASHIR 				(quiet) 			You didn't have to, Chief. You 			had a choice. And you chose to 			disobey orders, override my 			judgment, and condemn those men 			to death.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Hippocratic Oath" - 07/28/95 - ACT FIVE     51.53   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			Yes, I did. 				(beat) 			Because I thought it was the only 			way to save your life. Whatever 			else you make think of me and what 			I did -- at least understand why 			I did it.	Bashir looks at O'Brien, and they hold each other's 	gaze for a long moment. Finally Bashir nods in 	acceptance of O'Brien's motives, if not his actions. 	O'Brien is satisfied with that, and goes back to work 	for a moment.					BASHIR 			Tonight's supposed to be our 			weekly dart game...					O'BRIEN 			Don't worry. I don't feel like 			playing either.					BASHIR 			Maybe in a few days.	They look at each other... and they both know that 	although there's a rift between them now, it won't be 	forever. That knowledge gives them at least a small 	measure of comfort, and they manage faint smiles at 	each other as they go back to piloting the runabout...54   EXT.
