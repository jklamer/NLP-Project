QUARK'S	BASHIR and QUARK are closely watching DAX at the bar. 	She is in the middle of performing a magic trick for 	them. As they watch, she shows them there's nothing in 	her hands... nothing up her sleeves... then her 	expression changes to one of puzzlement... she seems 	to have something caught in her throat... she frowns 	and struggles for a moment... then produces an EGG from 	her mouth. She smiles in triumph.					QUARK			It's a trick.					BASHIR 			Of course it's a trick. But do 			you know how she did it?					QUARK 			She probably had the egg beamed 			directly into her mouth from one 			of the transporters.					DAX			Actually, one of my previous hosts 			used to dabble in sleight of hand.					BASHIR 			Tobin, by any chance?					DAX			That's right.					BASHIR 			He sounds like the type. 			Painfully shy, introverted, a 			certain lack of confidence... just 			the kind of person who would begin 			looking for ways to dazzle people 			with his "magical" abilities.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/30/95 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED:					QUARK				(still thinking about 				the trick) 			She swallowed the egg before she 			came into the bar. Then she 			regurgitated it on cue. Quite 			disgusting, actually.					DAX 			Wrong again.					SISKO'S COM VOICE 			Sisko to Dax. I'd like to see you 			in my office, commander.					DAX				(to com) 			On my way, Benjamin.				(to Quark) 			Don't worry, Quark. I'm sure 			you'll figure it out eventually.	Dax peers closely at Quark's ear... frowns at something 	she sees.					DAX				(continuing) 			Hmm... no wonder you can't figure 			it out.					QUARK				(worried) 			What?	Dax reaches out and pulls a strip of LATINUM out of his 	ear.					DAX			Your head's full of latinum.	She hands him the latinum with a smile and then heads 	for the door. Bashir stands and applauds.					BASHIR 			Ladies and gentlemen: The Amazing 			Jadzia Dax!	Dax gives a mock bow on her way out. Bashir smiles and 	picks up his drink. Quark is not amused. He pockets 	the latinum... waits a beat... and then puts a hand to 	his ear just in case there are any more strips in 	there...									CUT TO:           DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - 08/30/95 - TEASER           3.2    INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	SISKO is waiting as Dax ENTERS. He's serious, a man 	about to deliver some potentially disturbing news.					SISKO			Have a seat.	Dax sits and Sisko moves to sit on the edge of the desk 	close to her.					SISKO				(continuing) 			A Trill science team is on its way 			to the station. They're coming to 			conduct field tests on an 			experimental technique for 			creating artificial wormholes.					DAX 			Sounds interesting.					SISKO			It's an important project and I've 			agreed to let them use the Defiant 			for their experiments.				(beat) 			But I thought you should know that 			the leader of the Trill science 			team... is Doctor Lenara Kahn.	Dax sits back in her chair and we can see that she's 	caught completely off-guard. She's shocked and can't 	quite decide exactly how she feels at this moment, but 	tries to maintain her usual calm.					DAX			Kahn? Lenara... Kahn?					SISKO 			That's right.				(gently) 			You have about three months worth 			of leave accumulated. Why don't 			you take some of it? We can get 			along without you for a while.					DAX				(wry) 			Am I that dispensable around here?					SISKO				(joking) 			We won't even notice you're gone.	Dax smiles a little, but lets out a long breath and 	makes her decision.           DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - 08/30/95 - TEASER           4.2    CONTINUED:					DAX 			No. I'll stay.  I can handle it.					SISKO			You sure?					DAX			I'm sure. I've never let my past 			lives interfere with my job and 			I'm not going to start now. I'll 			be fine.					SISKO			Okay.					DAX			But thanks for giving me the 			option.					SISKO			Any time... old man.	Dax smiles and then EXITS.									CUT TO:3    EXT.

AIRLOCK CORRIDOR	Dax is waiting outside the airlock as WORF and KIRA 	arrive.					DAX 			They... just finished docking.	Kira and Worf nod and wait for the door to open. Kira 	notices that Dax seems a little distracted.					KIRA			Something wrong?					DAX			No.	But before Kira can pursue the matter any further, the 	airlock doors OPEN and a male Trill scientist in his 	50's named PREN steps out.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/30/95 - TEASER         5.4    CONTINUED:					PREN 			I'm Doctor Hanor Pren of the Trill 			science ministry.					KIRA			I'm Major Kira Nerys, and I'd like 			to welcome you to Deep Space Nine. 			This is our strategic operations 			officer, Commander Worf, and of 			course our science officer, 			Commander Dax.	Worf nods to Pren and Dax shakes his hand. Just then, 	two more Trill scientists, BEJAL -- a man in his mid-	thirties, and LENARA KAHN -- a striking woman about the 	same age, ENTER from the airlock. Dax stiffens 	slightly, but keeps her emotions tightly under wraps.					PREN			Allow me to introduce our team 			leader Doctor Lenara Kahn and her 			brother Doctor Bejal Otner.				(introducing them to the				Trill)			Major Kira, Commander Worf, and			Commander Dax.	Everyone shakes hands and says hello... then comes the 	moment when Dax and Lenara finally face each other 	squarely. This is an awkward moment for both of them 	that they're trying very hard not to show.					DAX			It's been a long time.					LENARA 			Yes, it has.	They hold each other's gaze just a fraction of a second 	too long, and Kira takes notice. Dax and Lenara break 	the moment and turn back to the others.					WORF 			If you will come with me, I'll 			show you to your quarters.	Worf heads off down the Corridor and the Trill 	scientists follow him. Dax hangs back and Kira stops 	her for a moment.					KIRA 			You know that woman?           DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - 08/30/95 - TEASER           6.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX			Oh, I know her.				(beat)			She used to be my wife.	Kira reacts as we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/30/95 - ACT ONE        7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)5    INT. QUARK'S	Quark, Bashir, and Kira are at the bar. Quark is 	struggling to make sense of Dax's Trill backstory.					QUARK 			So let me get this straight. 			Dax's first host was named Lela. 			Right?					BASHIR 			I think so.					KIRA			Lela Dax, that's right...					QUARK 			Then Lela dies and the Dax 			symbiont goes to a man named... 			Tobin. And after Tobin dies, then 			it's on to Emony... then...				(trying to remember)			... Torias.... Audrid...					KIRA 			No, no. Audrid, then Torias.					QUARK 			Sorry. Audrid, Torias, Joran, 			Curzon... and then finally Jadzia.				(Bashir nods) 			And this Doctor Lenara Kahn person 			was once married to... ? 					BASHIR			Torias.				(beat) 			But of course she wasn't Lenara 			in those days.  					QUARK 			I knew it couldn't be that simple.					BASHIR 			The Kahn symbiont that's now 			joined to Lenara, used to be 			joined to a woman named Nilani. 			It was Nilani who married Torias 			Dax.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/30/95 - ACT ONE        8.5    CONTINUED:					KIRA			But Torias was killed in a shuttle 			accident...					BASHIR 			And so Nilani became a widow. 			Years later, when she died, the 			Kahn symbiont was joined to 			Lenara.	An N.D. Ferengi Waiter moves behind the bar and begins 	mixing some drinks.					QUARK 			And now... Nilani is Lenara, and 			Torias is Jadzia. So that makes 			Lenara Jadzia's ex-wife.					KIRA			It's a little more complicated 			than that, Quark.					QUARK 			I'm sure it is. But to be honest, 			I'm sorry I brought the whole 			thing up. It's giving me a 			headache.					BASHIR 			Must be all that latinum rattling 			around in there.	Quark gives him a dirty look, then Bashir reaches out 	and seems to pluck a strip of LATINUM from Quark's ear.					BASHIR 			I was right. You really should 			have that looked at.	The N.D. Ferengi Waiter looks surprised and he leans in 	close to peer into Quark's ear, looking for more 	latinum. Quark glares at him.					QUARK				(deadly)			Get back to work.	The Waiter hurriedly returns to his job. Kira and 	Bashir are clearly amused, but Quark isn't.					QUARK				(to Bashir & Kira)			If you'll excuse me...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/30/95 - ACT ONE        9.5    CONTINUED:	(2)	Quark heads off with an annoyed expression. Bashir and 	Kira take their drinks and head for a table of their 	own.					KIRA				(to Bashir) 			Dax teach you that?					BASHIR				(nods) 			Next time I want to pull a rabbit 			out of his ear.	They sit down.					KIRA			One thing I don't understand is 			why Dax and Lenara can't just... 			pick up where they left off. I 			mean, if they're still in love 			with each other --					BASHIR 			Ah, but there's the rub. Even if 			they do harbor feelings for each 			other, it's strictly against the 			rules of Trill society for them to 			acknowledge it in any way.					KIRA			The "rules?"					BASHIR 			It's more of a... taboo, really. 			Having a relationship with a lover 			from a past life is called, 			"reassociation," and the Trill 			feel very strongly that it's... 			unnatural.					KIRA			Unnatural? How can it be 			unnatural for a married couple to 			resume their marriage?					BASHIR 			The whole point of joining is to 			allow the symbiont to accumulate 			experiences over the span of many 			lifetimes. But in order to move 			on from host to host, the symbiont 			has to let go of the past... let 			go of parents, children, siblings, 			even spouses.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/30/95 - ACT ONE 10-11.       5    CONTINUED:	(3)					KIRA 			I don't understand how two people 			who've fallen in love, and made a 			life together, can be forced to			just... walk away from each other 			because of some... taboo. 				(beat) 			There must be some Trill that 			"reassociate" with people from 			their past.					BASHIR 			I asked Dax the same question. 			And it seems there have been a few 			cases...					KIRA			And what happened?					BASHIR 				(grim) 			They were exiled from the Trill 			homeworld.					KIRA			That would mean their symbionts 			would never be joined to new 			hosts.					BASHIR 			Exactly. When the hosts die, the 			symbionts would die with them. 				(beat) 			So you see, however Dax may feel 			about Lenara, she's not going to 			risk that. To a joined Trill, 			nothing is more important than 			protecting the life of the 			symbiont. Nothing.	Off Kira's thoughtful look on this grim truth...									CUT TO:        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/30/95 - ACT ONE       12.6    OMITTED7    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Re-establishing the station.8    INT. DAX'S QUARTERS	Dax is fixing her hair in a mirror, while wearing black 	pants and a black t-shirt. Her dress uniform is on a 	nearby chair and she's running a little late. The door 	CHIMES.					DAX 			Come in.	Sisko, wearing his dress uniform, ENTERS.					SISKO			I had a feeling you weren't going 			to be ready. I don't think Curzon 			was ever on time in his life. He 			was even late for his hundredth 			birthday party as I recall.					DAX			You're never going to let me 			forget that are you?					SISKO			Do you know how long I planned 			that party?					DAX			Three months. I know.	She finishes with her hair and Sisko picks up the	uniform coat and helps her into it. (There's no	combadge on the coat.) Dax begins to fasten the coat	while checking herself in the mirror.          DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - 08/30/95 - ACT ONE          13.8    CONTINUED:					SISKO 				(casual) 			It's still not too late to back 			out of this reception, you know.					DAX			You know me. I hate to miss a 			party.					SISKO			I'm serious.					DAX			I know. And I appreciate what 			you're trying to do... but I'm 			going to be working with Lenara 			for the next week, so I better get 			used to being around her.	Dax finishes with the coat and grabs a combadge off a 	table and puts it on. She turns and gives him a 	confident smile.					DAX 			Stop worrying about me, Benjamin. 			I'll be fine.	Sisko glances down at her combadge which is upside 	down. He reaches out and fixes it for her. They share 	a wry smile and then head for the door.									CUT TO:9    INT. WARDROOM	A short time later. The formal reception is in full 	swing, and Bashir, Kira, ODO and Worf are here in  	their dress uniforms, along with a few N.D. Bajoran  	Dignitaries, and a couple of N.D. Starfleet Officers.  	At the moment, Sisko is making a toast to the Trill  	science team -- Bejal, Pren, and Lenara, also in formal  	attire -- and everyone has a glass of champagne. Dax  	is watching from a discreet distance away.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/31/95 - ACT ONE       14. 9   CONTINUED:					SISKO				(to scientists)			... so in the spirit of 			friendship, we welcome you to Deep  			Space Nine and wish you success in  			creating the galaxy's first  			artificial wormhole.	Everyone clinks glasses and wallahs "Here, here" as 	they drink a toast. The party now breaks up into more 	casual groupings as people begin to talk among 	themselves.9A   ON KIRA, WORF, BEJAL & LENARA	Who form a small conversation group.					LENARA				(to Worf) 			I understand you'll be commanding 			the Defiant during our experiments.					WORF			Yes.	Worf is content to leave it at that, but the two Trill 	are trying to make small talk.					BEJAL				(to Worf) 			You must be very excited.				(off his look) 			To... be a part of a potentially 			history-making project.					WORF			I am... looking forward to it.					LENARA				(with a smile) 			I think Mister Worf is less than 			enthusiastic about commanding a 			research mission. It's not 			exactly what every Klingon dreams 			about.					KIRA				(light)			What do Klingons dream about, 			Worf?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/30/95 - ACT ONE      14A.9A   CONTINUED:	Worf is a little tired of having his tail twisted. He 	fixes Kira with a deeply serious look.					WORF				(very serious) 			Things that would send cold chills 			down your spine and wake you in 			the middle of the night. Believe 			me... it is better that you do 			not know.	He glowers at them for a moment, impressing them with 	his seriousness, then moves off. As soon as he turns 	away, we see just the slightest hint of a smile play 	about his lips.					KIRA			I can never tell when he's joking.					LENARA				(with humor) 			Maybe it is "better that we do not 			know."	Off their faces as they share a small laugh...9B   ON DAX & ODO	as they talk.					DAX			I thought you liked parties, Odo.					ODO			I enjoy parties that are given for 			my friends. But these diplomatic 			receptions... welcoming 			receptions... good-bye receptions... 			it all seems...					DAX			Unnecessary?					ODO			Exactly. I've never understood 			the humanoid obsession with 			bringing together groups of people 			and forcing them to interact 			socially.	Dax notices that Worf has gotten himself a drink and is 	off by himself.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Rejoined" - REV. 08/31/95 - ACT ONE      14B.9B   CONTINUED:					DAX			Not all humanoids enjoy these 			functions.	Odo follows her gaze and watches as a smiling Bajoran 	diplomat approaches Worf, ready to make small talk. 	Worf gives the man a "find someone else to talk to" 	look and the diplomat makes a hasty retreat.					ODO			Hmm.
