HOLOSUITE - CAVES	Worf and DAX are fighting with the short sword and the	bat'leth, respectively. Worf is wearing his workout	gi, while Dax has on a much tighter-fitting leotard.	They're both pretty good, and the match is even until	Worf locks the hooked edge of his sword around the	longer blade of Dax's bat'leth and then BREAKS her	weapon in two. He steps forward and puts the point of	his sword against her chest.					WORF				(touche)			E-cha!	Dax bows her head in defeat and the match is over.					DAX				(I lose)			Movek.				(beat)			Okay. I see your point. The			mek'leth does have its advantages.			But I still say that the longer			reach of the bat'leth is usually			the deciding factor.	Worf picks up a towel and hands one to Dax.					WORF			That is the classic argument.			However, I find that using a large			and intimidating weapon like a			bat'leth often leads to... 			overconfidence.					DAX				(amused)			So you think I was overconfident?	Worf gives her a look, thinks for a beat.					WORF			You were overconfident. You			thought that by... distracting me			with your outfit you would gain an			advantage.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - TEASER       2.1    CONTINUED:	Dax gives him a confused look.					DAX			My outfit... ?	Worf is suddenly caught off-guard -- he completely	misread the situation.					WORF				(flustered)			I... I thought that... I mean,			assumed that you were...					DAX			You thought I wore this... for			you? Talk about overconfidence.	Dax heads for the door shaking her head. Worf can't	believe how much of his foot he stuck in his mouth.	Then Dax pauses, and turns back with a mischievous	smile on her face.					DAX			Worf. E-cha.	Worf turns, sees the smile and realizes that he's been	had.					WORF			Movek.	Dax laughs a little and even Worf can see the humor in	the situation. He chuckles a little despite himself.					DAX			But in my own defense, I will say			that you try your own tactics of			distraction. All that shouting			and growling you do.					WORF			I am only vocalizing my --					ODO'S COM VOICE			Odo to Worf.					WORF				(to com)			Worf here.					ODO'S COM VOICE			Please report to Airlock Five,			Commander.

Bajoran Security guards are	confronting KURN -- Worf's brother -- at the Airlock.	Kurn is drunk, weaving unsteadily and holding a knife	in his hand. He also looks like hell, even for a	Klingon -- clothes torn, hair unkempt, face dirty --	wherever he's been, it hasn't been pretty. (NOTE: Kurn	is not wearing a Klingon uniform. He has been	disgraced and now only wears Klingon civilian garb.)	Odo and the Guards are watching him carefully, the	Guards with their hands on their weapons, but not	pressing Kurn. It's a stand-off for the moment.					KURN				(slurred)			Stay back... you... you miserable			koruts...					ODO			Easy... none of us koruts are			going to hurt you...	Worf ENTERS from the adjacent corridor and reacts to	the sight of his brother.					WORF			Kurn!					KURN				(slurred)			Worf... I knew you would come...	Odo gives Worf a questioning look.					WORF			He is my... brother.	At the sight of Worf, Kurn seems to have forgotten his	hostility. He manages to smile and lets Worf approach	him.					KURN			The sons of Mogh reunited... one			last time.	Worf reaches out and easily takes the knife from Kurn's	hand. The Guards relax a little.					WORF			Kurn, where have you been? I've			been trying to reach you for			months.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - TEASER       4.2    CONTINUED:					KURN			Well... I'm here now. But not for			long.

SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing the station.4    INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	Kurn is passed out on a couch, snoring softly and	covered with a blanket. Worf is sitting in a nearby	chair, watching his brother sleep. Worf's been sitting	here for hours and he's lost in thought. A GLASS	filled with some kind of liquid sits on a table nearby.	Kurn finally begins to stir, but it takes Worf a second	or two to shake himself out of his own reverie as his	brother struggles to wake up.					KURN				(bleary)			Guard... I need something for my			head... guard!					WORF				(softly)			You are not in a holding cell,			Kurn. You're in my quarters.	Kurn blinks a few times, looks around, manages to focus	on Worf finally. Worf gestures to the glass.					WORF				(re: glass)			For your head.	Kurn picks up the glass and drinks down the liquid. It	gives him some relief as he sits up and tries to brush	the cobwebs away. He looks at the couch and then the	room with disdain.					KURN				(re: couch)			Soft... comfortable... just like			the rest of these quarters... no			one would ever suspect that a			warrior lives here...					WORF			It suits my needs.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT ONE       6.4    CONTINUED:					KURN				(bitter)			Always defending the Federation.			Tell me, Worf... doesn't Starfleet			ever make mistakes? Even in their			furniture?	Worf eyes him coolly, refusing to rise to the bait.					WORF			Where have you been, Kurn? It's			been four months since your last			message.	Kurn gives him a sour look, gets up and moves about the	room a little stiffly.					KURN			I've been... overseeing the end of			a once-proud house. You may have			heard of it -- it was called the			House of Mogh.	Worf's reaction is one of sadness and resignation...	he's known about all this for quite some time, but this	is the first time he's had to face directly the	consequences for his brother.					WORF			I know what has happened. And			I... regret that by opposing			Gowron, I have brought disgrace to			our family.	Kurn looks at him and then laughs bitterly. Worf	stiffens a little, not used to being scorned by his own	brother.					KURN				(laughing, scornful)			You "regret?" What's next, Worf?			Do you want to "apologize" to me?			Express your "sympathy?" How many			human weaknesses will you display?	Kurn is definitely pushing Worf's buttons here, but	Worf manages to contain his anger.					WORF			I do not apologize for what I have			done. I could not join Gowron in			his war against Cardassia, or			against the Federation. It would			have been... dishonorable.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT ONE       7.4    CONTINUED:	(2)					KURN			So in avoiding dishonor for			yourself, you brought it on the			rest of your family. What a noble			act... how selfless.					WORF				(hard)			I will not debate this with you,			Kurn. What is done... is done.					KURN				(hard)			For you it's done! You and your			comfortable Federation life and			your glorious Starfleet career.			But not for me.	Worf can't argue with that and looks away for a	moment... Kurn drops his voice and looks out the window	as he thinks back on what has happened.					KURN				(continuing)			Our family had a seat on the High			Council. We were feared by our			enemies. Respected by our			friends.				(beat)			It was even said that if Gowron			died... the leadership of the			Council might have passed to			someone from the House of Mogh.	Kurn turns and looks at Worf with astonishment.					KURN				(quiet)			Then you chose to side with the			Federation against the Empire.			Gowron took our lands... our			ships... our seat on the			Council... everything.					WORF			Kurn, I know that this has been			difficult for you...					KURN				(anguished)			What do you know? Did you watch			as Gowron's men seized our lands			and stripped our family of its			name?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT ONE       8.4    CONTINUED:	(3)					KURN (Cont'd)			Did you have to endure the			humiliation of being ejected from			the High Council in front of the			Emperor himself?	Kurn looks away... the humiliation of it all almost too	much for him to bear.					KURN			No... you stayed here. Safe.			Comfortable. Secure. You have			everything you want... and I have			nothing. Not even my honor.				(beat)			But you can give that back to me.					WORF			By killing you?					KURN			I am already dead to our people!			So are you, but you don't care.				(beat)			I have never asked you for			anything. But you took my honor,			and only you can give it back. So			now, I am asking you for Mauk-			to'Vor. Is an honorable death so			much to ask from my brother?	Kurn looks at him with pain and anger written across	his face.

Is it possible they			were using live torpedoes in a			battle simulation?					WORF			Unlikely. Even the most reckless			Klingon commander would consider			that... extremely unwise.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FOUR     37.32   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			On the other hand, our scans of			the Drovana's hull do point to an			external source for the explosion.			From the fracture pattern of the			damage, I'd say something exploded			about ten kilometers off their			port quarter.					DAX			But torpedoes leave ion trails,			and the Defiant didn't pick up any			in the vicinity.					KIRA			And the Drovana was cloaked --			even Klingon torpedoes can't track			vessels operating under cloak.	Worf suddenly realizes what's going on.					WORF			Mines. They hit a mine.	There's a shocked beat as that thought rockets around	the room.					O'BRIEN			That's why there aren't any ion			trails...					DAX			And cloaked mines can't be			detected by any known sensor			array.					SISKO			That's what they've been doing out			there -- laying a minefield just			outside Bajoran space.					KIRA			But there've been at least a dozen			ships moving in and out of the			system since the explosion. Why			haven't they struck any mines?					WORF			The type of mine currently used by			the Klingons remains dormant until			it's armed by a coded subspace			signal.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FOUR     38.32   CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN			The mine that damaged the Drovana			must've malfunctioned or been set			off prematurely.					DAX			If we're right, there could be			thousands of mines out there right			now and we'd have no way of			knowing it.					BASHIR			Mining a star system is an act of			war. I didn't think the Klingons			were ready for that.					SISKO			At the moment, we can't even prove			these mines exist.				(beat)			But if war comes, the Klingons			would be able to cut off Deep			Space Nine and the entire Bajoran			system.	A beat as that sobering thought sets in.					KIRA			How do we find these mines?					DAX			Unless we know their coordinates,			there's no way to find them until			we run into one.					O'BRIEN			Then we better get those			coordinates.					KIRA			Well, the place to get them is			docked at Upper Pylon Three right			now. The only question is... how?	Beat.					WORF			I have an idea...									CUT TO:      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FOUR    38A.32A  INT. WORF'S QUARTERS 	Kurn (in his Klingon civies) looks outraged. Worf has	just presented him with his plan.					KURN			You want me to... turn against my			own people? Will my dishonor			never end?					WORF			It is their actions that are			dishonorable, Kurn. Secretly			mining star systems is not the act			of warriors -- they are behaving			like Romulan cowards.					KURN			Is that how you rationalize this?			By calling your people cowards so			you can be a hero?					WORF			I am no hero. But it is my duty			to defend the Federation -- that			is where my honor lies.					KURN			Maybe it is where your honor lies.			But why should I betray our people			for your honor?	The situation with Kurn is getting more and more	difficult for Worf. He struggles to keep a grip on his	temper and takes a moment to clear his thoughts.					WORF			Kurn... let me ask you this: do			you agree with what has happened			between the Empire and the			Federation?					KURN			It is not my place to criticize			the decisions of--					WORF			Answer the question!	Kurn is stung -- he's not used to hearing that tone of	voice from his brother. But he backs off and then	answers the question.					KURN			I... opposed the decision to break			the treaty. But I was overruled			in Council.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FOUR    38B.32A  CONTINUED:					WORF			Why did you oppose the decision?					KURN			Because Gowron underestimates the			Federation... he thinks they're			soft... weak. He's wrong. And			sooner or later... there will be			war.					WORF			A war the Empire may lose.					KURN				(grudging)			Yes.	There's a beat as Worf moves to Kurn and makes his case	to him quietly and forcefully.					WORF			You know that mining this system			is just the beginning... if we do			nothing, it will only encourage			Gowron to continue thinking of the			Federation as weak. Eventually he			will attack. And that will be the			end of the Empire.				(beat)			That is why you must join me on			this mission, Kurn. Not for my			honor... not for the			Federation... but to prevent the			Empire from being destroyed in a			war they cannot win.	This argument hits home with Kurn, and he's beginning	to see that Worf is right.					WORF				(continuing)			Our people have turned their backs			on us... but we have not turned			our backs on them. Let it be --			the Sons of Mogh, side by side,			saving our people.				(beat)			Do this with me.	Off Kurn's face as he makes a fateful decision...      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FOUR     39.33   INT. SURGERY (OPTICAL) 	There are TWO unconscious Klingon warriors lying on the	bio-bed tables. Worf is wearing a Klingon uniform and	sitting on the edge of a table while BASHIR applies a	small hand-held medical DEVICE to his face. The device	is producing SCARS on Worf's face as BASHIR works.	Worf is nearly unrecognizable with the scarring and	with his hair down in the wild Klingon style. Two N.D.	Nurses are helping BASHIR.	Kurn is standing in the b.g., also wearing a Klingon	uniform.					BASHIR				(finishing, to Worf)			There. Very ugly.				(joking)			Uglier, that is.	Worf looks up at him, and the smile fades from Bashir's	face.					BASHIR			A joke.					WORF			I got it.	Bashir picks up another DEVICE from the table and	begins applying it to one of Worf's hands.					BASHIR			This will temporarily alter your			DNA signature to match one of...				(re: unconscious				Klingons)			... our friends over there. It			should be good enough to pass a			cursory scan.					WORF			How long will it last?					BASHIR			About four hours.					WORF			That should be sufficient.					BASHIR			Kurn.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FOUR     40.33   CONTINUED:	Kurn is looking at his uniform and adjusting its fit.	This is how he should look -- a Klingon warrior.					BASHIR			Kurn?	Kurn snaps out of his reverie.					KURN			Yes, Doctor?					BASHIR			If you'll have a seat...	Kurn nods and sits down on the table as Worf gets up.	Bashir begins working on Kurn's face...									CUT TO:34   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE & DROVANA (OPTICAL)	The Klingon ship is still docked at the pylon.35   INT. KLINGON CORRIDOR (OPTICAL) 	A couple of N.D. Klingons pass through the corridor and	when it is empty, Kurn and Worf MATERIALIZE. They	quickly get their bearings and then start walking down	the corridor.36   ANOTHER CORRIDOR	As Kurn and Worf round the corner, an N.D. Klingon	Soldier bumps into Worf. Worf lets it go and begins to	walk off, but the Soldier turns and looks at him	suspiciously. Kurn immediately slams the soldier	against the wall.					KURN			Do-sho ka-chee Ha-de-bahk! (Out			of our way, idiot!)	The Soldier drops his eyes in acquiescence and then	heads off down the corridor.					KURN				(sotto, to Worf)			You're on a Klingon ship. Start			thinking like one!      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FOUR     41.36   CONTINUED: 	Worf nods -- he made a mistake. They continue on down	the corridor and finally come to a door with a security	panel next to it. Worf puts his hand up on the	security panel and ACTIVATES it. There's a tense	moment as he waits for the security panel to do	something... and a couple of Klingons happen to walk by	at that moment... Worf and Kurn act casual, hoping not	to attract attention to themselves... but then the	blinkies on the panel finally LIGHT UP and the door	OPENS. Worf and Kurn EXIT through the door.37   INT. KLINGON COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS	As Worf and Kurn ENTER the small room and the door	slides CLOSED behind them. The room is filled with	Klingon computer consoles and equipment and it should	appear like a normally unmanned space on the ship.	Worf and Kurn quickly head for one of the consoles and	begin working the controls. Worf pulls out a Klingon	tricorder.					KURN			The deployment plan for the mines			should be in the defense system			database...					WORF			I've found the main file			directory...					KURN			Ignore it. It's a new security			procedure the High Council			instituted three months ago --			false directories, files, entire			databases of disinformation			designed for spies to steal.				(beat)			Here. This is the real			database...					WORF			Can you access the deployment			plan?					KURN				(working)			Most of my security codes have			been changed... but not all of			them... yes!	At that moment, the door suddenly OPENS and a KLINGON	OFFICER ENTERS.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FOUR     42.37   CONTINUED:					KLINGON OFFICER			What are you doing?	Kurn and Worf look up in shock. They've been caught.	Off the tense moment...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FIVE     43.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:38   INT. KLINGON COMPUTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Continuous from Act Four. Worf and Kurn being	confronted by the Klingon Officer. Worf and Kurn both	look irritated, both trying to bluff their way out of	the situation.					KURN			We are running a diagnostic on the			computer core. There have been			power fluctuations in the			navigational control system.					KLINGON OFFICER			I have not been informed of any			computer problems.					WORF			Perhaps you have not been tending			to your duties.					KLINGON OFFICER			I do not know you. What is your			name?	Worf stands, moves to him, the two men toe-to-toe.	Kurn watches carefully from behind Worf.					WORF			I am Commander Sorval... son of			M'tokra.					KLINGON OFFICER			How long have you been aboard...			commander?	Worf explodes in anger.					WORF			I will not be questioned by a			Lieutenant who should be cleaning			my quarters. Leave us or I will			have you stripped of your rank and			sent home on a transport!	The Klingon officer narrows his eyes at Worf's anger,	but he appears to back down.					KLINGON OFFICER			My words were ill-chosen,			commander.     DEEP SPACE 14INE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FIVE     44.38   CONTINUED:					KLINGON OFFICER (Cont'd)			Perhaps I can help in your			investigation.					WORF			That will not be necessary. All			that we require is that you--	Suddenly Kurn grabs Worf by the arm, spins him out of	the way, and SHOOTS the Klingon Officer dead with his	disruptor. Worf is surprised.					WORF			You didn't have to do that! He			was backing down...	But by now Kurn has bent down next to the dead Klingon	Officer, turns his hand over... and in the palm of the	Klingon's hand we see a small knife.					KURN			He was going to kill you.	Worf is stunned, but there's little time to dwell on it	right now.					WORF			We must hurry. The disruptor			blast will alert their security			sensors.	Worf turns back to the console, quickly works it and	his Klingon tricorder. As Worf works, Kurn can't help	but look down at the dead Klingon Officer... he's	deeply troubled by what he's done.					KURN				(quiet)			He was a warrior... doing his			duty... defending the Empire.			And I killed him...				(beat)			My dishonor is complete.	Worf looks up at the shattered expression on his	brother's face, then forces himself to get back to	work.									CUT TO:      DEEP SPACE NINE: "The Sons of Mogh" - 12/15/95 - ACT FIVE     45.39   INT. WARDROOM	The wall monitor has a large SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM of the	KLINGON MINEFIELD surrounding the Bajoran system.	Sisko, Kira, Dax and O'Brien are sitting at the table,	looking at the diagram. Worf is standing next to the	wall monitor -- he's just finished his briefing.					WORF			... since we now have the			detonation codes for each mine, we			can set them off individually or			all at once.					SISKO			Thank you, Commander.				(to Kira)			Major?					KIRA			We'll take care of it.	She looks at O'Brien and the two of them EXIT together.	Worf turns off the wall monitor.					SISKO			Congratulations, Mister Worf.

That goes			for your brother, too.					WORF			Thank you, sir.	Sisko EXITS, leaving Dax and Worf alone.					DAX			You don't seem very pleased.					WORF			I am still troubled by the...			death of the Klingon officer.					DAX			Your report said it was self-			defense.					WORF			That's not the point.

And he was three			meters away.	Dax tries to make him feel a little better.					DAX			Worf... I don't know if you can			tell someone's going to kill you			just by looking at them.					WORF			A Klingon can. It is instinct...			the ability to look into someone's			eyes and see the decision to kill.				(beat)			An instinct I no longer have.	Worf takes a few steps around the room, as suddenly	things fall into place for him.					WORF			Kurn is right.
