GARAK'S SHOP	ODO ENTERS to find GARAK folding some outfits at the counter.					ODO			You wanted to see me, Garak?					GARAK			Constable, how good of you to stop			by.	Garak's eyes glance over at one of the dressing rooms.					ODO				(quietly)			Shoplifter?	Garak looks back at Odo in confusion.					GARAK			Excuse me?				ODO			Is something wrong?	Before Garak can answer the dressing room door/curtain 	is flung open and out steps an attractive Bajoran woman 	in her late thirties. This is AROYA. She's wearing a 	sexy alluring dress, but there's nothing obvious or 	overstated about her like a dabo girl. She's a 	restauranteur, accessible but classy. She twirls to 	show off the dress.					AROYA			What do you think?					GARAK,			"A thing of beauty is a joy			forever."					AROYA			Put it on my account. I'll wear			it to work.					GARAK,			A splendid idea.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken... " - REV. 04/19/96 - TEASER        2.1    CONTINUED:	Aroya just stands there, smiling at Garak. Garak 	remembers why he's asked Odo here.					GARAK			Security Chief Odo, allow me to 			introduce Chalan Aroya. One of my 			best customers.	Aroya walks over and takes Odo's hand.				AROYA			I own the Celestial Cafe. The new 			Bajoran restaurant overlooking 			the Promenade.					ODO			I'm familiar with it.					AROYA			I watch you walk by every morning 			on patrol. Oh nine thirty-seven. 			You're very precise.					ODO				(out of his element)			How... nice of you to notice.	It's beginning to dawn on Odo that Garak has set him 	up. The only reason he's here is to meet this woman. 	He looks over at Garak who smiles innocently.					AROYA			I was hoping one day you might 			stop in. When you're not working.					ODO			I don't eat.					AROYA			I do. And I hate to eat alone. 			Think about it.	She starts to leave, then turns around.					AROYA				(with a farewell smile)			And next time you're on the Second 			Level, don't forget to say 			"hello."	She EXITS. Odo turns to Garak, and looks at him 	accusingly.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken...

You 			should be locked away for that.					ODO			You humanoids. You're all 			obsessed with these convoluted 			mating rituals of yours.					GARAK			True. But do you think we'd waste 			so much time on something that 			wasn't worthwhile?				(a beat)			I'll never understand you. You're 			such a curious man, yet there're 			so many aspects of humanoid life 			you simply refuse to explore.	This whole subject is making Odo distinctly uncomfortable.					ODO			I have no desire to become a slave 			to humanoid obsessions.					GARAK			But you have to admit, she was 			quite lovely.					ODO				(reluctantly)			She was, wasn't she?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken...

He doubles over, then 	looks up at Garak and lets out a horrible groan.	Suddenly, waves of Shape-shifter goo ripples throughout 	Odo's torso. Odo is overcome by pain, as each 	successive wave seems to hit him harder than the last 	one. Finally, his whole body ripples and Odo collapses 	to the floor.	Garak's immediately at his side.					GARAK				(hits Odo's combadge)			Garak to Doctor Bashir. I need a 			medical emergency team sent to my 			shop, immediately.	And as Garak looks down at Odo's unconscious form, we...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken... - REV. 04/19/96 - ACT ONE                                      ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)3    INT.

He feels 	helpless and there's nothing he dislikes more than 	feeling helpless.					ODO 			Doctor, this is a waste of time. 			You don't know enough about 			changeling physiology to diagnose 			what's wrong with me. No one does.					BASHIR 			Actually, I do have some idea 			what's going on. I've compared 			your current medical scans with 			ones I've made over the last four 			years and there're noticeable 			differences.				(referring to readouts)			Normally when you're in humanoid 			form, you have a specific density 			of one point four which is 			consistent throughout your body. 			Your mass and density only vary 			when you change shape. But right 			now, your mass and density are in 			a state of fluctuation.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken... " - REV. 04/19/96 - ACT ONE        6.3    CONTINUED:					ODO			Do you know what's causing it?					BASHIR			No.					ODO			Do you know how to prevent it from 			happening again?					BASHIR			Not yet.					ODO				(rising)			Then tell me when you do.	Bashir gently places a restraining hand on Odo's chest.					BASHIR 			I'm afraid I can't let you leave 			just yet. Moving seems to 			increase the fluctuations. And 			that could bring on another 			attack.					ODO			Are you saying that I have to lie 			here until you discover a cure?					BASHIR			or until the fluctuations stop on 			their own. For all I know, this 			could be a normal biological 			process, the changeling equivalent 			of puberty or menopause.					ODO			That's an interesting theory. 				(with an edge)			One I suggest you keep to 			yourself.					BASHIR			Don't worry. It could just as 			easily turn out to be a virus or 			a bacterial infection.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken...

He's not convinced Bashir can make good on 	his promise.4    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.5    INT. WARDROOM (OPTICAL)	Close on the monitor which displays an image of GOWRON, 	the chancellor of the Klingon Empire, giving a 	political speech. Gowron's controlled, assured and 	confident. These aren't the ravings of a madman; 	they're the words of a calculating, uncompromising 	dictator.					GOWRON				(on monitor)			We find the Federation's demands 			that we return the captured 			Cardassian colonies insulting and 			provocative. Klingon blood was 			spilled to conquer those worlds.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken... " - REV. 04/19/96 - ACT ONE        8.5    CONTINUED:					GOWRON (Cont'd)			They are now part of the Klingon 			Empire and we will never give them 			up.6    REVERSE ANGLE (OPTICAL)	On SISKO, KIRA, DAX and WORF, somberly listening to 	Gowron's polemic.					GOWRON				(on monitor)			Furthermore, if the Federation 			still harbors any hope of peaceful 			coexistence with the Klingon 			Empire, it must abandon all 			Starbases and military 			installations in the Archanis 			Sector. Our claim to Archanis 			Four and the surrounding territory 			is ancient and indisputable. We 			advise the Federation to leave 			Archanis, or prepare to face the 			consequences. Long live the 			Empire.	And with that, the image of Gowron is replaced by the 	Seal of the Klingon Empire.7    NEW ANGLE	As Sisko reaches over and deactivates the monitor. For	a moment, everyone's quiet as they ponder Gowron's 	words.					SISKO 			This recording was sent to the 			Federation Council three days ago.					WORF			If Gowron is willing to go to war 			over the Archanis Sector, then he 			has become even more dangerous 			than I thought.	Kira is still stewing over Gowron's demands.					KIRA			I don't get it. The Klingons 			relinquished their claims to 			Archanis Four a hundred years ago.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken... " - REV. 04/19/96 - ACT ONE        9.7    CONTINUED:					DAX			I guess they changed their minds.					SISKO 			I don't think Gowron gives a damn 			about Archanis. He's just looking 			for an excuse to rattle his sabre. 			The question is... why?					DAX			Yesterday I talked to an old 			friend of Curzon's in the 			Diplomatic Corps. She says 			representatives from Federation 			worlds near the Klingon border are 			already urging a preemptive 			strike.					KIRA			Sounds like war may be inevitable.					SISKO 			I hope you're wrong, major. But 			right now, there's not much we can 			do about it either way. Archanis 			Four is a long way from here.	Suddenly Kira bursts into a staccato series of sneezes.					DAX				(counting)			Two, three... I say she stops at 			seven.					SISKO				(quickly)			I'll go eight. Mister Worf?					WORF			Ten.	Kira continues the short violent sneezes until she 	reaches eight, then rears back her head like she's 	going to have another, waits, and finally...					KIRA			I hate being pregnant.					SISKO			I win.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken...

Human women get 			nauseous. We sneeze. 				(a beat)			Besides, I think Doctor Bashir has			his hands full right now.	Sisko exactly knows what she means.					SISKO 			How is the constable?	Kira looks worried.					KIRA			Still no news. I was thinking of 			going to visit him.					WORF			I doubt he'd want to be seen in 			such a weakened state.					DAX			What if he wants some company? 			Someone to take his mind off his problems?					WORF			That is doubtful. Odo values his 			privacy. He doesn't like to 			socialize.					DAX			I think that's just an act.					WORF			It's not an act. He told me so 			himself.					DAX			But you were socializing with him 			when he said it.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Broken...

I think.	Sisko thinks for,a beat, trying to decide whether 	visiting the constable will do more harm than good.					SISKO				(back to Odo)			Hopefully Odo will be back on his 			feet soon. In the meantime, I 			want him left alone to rest. 			Agreed?	Kira starts sneezing again.					SISKO				(as if that's his answer)			Agreed. 8   EXT.

Right now he 	just wants to be left alone.					ODO			To be honest, major, I don't 			really feel like company right 			now.	Kira doesn't take it personally.					KIRA			I didn't plan on staying. 				(holds out a PADD)			I came to give you this.	Odo looks at the PADD and for the first time, he 	brightens.					ODO			Today's criminal activities 			report?					KIRA			I figured you might be getting 			tired of staring at medical 			consoles all day.	Odo smiles and immediately starts reading the reports.					ODO			That was very... thoughtful of 			you, major.					KIRA			If there's anything else you need, 			let me know.	Odo nods, engrossed in the report.					ODO			I'll do that.	Kira looks at Odo for a beat.

In some places it 	looks relatively normal, in others it's an ill-formed 	mass of goo.
