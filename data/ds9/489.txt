I			mean... we talked about it and			decided we'd start trying.					O'BRIEN			I know. But your last visit...			you were only here one night. I			thought it would take a couple			more nights. To be honest, a lot			more nights.					KEIKO			I guess we just got lucky this			time...	O'Brien sees the need for reassurance in his wife's	eyes and musters a smile...					O'BRIEN			I guess so...	Off this unexpected reunion...        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - TEASER        3A.4    INT.

We hear sporadic SHOUTS of "Emissary" from the	crowd.

Vedek Porta is present, acting as	Akorem's assistant.					SISKO			I wanted to talk to you before you			left for Bajor.					AKOREM			Of course.					SISKO			I was surprised by your speech.			I had no idea you were going to			advocate change on such a massive			scale.					AKOREM			It's what the Prophets want for			Bajor. It's why they sent me.					SISKO			You're sure of that?					AKOREM			Absolutely.					PORTA			The Emissary knows that what he's			proposing will be difficult for			some people to accept; he doesn't			expect things to change overnight.					SISKO				(to Akorem)			So you're not planning to ask			First Minister Shakaar to step			down and go back to farming?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT TWO       23.25   CONTINUED:					AKOREM			Of course not. But, frankly, by			the next election, I doubt			there'll be many people left on			Bajor who would elect a farmer to			political office.					PORTA			It's our hope that eventually, the			people will support enforcement of			the D'jarras by legal sanction.					SISKO			So if someone defies their			caste...					AKOREM			Society will have appropriate			remedies at it's disposal. Such			as deportation.	Sisko considers how best to put what he wants to say.					SISKO			You realize that caste-based			discrimination goes against the			Federation charter. If Bajor			returns to the D'jarra system, I			have no doubt its petition to join			the Federation will be rejected.					AKOREM			Kai Winn and I have already			discussed it. We're willing to			make that sacrifice in order to			follow the will of the Prophets.	Sisko is not surprised to hear this.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT TWO       24.25   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			I had a feeling Winn would see it			that way.	Sisko is deeply troubled by the thought that something	he's worked for for three years could go down the drain	in one swoop, but it's not his place to say so.					PORTA			Well... the Emissary's transport			leaves shortly.	Akorem and Porta stand, ready to go.

That's mine.	Keiko looks as if she's trying to picture him in it.					O'BRIEN			Don't worry. I only wear it in			the holosuites.					KEIKO			I suppose Julian has one, too.	She puts the Kilt on a chair, moves to him. Molly uses	the fact of O'Brien's distraction to go back to what	she really wants to be doing, COLORING on paper.					KEIKO			You two certainly spent a lot of			time in the holosuites.					O'BRIEN				(pulling her close)			You should be glad. Kept me out			of trouble.					KEIKO			Remind me to thank Julian next			time I see him.	Keiko smiles, strokes his hair... and they kiss. When	they part, O'Brien casts a glance at Molly, then	inclines his head toward the bedroom in a "do-you-think-	she'd-notice?" gesture.					O'BRIEN				(quiet)			What do you say we try for			twins... ?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT THREE      40.41   CONTINUED:	(2)					KEIKO				(smiling)			I don't think that's the way it			works.

I'll play with Molly.	A warm look between them...					KEIKO			It's good to be home, Miles...	He smiles, and Keiko moves off to collect the things	she needs for her work. O'Brien moves to get the	darts.					O'BRIEN			Come on, Molly. Let's play darts.					MOLLY			I don't wanna.	O'Brien is a bit disappointed, but decides to roll with	it.					O'BRIEN			Can daddy color, too?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT THREE      41.41   CONTINUED:	(4)					MOLLY				(absorbed in her work)			I'm coloring.	Keiko glances up from her work and sees O'Brien's	face... he knows that Molly is just being a kid, doing	exactly what strikes her fancy, but he's left with	nothing to do...	Keiko watches as a O'Brien sits there on the floor for	a beat, trying to convince himself that he's not bored.	After a beat, he turns and looks at the kilt on the	chair... his features almost wistful...	Off Keiko as she takes this in...42   INT.

Anything else?	Kira takes a breath, steels herself for something	difficult.					KIRA			I was wondering if you might have			time in the next few days to meet			with Major Jatarn.					SISKO				(brusque)			Sure.					KIRA			Is something wrong, sir?	Sisko lets out a frustrated breath.					SISKO			Sorry. I just got a communique			from Starfleet Command responding			to my report on the Bajoran			situation.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT THREE     41A.42   CONTINUED:					KIRA			That bad?					SISKO			Not yet. But I can read between			the lines.	He gets up, moves around the room as he talks.					SISKO			I was sent here to help bring			Bajor into the Federation. That			doesn't look like much of a			possibility anymore, so as far as			Starfleet's concerned, I've failed			my mission.					KIRA			That's not fair. It's not your			fault.					SISKO			It is from where they're sitting.	Sisko is struck by a thought.					SISKO			The ironic part is that Starfleet			was always trying to get me to			distance myself from "that			Emissary business." And now that			I have...	Sisko shakes his head, struck by the irony.					KIRA			Maybe I could talk to First			Minister Shakaar about sending			Starfleet a communique explaining --					SISKO				(interrupting)			Thanks, but, it'll blow over.			It's not that.				(beat)			I guess I'm just feeling that...			I did fail.

She doesn't want to do	this, but feels she must.					KIRA			I think held make an excellent			first officer.				(off Sisko's look)			As soon as you find someone to			take my post, I'm going to resign			my commission.	Sisko is stunned... sits heavily...					SISKO			So you can follow your D'jarra...					KIRA				(trying to make the best				of it)			I'm planning to move back to			Dahkur province... a lot of			artists live in the capitol.

The last thing I want			to do is add to your problems...			but this is something I have to			do.	Sisko tries to keep the emotion from his voice because	he doesn't feel it's his place to dissuade her.					SISKO			I understand.	They look at each other, both wanting to say more...	she: "I don't want to do this... " he: "please don't...

She made me read it three			times before she fell asleep.	Keiko smiles distractedly, keeps working. O'Brien	flops down on the couch, looks around for something to	do... but can't think of anything and lets out an	unconscious sigh. Keiko looks up.					KEIKO			I'm going to be working for			another few hours.					O'BRIEN			That's okay... I'll...	He picks a PADD off the coffee table, tries to sound	enthusiastic.					O'BRIEN			Read...					KEIKO			If you want to go do something...					O'BRIEN			I'm fine.	She shrugs a smile, gets back to work. A quiet	moment... then O'Brien lets out another unconscious	sigh as he reads.					KEIKO			Miles... I promised I wouldn't say			anything... but...				(coming out with it)			It's Julian.					O'BRIEN			What about him?					KEIKO			I ran into him the other day			and... he seemed depressed.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT FIVE       57.63   CONTINUED:					KEIKO (Cont'd)			He'd never admit it, but he really			misses you.					O'BRIEN			Poor guy... no family to come home			to every night.					KEIKO			Why don't you go find him? You			know... cheer him up.	O'Brien tries to contain his excitement.					O'BRIEN			Depressed, is he?					KEIKO			Very.					O'BRIEN			Maybe I should spend an hour with			him.					KEIKO			Maybe two.	He's up in a flash, grabs his Bomber Jacket, and heads	for the door. Before he ducks out, O'Brien regards	Keiko for a moment.					O'BRIEN			I'm a lucky man.	She smiles, and O'Brien EXITS... Keiko lets out a	relieved sigh, then activates a DESKTOP COMPUTER.					KEIKO			Keiko to Doctor Bashir.									INTERCUT WITH:64   INT. INFIRMARY	as Bashir responds. He's working alone at his desk.					BASHIR			Go ahead.					KEIKO			Julian, it's about Miles. I			promised I wouldn't tell anyone,			but he's been really depressed			lately.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT FIVE       58.64   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Oh?	Off Keiko's smile as she continues putting her plan	into motion...65   INT. QUARK'S 	where Sisko is at a table reading a PADD.	SUPERNUMERARIES as needed. Kira approaches him from	behind and sets a CLAY BIRD similar to the one she made	in Scene 37B down in front of him.					KIRA			I want you to have this.				(taking a seat)			It's an original Kira Nerys...				(wry)			-- could be very valuable some			day.					SISKO				(playing along)			I hear she didn't make that many.	They share a smile...					KIRA			I thought your speech went well			yesterday. It was the right thing			to do.					SISKO			I wanted people to know what			happened to Akorem... and that the			Prophets said nothing about			returning to the D'jarras.					KIRA			I think almost everyone was			relieved to hear it...	Just then, O'Brien and Bashir pass by in full Irish	warrior regalia.					O'BRIEN			Why didn't you back me up?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT FIVE       59.65   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			How was I supposed to know you			were going to insult the King of			Leinster in his own keep?	They pass out of hearing range and belly up to the bar.	Sisko and Kira exchange a smile.					SISKO				(re: PADD)			I was just reading one of Akorem's			poems: The Call of the Prophets.	Kira nods as if it were one of her favorites.					KIRA			That was always one of my			favorites. It's a shame he never			finished it.					SISKO			He did.	Kira reacts with surprise.					SISKO			Look...	Sisko hands the PADD to her. She glances at it for a	beat, confused by the implications.					KIRA			This is very confusing... the last			time I read this poem it ended			after the twelfth stanza.				(trying to make sense of it)			If the timeline's been changed...			then why do I remember things the			way they used to be?	Sisko shrugs a smile.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Accession" - REV. 1/17/96 - ACT FIVE       60.65   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			The Prophets work in mysterious			ways.	Kira can't argue with that. Just then a Bajoran	Lieutenant of about forty, ONARA, approaches their	table, his DAUGHTER of fourteen at his side.					ONARA			Excuse me, sir.					SISKO			Yes... ?					ONARA			I'm sorry to bother you, but...			tomorrow, after evening services			in the Temple...				(with pride)			-- we're having my daughter's			ih'tanu ceremony.	Onara can see from Sisko's look that he doesn't know	what this means exactly.					ONARA			She's turning fourteen.					SISKO			Happy Birthday.					ONARA			We were wondering if there was any			chance you could come and give her			your blessing. It would mean so			much to us.	Kira looks to Sisko, expecting to see him wince, but to	her surprise he breaks into an utterly sincere grin.					SISKO			I'd be happy to.					ONARA			Thank you, Emissary.	Sisko reacts to being called Emissary, as if accepting	it for the first time.					SISKO			You're welcome.	Father and daughter move off and Sisko returns to	reading Akorem's poem... off Kira's smile as she	studies the Emissary's face...									FADE OUT.                        END OE ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
