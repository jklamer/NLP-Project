Offer him			a tour of the station.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			I already have. His time is			limited and he's anxious to meet			with the Emissary.	SISKO sighs, seeing he can't put him off.						SISKO			I'll be right there.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shattered Mirror" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT ONE     7.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					JAKE				(to Jennifer)			So why are you here?					JENNIFER				(slightly embarrassed)			I came to see your father.	Jake is really pleased at that admission.					JAKE			Really? That's great.	It's an awkward moment for Sisko; he doesn't want Jake	leaping to conclusions.					SISKO			Jennifer came to give me some good			news. The Terrans have won an			important victory.					JENNIFER			We've driven the Alliance off the			space station.					JAKE				(realizing the				importance)			Then the rebels control Terok Nor.					JENNIFER				(with an approving				glance toward Sisko)			I see your father has told you all			about us.	Sisko, aware of an attraction between Jennifer and	himself, decides to play it down.					SISKO			I'd better get to this meeting.					JENNIFER				(smiling)			I understand.

That would be nice.	Jennifer gives Jake her empty cup. As she does, their	hands touch. Jake takes the opportunity to hold onto	her hand lightly.					JAKE			That's amazing.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shattered Mirror" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT ONE     9.10   CONTINUED:					JENNIFER			What?	Jake, still holding her hand, studies it intently.					JAKE			I never thought I'd hold this hand			again... it feels just like my			mom's.	Jennifer allows Jake the moment.

The Minister looks	pleased at the outcome of the meeting.13   INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	KIRA stands at the door watching the Minister depart.	She turns to Sisko who is coming around from his desk.					KIRA			That went well. I think you made			it clear to the minister why the			Emissary can't endorse his land			reform program.					SISKO				(frustrated)			It only took me three hours.	Kira picks up a PADD.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shattered Mirror" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT ONE    10.13   CONTINUED:					KIRA			If you like, we can go over the			weekly personnel reports.					SISKO			In the morning.

SISKO'S QUARTERS 	The captain hurriedly ENTERS, stops. The room's empty.					SISKO			Jake? Jennifer?	Sisko checks the other rooms, they're not there.					SISKO				(to com)			Computer. Locate Jake Sisko.					COMPUTER VOICE			Jake Sisko is not on the station.	A puzzled Sisko notices an odd-looking (TECH) device	lying conspicuously on the table.

OPS (OPTICAL)	Sisko, O'BRIEN, Kira and DAX are gathered around the	Ops table. O'Brien is evaluating the (TECH) device	Jennifer left Sisko. He's opened a small panel on the	device and is poking its innards.					O'BRIEN			You're sure this is what Smiley			used to transport you to the			alternate universe?					SISKO			Looks like it.					DAX			And you're convinced Jake's gone 			over there?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shattered Mirror" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT ONE    11.15   CONTINUED:					SISKO			He's not on the station and			neither is Jennifer.					KIRA			Maybe he convinced her to take him			there for a visit.					SISKO			Without asking me?					DAX				(re: the device)			It could be why she left this			behind. It's an invitation to			join them.					SISKO			And I accept -- if only to get			Jake back.					KIRA			You want some company? I can			think of safer places to visit.	Sisko agrees.					SISKO			Major, you and the Chief, come			with me.				(to Dax)			Commander, you have Ops.	Sisko takes the (TECH) device and heads for the	Transporter pad. Kira goes to a weapons locker and	takes out two phasers, one for herself and one she	hands to O'Brien.					O'BRIEN			Expecting trouble, Major?					KIRA			Just want to be prepared.	She takes out another phaser for Sisko.16   ANGLE ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)	Sisko steps over to the transporter console and runs	the device over it, exactly like O'Brien did in	"Through the Looking Glass."    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shattered Mirror" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT ONE    12.16   CONTINUED:	Sisko steps on the transporter pad, joining Kira	and O'Brien.					SISKO			Energize.	The transport beam comes on but to the surprise of all,	only Sisko DEMATERIALIZES.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we are	now in the parallel universe, and that Ops now looks	like it did in "Crossover." Ops is manned by rebel	troops. O'Brien, aka "SMILEY" is leaning up against a	nearby railing, obviously waiting patiently for Sisko's	arrival.					O'BRIEN			Welcome back, Captain.					SISKO				(looking around for Kira				and O'Brien)			What happened to the others?					O'BRIEN			They weren't invited.	Sisko steps off the transporter pad.					SISKO			Where's my son?					O'BRIEN			With Professor Sisko.

TEROK NOR - INTENDANT'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)	O'Brien is seated in the Intendant's chair. This is a	somewhat different O'Brien than we've seen before; he	possesses the quiet confidence and focus of a leader.	Sisko stands across the table from him, reining himself	in, impatient to know what's going on with his son. In	the b.g., the two rebel guards are still present.					O'BRIEN			Terok Nor in rebel hands... it			goes to show what people can do			when their cause is just.					SISKO			Save the speeches, Smiley. Right			now, I don't care too much for you			or your cause.					O'BRIEN			You've every right to be angry.			After all, we haven't exactly			played fair with you.					SISKO			You kidnapped my son.					O'BRIEN			Kidnapped... an ugly word.					SISKO			But accurate.					O'BRIEN			Tell me, Captain... if we'd come			to you and asked for help in			fighting the Alliance, what would			you have said?					SISKO			I'd have said, no.					O'BRIEN				(exactly)			Which is why we had to use your			son to lure you over here.			Because we do need your help,			Captain. No one else will do.	O'Brien moves across the room and taps a console by a	large screen.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shattered Mirror" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT TWO    15.18   CONTINUED:	The screen comes alive with a SCHEMATIC of the Defiant.					O'BRIEN			Recognize her?					SISKO				(the last thing he expected)			The Defiant.					O'BRIEN 			During our last encounter, when I			"visited" your station...				(pleased)			...

The			Alliance fleet is already on its			way and when they get here, I want			to give them a proper welcome.	Sisko looks over the blueprints carefully. He	understands what O'Brien has in mind.					SISKO			These schematics look complete.			If you want to build another			Defiant, you don't need my help.					O'BRIEN			We've already built her. But			every time we power up the			engines, the whole ship damn near			shakes itself apart.					SISKO			We had the same trouble. It's a			powerful ship.					O'BRIEN			Well, right now it's a little too			powerful for its own good. So how			did you solve the problem?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shattered Mirror" - REV. 2/15/96 - ACT TWO    16.18   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			We had to overhaul the structural			integrity field grid.					O'BRIEN			How long did it take?					SISKO			Two weeks.					O'BRIEN			We have four days.					SISKO			I'm not sure that's enough time.					O'BRIEN			It'd better be -- or the Defiant			won't be ready and you and your			son will die along with the rest			of us... or worse, spend the rest			of your lives working in the ore			processing center under the tender			mercies of an Alliance overseer.	Sisko can see the box that he's in all too clearly.					O'BRIEN 			Help us, captain, and I promise			we'll get you and your son out of			here before the fireworks begin.				(a beat)			The Defiant is at Docking Port			Five. I think you know the way.					SISKO			I want to see Jake first.					O'BRIEN 			I knew you would.	O'Brien and Sisko head for the door, it opens to REVEAL	BASHIR. The rebel victory has inflated his already	bloated opinion of himself. This Bashir never walks,	he swaggers.					BASHIR				(to O'Brien)			Is he with us?	O'Brien stares at Bashir; it's apparent there's no	great love between these two men.					O'BRIEN				(to Sisko)			You remember Captain Bashir.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Shattered Mirror" -REV. 2/15/96 - ACT TWO    17.18   CONTINUED:	(3)					SISKO			Captain?					O'BRIEN				(amused)			Captain Bashir, Captain O'Brien,			Captain Sisko.

O'Brien steps between them before	Sisko can retaliate.					BASHIR			I owed you that. I let you hit me			once because I thought you were			our Captain Sisko. Now I know			better.	Sisko steps up to Bashir -- staring at him calmly.					SISKO			We're even now.	Sisko EXITS. HOLD ON O'Brien and Bashir.					O'BRIEN			If I were you... I'd stay out of			his way.19   INT. QUARK'S	Rebels scattered eating and drinking. This is a more	raucous bar than we're used to. Leaning against the	bar, with a dabo girl on each arm, is NOG.
