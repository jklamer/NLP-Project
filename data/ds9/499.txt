OPS	Close on a tense WORF, who's staring in frustration at 	a monitor.					WORF			Where are they? They should've 			been back hours ago.	O'BRIEN looks just as worried as Worf. Everyone in 	Ops, including Major KIRA, is on edge. There's a war 	going on and their commanding officer is somewhere in 	the middle of it.					O'BRIEN 			Maybe the meeting with Starfleet 			Command took longer than they 			thought it would.					KIRA			Then why haven't Sisko or Dax 			contacted us?					O'BRIEN			The whole area they're traveling 			through is crawling with Klingon 			ships. The second they used their 			subspace transmitters, they'd 			become a target.	Worf is angry with himself and the situation.					WORF			I never should've let them leave 			in a runabout. I should've 			insisted they take the Defiant.					KIRA			You did. But the captain's orders 			were clear.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

I say we take the 			Defiant and go looking for the 			captain.					O'BRIEN				(to Kira)			I'm with Worf.					KIRA			I'm glad the two of you are in 			agreement. But with the captain 			gone, I'm in charge of the 			station, and I say we stay. 					WORF			You may be in charge of the 			station, major, but I command the 			Defiant.	But Kira's not going to be persuaded.					KIRA			Mister Worf, the captain has given 			us our orders and I intend for us 			to follow them until he issues new 			ones.	But O'Brien has spotted something on one of his 	consoles.					O'BRIEN 			Hold on a minute. I'm reading a 			warp signature approaching the 			station.	That immediately gets Kira and Worf's attention. They 	check their own panels.						WORF			It's the Rio Grande.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	Sisko ENTERS, followed by Dax and Kira.					KIRA			It's hard to believe one 			changeling could cause so much 			chaos.					DAX			He can if he's impersonating the 			leader of the Klingon Empire.					KIRA			So is Starfleet going to do 			something about "Chancellor 			Gowron" or not?					DAX				(not enthused)			Oh... they're going to do 			something.	Kira looks at Dax and Sisko for more specific 	information.					SISKO			Starfleet's sending an 			infiltration team into Klingon 			territory. Their orders are to do 			whatever it takes to prove 			Gowron's a Shape-shifter.	Kira knows that this is probably a suicide mission.					KIRA			Tough assignment.

The waiters 	are no longer Ferengi and the Writ of Accountability is 	still on the wall, but other than that, everything's 	back to normal. QUARK is in a good mood, rushing 	around, seeing that no glass is left unfilled.15   NEW ANGLE	As Sisko ENTERS, joining Quark at the bar.					QUARK				(delighted)			Captain, you're just in time for 			Happy Hour.					SISKO			Do I look happy, Quark?					QUARK			Do you think any of these people 			looked happy when they walked in 			here? How could they? There's a 			war going on. But they come 			because they know I'll do 			everything in my power to help 			them forget their troubles. For 			a reasonable fee, of course.				(a beat)			Now what can I do for you?					SISKO			I'm looking for Odo.	This takes some of the wind out of Quark's sails.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

QUARK'S SECOND LEVEL	ODO is sitting at a table by himself, staring into a 	glass of Bajoran Ale, seemingly oblivious to the 	raucousness around him. He's not drunk or wallowing in 	bitterness, but there's a palpable aura of defeat to	him. Sisko joins him.					SISKO			Constable.	Odo holds up a restraining hand.					ODO			Listen, Captain. Do you hear it?	Odo nods toward a glass of Bajoran Ale that sits in 	front of him. Sisko, not sure what this is all about, 	sits down and leans closer to the bottle.					SISKO			You mean the bubbles?					ODO			Soothing, isn't it? You know, 			before I became a Solid, I never 			heard that. I didn't have a sense 			of taste so I never paid much 			attention to food, or drink. I 			had no idea how seductive they 			could be.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

But now that I've 			gotten used to it, I find eating 			and drinking to be quite 			comforting. It's one of the few 			things you...				(correcting)			... we humanoids have control over.					SISKO			Not necessarily. There's always 			the temptation to eat too much... 			to drink too much...					ODO			One has to find something to do 			with one's time. And for some 			reason, my work isn't as 			fulfilling as it used to be.					SISKO			I might be able to do something 			about that. Starfleet has ordered 			us to try to expose the Gowron 			changeling. I want you to come 			with us.					ODO			Maybe it would be better for you 			to take Deputy Yndar. There's 			nothing I can do that he can't.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse... " - REV. 07/19/96 - ACT ONE     10.16   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			I don't need Yndar. I need you.					ODO			What you need is someone who can 			turn into Gowron's pet targ.

WARDROOM	Sisko, Kira, Dax, O'Brien, Worf, BASHIR and Odo are 	gathered around the briefing table.					SISKO			According to Starfleet 			intelligence, Chancellor Gowron 			has relocated Klingon military 			headquarters to Ty'Gokor.					WORF			That will make our job more 			difficult. Ty'Gokor is located in 			an asteroid field deep in Klingon 			Space. It is probably the most 			heavily fortified installation in 			the Empire.					SISKO				(agreeing)			There're at least thirty warships 			stationed there at any given time 			and the entire asteroid field is 			protected by a tachyon detection 			grid.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse... " - REV. 07/19/96 - ACT ONE       18   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Which means there's no way to get 			a cloaked ship within transporter 			range.					WORF			Even if we do find a way inside, 			getting close to Gowron will not 			be easy. He is guarded around the 			clock by his personal security 			force, the Yan-Isleth.					DAX				(translating)			The Brotherhood of the Sword.					KIRA			Look, I don't want to sound 			negative, but even if you get to 			Gowron, how can you prove to the 			Klingons he's a changeling?					ODO			I doubt he'll stand still and let 			us take a blood sample.	Bashir nods. He shares their concern.					BASHIR			The Klingons are obsessive about 			blood screenings. If he's lasted 			this long, the changeling 			impersonating Gowron must've 			already found a way around them.					WORF			There is one solution. We could 			kill him.					O'BRIEN			Dead changelings do revert back to 			their gelatinous state.					SISKO			Our orders are to expose Gowron, 			not assassinate him. Which is why 			Starfleet has given us these.19   NEW ANGLE	Sisko indicates to four small emitters and a handheld 	activator set up at the table.

Which means we can 			only expose a person once. Any 			more than that and, changeling or 			not, they'll die of radiation 			poisoning.	Dax deactivates the monitor.					SISKO			The plan is to smuggle these into 			Ty'Gokor. Once they're set up, 			they can cover about twelve 			thousand cubic meters.	Which leaves a lot of unanswered questions as far as 	O'Brien's concerned.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

All 			we have to do is get past an enemy 			fleet, avoid a tachyon detection 			grid, beam into the middle of 			Klingon headquarters and avoid 			the Brotherhood of the Sword long 			enough to set these things up and 			activate them in front of Gowron.					WORF			If we succeed, there will be many 			songs sung in our honor.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

DAMAR, Dukat's former executive officer, is 	seated at the helm.					SISKO				(to Worf)			I see we're all here.					WORF				(nods)			The ship is ready for departure.					SISKO				(to Dukat)			At your convenience, Gul Dukat.	But Dukat doesn't rush to give the order. He's too 	busy happily gazing at Sisko, Odo and O'Brien, who are	all vaguely uncomfortable in their Klingon garb.					DUKAT			Captain, I insist that we make a 			holographic record of the four of 			you. Consider it payment in full 			for the use of my vessel.					O'BRIEN			Maybe after the mission.					DAMAR			After the mission you'll all be 			dead.					DUKAT				(scolding)			Damar.

A 			full spread of photon torpedoes 			would take care of him, the 			Klingon High Command and everyone 			else within a few hundred 			kilometers.	Odo looks at him with distaste.					ODO			You should ask Dukat for some 			shore leave. I think you've been 			in space too long.					DAMAR			Why? Because I'm willing to spill 			a little Klingon blood to get the 			job done?					O'BRIEN			Shelling Ty'Gokor won't get the 			job done. You'd be lucky to 			launch one torpedo before they 			shot you down.

You stand so far 			away from me. You speak so 			quietly. Are you afraid of me... 			or disgusted by my presence?	Sisko gets into O'Brien's face.					SISKO			Klingon warriors speak to each 			other proudly.

THE HALL OF WARRIORS (OPTICAL)	This is a vast, vaulted church-like chamber with 	towering columns carved into statues of famous Klingon 	heroes. The Klingons use it as a combination assembly 	hall, holy shrine and banqueting chamber.	The center of the room is dominated by a large platform 	containing a brazier burning an eternal flame. On 	either side of the brazier are racks on which hang 	Commendation Medals, sigils of the order of the 	Bat'leth and other military regalia.	Right now, the hall is filled with Klingon soldiers, 	gathering for the Ceremony of Commendation.

Everything seems to be 	back on schedule.74   OMITTED75   CLOSE ON ODO	Odo slips his emitter out of its hiding place and 	reaches up to place it on his statue, but just as he's 	about to let it go...76   NEW ANGLE	The Drunken Klingon who was at the wine vat staggers 	out from behind the statue, walking blindly into Odo.					DRUNKEN KLINGON				(in Klingon)			Where's Gowron?	But, by bumping into Odo, the Drunken Klingon has 	forced Odo to let go of the emitter before it's 	properly placed. Odo looks up at the device, just in 	time to see it topple off the statue and fall to the 	floor.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

He's obviously a scarred veteran, and even 	worse, he's cold sober.					TOWERING KLINGON				(accusatory)			This looks like some sort of 			weapon.	He and his friend stare at Odo with rapidly rising 	suspicion. Just then, Worf approaches, acting jovially 	drunk.					WORF				(to Odo)			Kodrak! My brother.	Worf looks around and pretends to spot the emitter.					WORF				(excited)			You found it.	Worf goes to reach for the emitter, but the Towering 	Klingon holds it away from him.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

For children.	Odo catches on and joins in on the bluff.					ODO			The spoils of war. From the raid 			on Archanis.					WORF			If you want one, you'll have to 			find your own.	The Towering Klingon doesn't seem comfortable with the 	thought that he's holding a children's toy. He does 	not protest when Worf takes it from him.	Just then, the sound of massive bass drumming fills the 	air. It's the Klingon equivalent of "Hail to the 	Chief." The Towering Klingon immediately looks off to 	the sound of the drums. once he's no longer paying 	attention to them, Worf hands the emitter to Odo.					WORF			Here. Give it to your son.					ODO			I'll make sure he gets it.	They part ways just as the drumming reaches a crescendo 	and...83   ANGLE ON THE DOOR	As GOWRON ENTERS, wearing his cape, and escorted by two 	Yan-Isleth.

In the background, Gowron raises his hand and the 	crowd falls silent.					GOWRON			Klingon Warriors, I salute you. 			At least, those of you still on 			your feet.	The crowd laughs appreciatively. Behind them, those 	who could not rise are being dragged from the room.88   CLOSE ON ODO	As he approaches his position only to discover a YOUNG 	KLINGON warrior has climbed the pedestal of the statue 	to get a better view. Odo can't set up his emitter.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse... " - REV. 07/19/96 - ACT FOUR    45.88   CONTINUED:	He turns and looks across the room at Sisko.

Gowron picks up a medallion of the Order, 	which is a kind of medal hung on a heavy chain, leans 	over, and places it on the Warrior's neck.90   ANGLE ON O'BRIEN	As he looks from Sisko to Odo, aware that their whole 	plan is slipping through their fingers.					GOWRON			Glory to you and your house.	He gives Gowron a Klingon salute, then steps back. 	The ceremony continues.					MARTOK			Come forward, T'vis, son of Barot.	Another Klingon moves to receive his medal.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

Step down.	The Young Klingon looks down at Odo with disdain.					YOUNG KLINGON			Find another.	The Young Klingon looks back up as the ceremony 	continues.					GOWRON				(in the background)			Glory to you and your house.	But Odo isn't about to engage in a debate. Without 	warning, he grabs the leg of the Young Klingon, upends 	him so he tumbles off the pedestal, and kicks him 	before he can get up.					ODO			That won't be necessary.92   NEW ANGLE	Back on the podium, the ceremony goes on.					MARTOK			Come forward, Huss, daughter of			Altrom.	A female Klingon standing next to Worf steps forward.93   ANGLE ON SISKO	Who looks on with approval as Odo begins to activate 	the final emitter.					GOWRON (O.S.)			Glory to you and your house.	Sisko reaches into his sleeve for the triggering device 	he used in the briefing, but just then...     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

Klingon 	rats... the worst kind.	Martok is standing at the cell door, flanked by two 	Klingon bodyguards. He studies Sisko and the other 	Federation prisoners.					MARTOK			Captain, you don't know how much 			I've looked forward to killing you 			in battle.

Take our polaron 			emitters and use them on Gowron.					MARTOK			Gowron had your equipment destroyed.					O'BRIEN			Of course he did.

Now that he's voiced his suspicions, it all 	comes easier.					MARTOK			I have known Gowron a long time. 			And it is no secret that we have 			not always agreed on the way he 			runs the Empire. He is a 			politician... too eager to 			compromise...				(with contempt)			To talk. Last year, he stopped 			the attack on Deep Space Nine 			instead of going to war with the 			Federation.	Martok stalks the cell like a caged tiger. He's wanted 	to say what he's saying for a long time, and now he's 	energized by his confession.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

Suddenly 			he was the one calling for war.					O'BRIEN			I'd think that would've made you 			happy.					MARTOK			At first, it did. But after the 			war began, he started ignoring the 			counsel of his generals, throwing 			aside all wisdom in his pursuit of 			victory. Our losses continue to 			mount, and still he listens to no 			one.					ODO			No one but the Founders.	Martok considers his options for a long beat, then...					MARTOK			There's only one certain way to 			expose Gowron for what he really 			is. To prove beyond a shadow 			of a doubt that he is a changeling.				(with finality)			Gowron must die.	Odo nods. It's a cruel logic, but it's true.					ODO			Once he's dead, he will revert to 			his natural form and eliminate all 			doubt.					WORF				(to Martok)			You could challenge him to 			honorable combat.	Worf nods. He agrees. But Martok shakes his head. 	He's not as idealistic as Worf.					MARTOK			There will be no honorable combat, 			no formal challenges. I will 			release you, help you reach the 			Hall of Warriors, and then you 			will kill him.	Everyone reacts to Martok's decision.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Apocalypse...

As he walks up to the guards, 	pulls out a pair of Klingon knives, and stabs them both 	simultaneously.	Sisko and the others immediately pull out Klingon 	disruptors. Worf takes out his Mek'leth. Sword in one 	hand, disruptor in the other, he readies himself for 	battle.					MARTOK				(to Worf)			For the Empire.	Worf nods. The two Klingons understand the importance 	of the moment. Martok hits a panel and the door slides 	open.					SISKO			Let's go.	Sisko leads Worf and O'Brien into the room.

He looks surprised and angry.					GOWRON			What is this? 					WORF			It is your death.	Worf leaps up onto the platform and swings at Gowron 	with his Mek'leth.	Gowron dodges aside and grabs his Bat'leth from his 	swordbearer.

The Gowron 	Shape-shifter seems to be putting on a pretty good 	Klingon imitation. Before Worf can decide what to do 	next, Gowron gives a Klingon battle cry, and launches 	himself at Worf. The battle is joined.124  INT. THE CORRIDOR	Martok glances through the doorway in surprise, 	reacting the what he sees.
