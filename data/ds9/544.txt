HOLOSUITE/LAS VEGAS LOUNGE - NIGHT	VIC FONTAINE, a handsome, tuxedo-clad singer, is midway 	through a saloon song, emblematic of the late fifties 	and sixties ("You're Nobody 'til Somebody Loves You"). 	The audience is filled with well-dressed men and women, 	all of them looking like they came right out of a 1962 	rat-pack concert.	In the back of the lounge is a bar, where ODO, KIRA, 	DOCTOR BASHIR, CHIEF O'BRIEN, DAX and WORF are standing 	in their Starfleet uniforms. Everyone seems to 	appreciate the music, but Bashir and Dax are the most 	enthusiastic.	Vic finishes the song to a round of applause.					VIC			Hey, it's been four hundred years 			but that little number still works 			for me.2    ANGLE ON THE SENIOR STAFF	as they join in the applause.					BASHIR 			Isn't he incredible?					WORF			I prefer Klingon Opera.					BASHIR				(to the group)			C'mon, I'll introduce you.					KIRA 			To a hologram?					ODO 			Doctor, is this absolutely 			necessary?         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(determined) 			Trust me, he's not like any 			hologram you've ever met.	Julian weaves his way past the tables, as the others 	reluctantly fall in behind him.3    ANGLE ON THE STAGE	as the group approaches Vic.					BASHIR 			That was brilliant, Vic. Really, terrific.					VIC			Thanks, Doc.				(to the others, proudly) 			I know what you're thinking -- he has 			pretty sweet pipes for a light bulb.					DAX			Light bulb?					VIC 			That's what I am, right? A 			collection of photons and 			forcefields... you know, your basic 			heuristic, fully interactive hologram.					O'BRIEN				(to Bashir, re: Vic) 			He knows he's a hologram?					BASHIR 			Felix designed him that way. He 			thought it gave him an attitude that 			was appropriate for the era.					VIC 			If you're going to work Vegas in 			the sixties, you better know the 			score. otherwise, you'll look 			like a Clyde.					KIRA			A Clyde?					VIC 			You know, a Harvey.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - TEASER          3.3    CONTINUED:					WORF			Harvey?					VIC				(don't you get it)			A square -- you know what a square 			is, right?					O'BRIEN 			One side of a cube?					VIC				(giving up) 			I guess that answers my question.	Vic decides it's best to just get past this moment and 	move on.					VIC				(to Bashir, re: the				group)			Where are your manners, Julian?			Aren't you going to introduce me			to your entourage?					BASHIR 			Oh, sorry... Commanders Dax and 			Worf --				(indicating) 			-- meet Vic Fontaine.					VIC 			So, how long have you kids been married?					WORF				(suspicious) 			How did you know we were married?					VIC 			When you sing in as many joints 			as I have, you become a student 			of the human heart.				(looking at O'Brien) 			Don't beat yourself up, pallie -- 			just because you miss your wife, 			doesn't mean you've gone blind.	O'Brien looks at Vic with slightly embarrassed surprise.					O'BRIEN 			What's that supposed to mean?         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - TEASER         3A.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					VIC 			It means there's a lot of very 			attractive ladies in the room and 			it's all right to look at them --			as long as you don't touch.					O'BRIEN				(to Bashir) 			He's good.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - TEASER          4.3    CONTINUED:	(3)	Vic then focuses his attention on Odo and Kira.					VIC			And as for you two --	As he studies them, both Odo and Kira shift 	uncomfortably under his gaze.					ODO			Yes?	But whatever it is Vic sees, he suddenly decides not 	to share it with the others.					VIC			Nevermind. Forget I brought it up.				(to Bashir)			So, you have time for another			song?					BASHIR			Not really. We've got to --				(the would-be hipster)			-- split. Catch you later, Vic.					VIC			You know where to find me.	As they turn to go, Vic calls out --					VIC				(an afterthought)			By the way, this is a high-class			joint. That means coat and ties for			the gents, dresses for the ladies.				(re: their outfits)			You guys look like a trapeze act.	And off Vic's Vegas grin --4    INT. QUARK'S	The gang comes down the stairs from the Holosuites. 	Bashir, holding a isolinear rod, is more than pleased 	with himself.					O'BRIEN			C'mon, Julian -- you must've told			him about Keiko.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - TEASER          5.4    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			I never said a word.				(to the others, enthusiastic) 			Why don't we meet here tomorrow 			night at twenty-one hundred? We 			can listen to Vic's whole set, 			then hit the casinos, play a 			little blackjack, roulette...					DAX				(speaking for Worf) 			We'll be there.				(to Worf) 			Right?					WORF			I still prefer Klingon Opera.	Bashir looks to Kira.					KIRA 			Count me out. I'm leaving for 			Bajor in the morning.					DAX			Oh, that's right -- I forgot. Say 			hi to Shakaar for me.	The mention of Shakaar gets everyone's attention, 	especially Odo's. Kira shoots Dax a look.					DAX 			Sorry.				(to the others) 			Pretend you didn't hear that. She 			doesn't want anyone to know she's 			visiting the First Minister.					BASHIR 			Business or pleasure?					KIRA				(to Dax) 			You see what you started?	Kira walks away from the group. Worf shakes his head 	at his wife.					DAX				(sheepish) 			I said I was sorry.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - TEASER          6.4    CONTINUED:	(2)	And then they, too, walk away.5    ANGLE FAVORING ODO	as he watches Kira EXIT the bar. The thought of her 	going back to Shakaar leaves him feeling miserable. 	But neither Bashir nor O'Brien are aware of his pain.					BASHIR				(to O'Brien)			So, what did you think?					O'BRIEN				(dry) 			About what?					BASHIR			About Vic -- clever, isn't he?					O'BRIEN			Too clever.					BASHIR				(holding up the				isolinear rod)			I tell you, Miles, I owe this man.			If it wasn't for Vic, I wouldn't			be dating Ensign Walker.					O'BRIEN				(skeptical) 			What are you talking about?					BASHIR 			She turned down three dinner 			invitations. I talked to Vic, he 			gave me some... pointers. And 			voila.					O'BRIEN			Julian, are you telling me you 			discussed your love life with a 			hologram?					BASHIR			Vic's not an ordinary hologram. He 			knows about life, love, women...         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - TEASER         6A.5    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(nodding) 			Three things you know nothing about.					BASHIR				(taking umbrage) 			Now that's unfair.					O'BRIEN 			Then why are you asking for advice 			from a light bulb?	Bashir and O'Brien walk over to the bar where Bashir 	hands the isolinear rod to a Ferengi waiter. After 	that, they walk out the door.6    ANGLE ON ODO'S FACE	pondering his friend's words. Right now, he could use 	some advice himself... even if it is from a light bulb.And off this moment, we:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT ONE         7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:7    INT.

You've 			had plenty of time to...				(searching for the right 				words)			... arrange a merger with Kira. 			But in all that time, have you 			even tried to open negotiations? 			No.					ODO				(half to himself) 			It's not that simple.					QUARK 			Odo, the woman waited a year for 			you to make an offer -- any kind 			of an offer.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT ONE         8.8    CONTINUED:					QUARK (Cont'd) 			Face it, you had plenty of 			opportunities and you let them all 			slip away!					ODO				(irritable)			Who asked your opinion?					QUARK				(incensed) 			You did. I came here to talk 			about a missing shipment of groat 			clusters. You're the one that 			started talking about the major.	Odo picks up a PADD, pretends to read.					QUARK 			You want my advice?					ODO 			No.					QUARK				(giving it to him anyway) 			Make it easy on both of us and 			forget all about her.					ODO 			Is that the best you can do?					QUARK 			I'd like to see someone do better.					ODO 			So would I.					QUARK 			You're not exactly the most 			lovable person in the galaxy. 			You're not even the most lovable 			guy in this sector.

SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.10   INT. QUARK'S	Just MORN and the late-night crowd. Even Quark looks 	tired and ready to pack it in. Bashir ENTERS, makes 	a beeline for Quark behind the bar.					QUARK			You're up late, doctor.					BASHIR			I couldn't sleep. I'm feeling a			little tense, actually...					QUARK			I've got just the thing -- one			warp core breach, coming right up.	Quark reaches behind the bar and takes out an ENORMOUS 	glass goblet and begins pouring various liquors into 	the "bowl."					QUARK			Couple of sips of this and you'll			be relaxed for the next three days.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT ONE        10.10   CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(reacting to the size 				of the goblet) 			I'm not that tense. I think I'll 			pop up to the holosuites for a bit 			and --					QUARK				(alarmed) 			The holosuites?					BASHIR			That's right. If you could just 			hand over my new program...					QUARK				(thinking on his feet) 			Sorry, doctor, all the holosuites 			are in use.					BASHIR			At this hour?					QUARK				(what can I say) 			It's been that kind of night.	Bashir doesn't bother to hide his disappointment.					QUARK 			I'm afraid there won't be one 			available for the rest of this 			evening.					BASHIR			That's unfortunate. Oh, well..	Bashir turns to leave.					BASHIR			... maybe I'll wake up Miles -- 			see if he wants to play some tongo.	Once Bashir is gone, Quark sighs in relief. Though 	Quark has no qualms about lying, he's never enjoyed 	lying on someone else's behalf. And as he looks up 	toward the holosuite --									CUT TO:         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT ONE        11.11   INT. HOLOSUITE/LAS VEGAS LOUNGE - NIGHT	Odo and Vic are seated at a table near the stage. 	Nobody else is in the lounge and the chairs have been 	turned over onto the tables. Vic has taken his tuxedo 	jacket off and hung it over his chair. He's sipping 	a drink. Odo looks very uncomfortable; he can't help 	feeling that maybe it was a mistake to come here.					VIC 			I remember back in... must've been 			fifty-eight, I was playing the 			Sands. One night, Frank and Dean 			dropped by and we ended up taking 			over one of the blackjack tables. 			Between the three of us, we 			must've dropped fifteen big 			ones -- and believe me, back then 			that wasn't chump change. So, 			Frankie goes over to the pit boss, 			what was his name --					ODO				(interrupting) 			Look, Mister Fontaine					VIC				(correcting him) 			Vic.					ODO			Vic. These are all very 			interesting stories, but I didn't 			come here to reminisce about your 			past.				(a beat) 			Yesterday, when my friends and I 			were here... you seemed to know 			things.					VIC				(modestly) 			I've been around the block a 			couple of times.					ODO 			I mean specific things. For 			instance, you knew that Dax and 			Worf were married and that the 			chief missed his wife.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT ONE        12.11   CONTINUED:					VIC 			You don't have to be an Einstein 			to clue into any of that.					ODO			At one point, you were going to 			make an observation about Major 			Kira and myself.					VIC 			I thought about it... but I didn't 			want to embarrass anyone -- you 			know, give away any secrets.	Odo zeroes in on this; that's why he's here.					ODO 			Exactly what "secrets" are you 			talking about?					VIC 			C'mon -- do I really have to 			connect the dots? You're crazy 			about the broad. But you're 			afraid to do anything about it. 			And she... well, you know.					ODO			Go on.					VIC 			It's the oldest story in the book. 			She thinks of you as a friend.	Odo shakes his head at what he considers a painful 	truth.					ODO 			I wouldn't call that a secret.					VIC 			But women have been known to 			change their minds.

This isn't the 	ostentatious, gaudy, glitzy Vegas of the seventies and 	eighties, this is the cool, hipster Vegas of the rat-	pack. Clean lines, laid-back, simple elegance and not 	much jewelry on a guy, unless his first name is Sammy.	Vic is over by a wet bar, pouring a couple of drinks. 	Odo is on a stool, still wearing his tuxedo.

The truth is I'm 			a little nervous.					ODO				(surprised) 			You're nervous?					KIRA 			A little.				(smiling) 			I mean it is a first date, right?					ODO			Right.				(a beat) 			There's nothing wrong with being 			a little nervous -- as long it 			doesn't get in the way.					KIRA 			Of what?					ODO			Of enjoying yourself.	Kira isn't used to hearing Odo talk this way.					KIRA 			I thought the only thing you 			really enjoyed was your work.					ODO			How'd you know that?					KIRA				(puzzled) 			You told me yourself.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FOUR       38A.50A  CONTINUED:	(2)					ODO				(to himself) 			Well done, Vic.	Once again, Kira isn't quite sure what Odo's talking 	about.					KIRA 			Vic?					ODO			Never mind.				(getting back to the 				conversation) 			I do enjoy my work. But I'm 			afraid I've used it as an excuse 			to avoid the rest of my life.					KIRA			I know the feeling.	Off screen, we HEAR Vic launch into "I've Got You Under 	My Skin."        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FOUR        39.51   NEW ANGLE	as Vic SINGS directly to them. It's a lovely song, and 	Vic sings it for all it's worth.52   ON ODO AND KIRA	The lyrics are not lost on either of them.					KIRA			Pretty song.					ODO			It is, isn't it?	The moment hangs in the air.					ODO			Are you sure you're not hungry?					KIRA			I'm sure.				(a beat)			So what do we do now?					ODO			Only one thing we can do...	Odo then stands up and holds out his hand.					ODO			Dance with me?	Odo's request is so simple and so direct that Kira 	stands up before she realizes what she's doing.53   ANOTHER ANGLE	as Odo steps away from the table.					KIRA			I'm not sure I know how to dance			to this kind of music.					ODO			Just stay close.	Odo takes Kira in his arms and they begin to slowly 	sway in time to the music.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FOUR        40.54   CLOSER	as they stare into each other's eyes -- not so much 	dreamy, but as if they were looking at each other for 	the first time, as if they were both trying to grasp 	the shock of the new.					KIRA			I had no idea you could dance.					ODO 			It's amazing what you can learn 			in a holosuite.55   ANOTHER ANGLE	as the song continues.					KIRA			I still can't believe we're having 			our first date in here.	Odo is a little thrown by this comment; Vic has 	obviously chosen not to make "Kira" aware she's a 	hologram.					KIRA			I know you wouldn't feel 			comfortable in Quark's, but I know 			one or two out-of-the-way 			restaurants on the station.	Odo doesn't want to burst the hologram's bubble, so to 	speak.					ODO 				(gentle) 			I don't think that's possible.					KIRA			Are you embarrassed to be seen 			with me?					ODO 				(polite) 			I meant it would be "difficult" 			for you to leave the holosuite.					KIRA			Why?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FOUR       40A.55A  NEW ANGLE	as the song comes to an end, an uneasy Vic looks over 	at Kira and Odo. Vic can see things have taken an 	unfortunate turn. As for Odo, he's finding himself in 	a corner with no way out.					ODO			It's complicated.					KIRA			Complicated? To leave the			holosuite? You make it sound like			I'm a hologram.					ODO				(gently)			Aren't you?					KIRA			Is that what you think?	Kira breaks out of his arms. Odo looks to Vic.					ODO			Maybe you should tell her.					VIC				(a sheepish grin)			There's nothing to tell. I'm good,			pallie, but I'm not that good.				(a beat)			You've been dancing with the real			McCoy.55B  CLOSE ON ODO	As Vic's words sink in.					ODO				(shocked, to Vic)			You tricked me.					KIRA				(with an edge)			And me.					VIC			Hey, I brought you two lovebirds			together.				(to Odo)			That was the whole idea, wasn't it?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FOUR 41-42.       55B  CONTINUED:	Odo looks from Vic to Kira -- he doesn't know what to	say. He feels like a total fool.					ODO			Nerys... Kira... Major... I...	Odo doesn't know where to begin, how to explain his 	feelings to Kira. Instead, Odo storms out of the room.55C  ANOTHER ANGLE	as Kira shoots an accusatory look at Vic.					VIC				(anticipating)			Don't say it.				(a beat)			Computer -- end program.56   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as the Vegas world disappears, leaving Kira alone in 	the bare holosuite grid.57   CLOSER ON KIRA	feeling that a very nice evening has taken a very wrong 	turn. And off her regret, we:									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                                 DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FIVE        43.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:58   INT. SECURITY OFFICE	Odo is brooding at his desk.					VIC'S COM VOICE 			Odo? Are you there?					ODO			I have nothing to say to you.					VIC'S COM VOICE 			Look, I know you think I sold you 			down the river...					ODO 				(hard) 			You lied to me.					VIC'S COM VOICE 				(defensive) 			It was for your own good. It was 			time for you to stop playing 			around with holograms and start 			playing around with the real thing.					ODO 			You should've told me it was 			really Kira.					VIC'S COM VOICE 			Would you have shown up if I had?	Odo's silence speaks volumes.					VIC'S COM VOICE 			I don't hear an answer, pallie. 				(a beat) 			If you think about it, there's not 			much to be mad about. I saw the 			way she looked at you while you 			two were dancing. The lady digs 			you. Big time.	The thought of what Kira thinks of him disturbs Odo.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FIVE       43A.58   CONTINUED:					ODO 			She "digs" Shakaar. I can only 			imagine what she thinks of me.				(a beat, embarrassed) 			I kept insisting she was a 			hologram...					VIC'S COM VOICE			Odo, listen to me --					ODO				(cutting him off) 			No -- I'm done listening to you. 			Computer, end transmission.	Odo picks up the PADD, determined to take his mind off 	his problems.

PROMENADE	Kira and Dax walk toward the Replimat.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FIVE        44.59   CONTINUED:					DAX			Are you going to tell me what's 			wrong?					KIRA 			Nothing's wrong. 				(a beat) 			Have you ever had a moment of pure 			clarity? A moment when the truth 			seemed to leap up and grab you by 			the throat?					DAX			I bet this has something to do 			with your visit with Shakaar.					KIRA 			This has nothing to do with 			Shakaar. Now tell me -- have you 			ever had a moment like that?					DAX			One or two. Of course, that's 			over a span of seven lifetimes.					KIRA 			You've had only two moments of 			clarity in seven lifetimes?					DAX			Nerys, total clarity is a very 			rare thing.					KIRA 			I guess so.					DAX			And when it comes, it's important 			that you act on it. Because 			believe me, confusion and doubt 			will take over before you know it.	Kira nods at her friend's wisdom.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FIVE        45.60   NEW ANGLE	as Kira sees Odo emerge from the Security Office. Kira 	gets up to leave.					KIRA 			You're absolutely right.				(a beat) 			It makes perfect sense...					DAX			Don't tell me you're having 			another moment of clarity?					KIRA				(smiling) 			That's two in two days.					DAX			Amazing.	And as Kira reaches a decision --61   INT. PROMENADE	Odo is on the move as Kira comes up behind him.					KIRA 			Odo -- wait.					ODO			Major, if you don't mind, I'd like 			to forget all about the last night.					KIRA			I don't think that's a very good 			idea. We need to talk about what 			happened.					ODO				(still looking for a way 				out) 			Very well. We can meet in my			office in an hour.					KIRA				(shaking her head) 			Let's discuss it over dinner.					ODO			Dinner?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FIVE        46.61   CONTINUED:					KIRA 			You can pick the restaurant -- 			anywhere except a holosuite.					ODO			What about Shakaar? You think he 			would approve?					KIRA			I don't care if he approves or 			not. Shakaar and I are 			friends -- that's all. Friends.	That stops Odo in his tracks.					KIRA 			The First Minister wanted me to 			update him on the war with the 			Dominion. My visit was strictly 			business.				(a beat) 			So... are we going to have dinner 			together or not?	The chemistry between these two is volatile, and the 	rest of this scene is loud and accusatory.					ODO			And if we do, then what?					KIRA 			I don't know... maybe we could go 			dancing.					ODO			And after that, I suppose you'll 			expect me to kiss you.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FIVE        47.61   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA 			It's possible.					ODO			Then who needs dinner?

And as WE PULL BACK, we get the 	feeling that this kiss may never end.65   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Re-establishing.66   INT.

Anytime.	A beat as they shake hands.					VIC 			Feel like sitting in on a number?	Odo smiles, but shakes his head.					ODO 			Some other time.	Vic doesn't push it. Odo turns to leave --					VIC 			Say hi to the major for me. 				(an afterthought) 			Hey, do me a favor?	Odo looks back at Vic.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "His Way" - REV. 2/20/98 - ACT FIVE        49.67   CONTINUED:					VIC 			Leave the program running for a 			few minutes after you leave.
