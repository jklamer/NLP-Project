Their only crime was that			they cared about your people.			But they weren't allowed to help			you because they lost the battle			for heaven and were forced to			flee.					KIRA				(with sarcasm)			I guess the Ancient Texts have it			all wrong, then.					DUKAT			We both know that history is			always written by the victors.			But rest assured, there'll be			another chapter.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Covenant" - REV. 10/14/98 - ACT ONE       9B.7    CONTINUED:	(3)					DUKAT (cont'd)			The Pah-wraiths are determined to			regain their place in heaven.					KIRA			And how would you know that?					DUKAT			They speak to me in visions.				(beat)			I am their Emissary.	Kira chafes at hearing Dukat use the word --					KIRA			I don't know if you believe what			you're saying, if you're faking			it, or if you're just insane.					DUKAT			I was touched by the hand of a			god.
