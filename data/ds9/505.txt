SISKO and ODO are sitting together at a 	table, drinking their morning coffee.					ODO			What do you think of the O'Brien's			plan to name their baby Sean?					SISKO			I kind of like it. "Sean." It's			got a nice ring to it.					ODO			Except in Bajoran it means			"swamp."	Sisko reacts, surprised.					SISKO			Do the O'Briens know that?					ODO			I doubt it.					SISKO			Someone should tell them.					ODO			I nominate you.	Just then, DAX comes over with a cup of raktajino and 	Joins them.					DAX			Morning.	As she sits, she rubs her neck with a groan.					ODO			Neck bothering you again?					DAX			It's just a muscle pull.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He...

The only person 			who's spent more time in the 			Infirmary in the past few weeks is 			Commander Worf.					SISKO			Isn't there any way for the two of 			you to... you know...					DAX			Make love?					SISKO			... without injuring yourselves?					DAX			Interspecies romance isn't without 			it's dangers. That's part of the 			fun.				(brightens) 			Maybe we'll have better luck on 			Risa.					SISKO			Risa? I thought you and Worf were 			going to take your vacation on 			Earth.					DAX			That was Worf's suggestion. I 			changed his mind.					ODO			From what I hear, Risa makes the 			Hoobishan Baths look like a 			monastery.					SISKO			I hope they have a good hospital.				(smiles)			I can't believe you actually 			convinced Worf to go to a pleasure 			planet with you. He must really 			be loosening up.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He...

Extra large.					DAX			See what I mean?	She waves Worf over and he joins them.					WORF			Captain, commander, Constable.	He takes a seat.					SISKO			Dax said you're going to Risa.	Worf look accusingly at Dax.					WORF			Did she?					DAX				(defensive)			It's no secret.					WORF			Apparently not.					ODO			You must be looking forward to it.					WORF			I am "looking forward" to spending 			some time alone with Lieutenant 			Commander Dax.	Dax smiles at this admission.					DAX			Isn't he sweet?	But Worf remains stoic.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

You 			have to learn to trust me a little 			more.					WORF			I trust you. But I do not trust 			Captain Boday.	Sisko and Odo can see that Worf and Dax have some 	issues to resolve, so they look to make a graceful 	exit.					ODO			I can see it's going to be quite 			a trip.					SISKO			You'll have to tell us all about 			it when you get back.					WORF			I'm sure she will.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

Dax can tell that Worf is not too 	happy with her right now.					WORF			I don't see why you feel the need 			to talk about our personal life 			with other people.					DAX			And I don't see why you feel the 			need to control my every move. 				(a beat) 			Besides, they're not "other 			people." Benjamin and Odo are my 			friends.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

We've been looking 			for you.				(to Dax) 			I was thinking about this trip 			you're taking to Risa.	Worf looks over at Dax.					DAX				(defensive) 			He's a friend, too.					LEETA			Julian and I were talking it over, 			and we'd like to come along... if 			that's all right.	Dax looks over at Worf, who does not look pleased.					DAX			Actually, we were hoping for some 			time alone together.					BASHIR			And you'll have it.					LEETA			Once we get to Risa, you'll never 			even see us.	Dax knows Worf wants to say no and makes a preemptive 	strike.					DAX				(to Worf) 			There's no harm in sharing the 			runabout.	Worf isn't happy with this, but he decides not to make 	an issue of it.					WORF			I suppose not.					LEETA				(to Worf) 			Thank you so much.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

Not only is the setting 	beautiful, but the people aren't bad either. Clothing 	is casual to the point of nonexistence, and the mood is 	one of unselfconscious ease and contentment.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

They all 	look around, drinking in the sceneny.					LEETA			I can't believe we finally made			it.	Bashir and Leeta kiss, then they break off their 	embrace and smile at their traveling companions.					BASHIR			Well, enjoy your vacation.					LEETA			We will.	They EXIT. Quark reaches into his sack and takes out 	a pair of horga'hns, gripping one in each fist like a 	gunfighter ready for action.					QUARK			Time to test these babies out.	TWO beautiful, scantily clad RISIAN WOMEN walk by.					QUARK			Oh, ladies.	Quark proudly displays his horga'hns. The Risian women 	approach Quark.					RISIAN WOMAN #1			You seek jamaharon?					QUARK			I seek whatever you've got.					RISIAN WOMAN #2			All that is ours is yours.					QUARK				(in heaven)			I'll take it.	He presents an arm to each woman, they take them, and 	the three walk off together.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

I 			mean, look around you. Isn't it 			beautiful?					WORF			It's an artificially created 			paradise, maintained by the most 			elaborate weather control system 			in the Federation. In it's 			natural state, Risa is nothing but 			a rain soaked, geologically 			unstable jungle.					DAX			Maybe so, but right now the only 			dark cloud I can see is you.					WORF			I did not come here to admire the 			scenery.					DAX			If you say so.	She casually shrugs off her wrap, uncovering even more 	spots.					DAX			I guess we might as well go home.					WORF			I wouldn't be so hasty.					DAX			I take it the scenery has 			improved?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

This is ARANDIS, the Head Facilitator of Temtibi 	Lagoon, which makes her something of a High Priestess 	for Risa's sybaritic lifestyle.	Dax smiles as she recognizes Arandis.					DAX				(excited)			Arandis.

Is there something of hers 			you want?					DAX			Arandis was Curzon's lover, not 			mine.					WORF			I hope you remember that.	Dax realizes what this is all about.					DAX			You're still angry about Captain 			Boday.					WORF			If I am angry, it's because you do 			not take our relationship 			seriously.					DAX			Worf, we just got here. Do we 			have to start arguing again?	Apparently so.					WORF			If you were a Klingon woman, we 			would already be married.					DAX			In case you haven't noticed, I'm 			not a Klingon woman.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

Then I'm going to go have 			a nice big glass of icoberry juice.	Worf tries not to be baited, but he is getting 	exasperated.					WORF			That would be a mistake.

DAX AND WORF'S GUEST CHAMBER - DAY	This can be somewhat similar to Picard's room in 	"Captain's Holiday." It's an airy, bright environment 	with large windows and an abundance of plants (but 	please lose the ceiling fans).	We open close on a skimpy twenty-fourth century 	bathing suit (male), then pull back to reveal Worf, 	looking at it dubiously, trying to think of a way to 	avoid wearing it. Just in the hick of time, the door 	CHIMES. Worf puts aside the bathing suit.					WORF			Come in.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

He 	looks every bit as out of place on Risa as Worf does. 	This is PASCAL FULLERTON. And he's on a mission from 	(a philosophical construct that might be interpreted 	as) God.					FULLERTON			I hope I'm not disturbing you... 				(checks the pips)			... lieutenant commander. My name 			is Pascal Fullerton. I'm the 			Chairman of the New Essentialists 			Movement.					WORF			I'm not familiar with that 			organization.					FULLERTON			We're dedicated to restoring the 			moral and cultural traditions of			the Federation.	Fullerton hands Worf a PADD.					FULLERTON			This is our statement of 			principles.

RISIAN SOLARIUM - DAY	This is a large common room lit by (off screen) 	skylights and subdivided into smaller chambers by	hanging translucent silk curtains. It serves as a 	combination restaurant/lounge/gathering place for the 	Temtibi Lagoon.	There's constant foot traffic winding through the 	different subchambers, which are full of people 	lounging on cushions, doing yoga-like exercises, 	working on art, getting massages or eating sumptuous 	meals. It's not a place to come to for privacy, but 	it's still not uncommon to walk through chambers 	occupied by couples cuddling romantically or find 	someone proudly displaying a horga'hn.	Worf and Dax make their way through the solarium. Dax 	is still dressed in her swimwear, but Worf hasn't yet 	removed his uniform. He's deeply engrossed in reading 	the Essentialists' manifesto, all but oblivious to the 	numerous beautiful bodies (of both sexes) surrounding 	him.	Dax and Worf ENTER another chamber. Here, a woman is 	teaching a man to play a harp-like instrument. She 	reaches her arms around his to guide his hands. Worf 	continues reading the PADD.					DAX			I really wish you'd stop reading 			that.					WORF			I would not dismiss Fullerton so 			quickly. His analysis of recent 			Federation history is insightful. 			And very disturbing.	Dax and Worf pass two scantily clad couples who are 	playing a game that involves balancing on each other, 	shifting into artistically pleasing positions (think 	Cirque du Soleil).					DAX			What's disturbing is that you're 			still wearing that uniform.					WORF			It would not hurt you to read 			this.	Worf and Dax walk through yet another curtain.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

Leeta picks up 	a discussion that's been going on for a while.					LEETA			The truth is, not everyone can be 			a dabo girl. First of all, you 			have to be able to wear the 			clothes, and believe me, that's 			not easy. You have to be able to 			calculate odds in your head very 			quickly, and most importantly, you 			need a very supple wrist.	She roles toward him, exposing her upper body to him 	(but not to the audience), takes his hand and shows him 	how to spin an imaginary wheel.					LEETA			Like this. Dabo.	While Leeta holds her host's hand, Worf and Dax ENTER. 	She's looking at the PADD.					DAX			Worf, people have been predicting 			the end of the Federation since 			the day it was founded. Trust me,			I know...	Dax trails off as she and Worf spot Leeta in this very 	compromising position.					LEETA				(guiltless)			Oh, hi.	Both Worf and Dax are a little taken aback.					DAX			Leeta... what a surprise.					LEETA			Care to join us? We were just 			about to take a reyamilk soak.					DAX			Maybe later.	Dax heads for the nearest curtain, tugging on Worf's 	arm. He follows her.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

This one's 	empty except for a cage with a pair of songbirds. 	Their whistle is soft, compelling and surprisingly 	complex. Closer to music than random notes.	Worf seems to be taking Leeta's dalliance very personally.					WORF			That was not Doctor Bashir.					DAX			Worf, it's none of our business.					WORF			Are you defending her actions?					DAX			I'm not defending anything. It's 			not my business... or yours.				(trying to lighten the mood)			Now what do you say we sign out a 			couple of floaters and take in the 			sights.					WORF			I cannot. The Essentialists are 			having a rally and I'm going to 			attend.					DAX			You're kidding.				(off Worf's look)			You're not kidding.	Worf opens up the curtain and ushers Dax out of the 	chamber.23   EXT.

RISA - TEMTIBI LAGOON - DAY	A surprisingly large crowd is gathering to hear 	Fullerton speak. There is a festive atmosphere as if 	most of the guests see this as just one more 	entertainment. Worf and Dax join the assembly.					DAX				(surprised at the crowd)			Don't these people have anything 			better to do?					WORF			Perhaps you underestimate the 			power of Fullerton's message.	Dax looks around. Something catches her eye.					DAX			The plot thickens.	Worf follows Dax's gaze and sees...25   NEW ANGLE	Bashir standing on the other side on the crowd, arm-in-	arm with a beautiful Risian woman.					DAX			And you were worried about Julian.					WORF			Why are he and Leeta not together?					DAX			I don't know. But don't jump to 			conclusions. I'm sure there's a 			reasonable explanation.	But Worf isn't buying it. He looks over Dax's 	shoulders and sees something he doesn't like.					WORF			This place is a bad influence on 			people.	Dax follows Worf's gaze and sees Arandis approaching 	them from the crowd.					ARANDIS			Here for the show?					WORF			I would not call it a show.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ... " - REV. 09/23/96 - ACT TWO      24.25   CONTINUED:					ARANDIS			Really? I find Mister Fullerton 			very entertaining.					DAX			He seems pretty determined to 			discourage people from coming here.					ARANDIS			Risa receives millions of visitors 			every year. And all of them leave 			happier than when they arrived. 			I don't see how one man, no matter 			how determined, could change that.					WORF			Kahless fought off an entire army 			at Three Turn Bridge. And he was 			only one man.					ARANDIS			Fullerton and his Essentialists 			have been here for almost a month.			And no matter how many speeches he 			gives, the water is still warm,			and the wind still smells sweet. 				(smiles)			But if he's enjoying himself, who 			are we to discourage him?	Suddenly, there's a commotion and Fullerton arrives at 	the gathering, accompanied by a half dozen of his 	followers. It's a mixed group of men and woman, humans 	and aliens, but they stand out from the crowd because 	of their conservative dress and serious demeanors. 	Fullerton walks to the top of a small rise. The crowd 	reacts to his arrival with lighthearted curiosity.					FULLERTON			That's right. Take a good look. 			I can only imagine what you must 			think of me. A middle-aged, 			ponderous academic, sweating under 			the hot Risian suns, wasting his 			time telling you things you don't			want to hear.				(a beat)			But you know what I see when I 			look at you? Children. Pampered 			spoiled children.	During the above, Bashir spots Dax and Worf, kisses his 	Risian companion good-bye, and joins his friends.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ... " - REV. 09/23/96 - ACT TWO      25.25   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR			Am I wrong, or have we just been			insulted?					FULLERTON			Somehow the citizens of the 			Federation have come to believe 			that they're entitled to lives of 			ease and privilege. If you want 			something to eat, you get it from 			a replicator. If you want 			amusement, you go to a holosuite.			And if you need protection, you 			call for Starfleet. But someday, 			someday soon, you're going to have 			to learn to take care of yourselves.	Worf nods his agreement.					FULLERTON			Because if I see you as helpless 			children, then how do you think 			the Borg see you? Or the 			Romulans? Or the Klingons or the			Dominion? These empires look at 			the Federation and they see a			prize, a prize we've forgotten how 			to protect. And if we don't 			change our ways, they're going to 			take it from us.	There's a general murmur from the crowd. Some people 	begin drifting away while others argue about Fullerton's point.					ARANDIS			Mister Fullerton certainly has a 			flair for the dramatic.					BASHIR				(to Dax)			Does he really believe that?					DAX			I think he does.	Fullerton continues to speak.					FULLERTON			The way I see it, we've got two 			options. We can either turn our 			backs on childish things and re-			embrace the hard work that built 			the Federation in the first 			place...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ...

The 			choice is ours. Heaven help us if 			we make the wrong one.26   INT. RISIAN SOLARIUM - NIGHT	Worf, Dax and Bashir are seated around a floor-level 	table (think Moroccan), leaning back on cushions as 	they eat their meal.					BASHIR			Worf, you can't be serious.					WORF			I am merely observing that the 			Klingons never would have attacked 			if they hadn't believed the 			Federation was vulnerable. Even			now, after the changeling on the 			Klingon High Council was exposed, 			some of my people continue to call 			for war. Because they think they 			can win. 					BASHIR			None of which has anything to do 			with Risa.						WORF			You cannot be certain of that.					DAX			All I know is I've spent lifetimes 			defending the Federation, and I 			deserve a vacation every now and 			then.	Just then...					LEETA (O.S.)			Julian.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He...

They 	look to Bashir, who seems genuinely happy to see Leeta, 	despite the fact that they're both with other people.					LEETA			There you are.	She kisses Bashir hello and sits down.					LEETA			I'm so glad we came here. I'm 			having the most wonderful time.					BASHIR			I told you this was just what we 			needed.	Worf can't believe this. Right now both Bashir and 	Leeta seem to be incredibly deceitful people in his 	eyes. He slams his mug down on the table with more 	force than he intended.					BASHIR			Something wrong?					DAX				(cautioning Worf)			It's nothing.	There's a beat, then Worf can't contain himself any 	longer.					WORF			The two of you dishonor each other 			with your actions.					LEETA				(to Bashir)			Do you know what he's talking about?	Bashir's beginning to suspect. He acts as if he forgot 	to do something important.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He ... " - REV. 09/23/96 - ACT TWO      28.27   CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(to all)			You mean, we never told you why we 			came here?	From reactions, it's clear they haven't.					BASHIR			We're conducting the Rite of 			Separation. 					LEETA			It's an old Bajoran custom. When 			a couple separates, they spend 			several days celebrating their 			parting. It's a way to remember 			all the good times, and to seek 			out new... opportunities.					BASHIR				(grins)			It's a wise and ancient culture.					LEETA				(to Bashir)			You know, Julian, I don't think 			I've completely gotten you out of 			my system yet.					BASHIR			I know exactly what you mean.				(to all)			Excuse us. We have a few 			little... details to work out.	Leeta and Bashir EXIT. Worf still looks disturbed.					WORF			Terminating a relationship should 			not be treated so... frivolously.					DAX			Not every relationship has to end 			like a Klingon opera.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Let He...

They're 	sentiments that Worf shares.					FULLERTON			Just something to think about 			while you wait for your desserts.	With that the Essentialists disperse and Dax makes a 	beeline for Fullerton. Worf follows her.					DAX			As a Starfleet Officer, I have the 			authority to arrest you for what 			you just did.					FULLERTON			But that would be a waste of time. 			We both know the Risians won't 			prosecute.
