Rokassa juice soothes my 			nerves.  I had a very demanding 			customer today.  A Bajoran engineer 			who comes into the shop constantly, 			just to plague me...					BASHIR			I've always wondered about that... 			about who your steady customers are... 			I can't imagine Bajorans frequenting 			a shop run by a Cardassian...					GARAK			I like to think my expertise and 			willingness to serve overcome any 			general resentment my clientele may 			have.         DEEP SPACE: "Cardassians" - REV. 08/25/93 - TEASER          2.1    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Ahhh.  Perhaps your expertise and 			willingness to serve go so far as to 			establish a certain... trust... 			between you and your customers...					GARAK			Trust is very important...					BASHIR			And once they trust you, they're 			much more open with you... they... 			tell you things...					GARAK				(beat; smiling)			Really, Doctor... must we play this 			game so often?  I'm no more a "spy" 			than you are a... a...					BASHIR			...Doctor.					GARAK			I'm afraid you really do let your 			imagination run away with you.  What 			else can I say to convince you that 			I'm just --					BASHIR				(finishing Garak's 				sentence)			-- plain and simple Garak?					GARAK				(smiles)			Precisely.	A beat as the two hold each other's gaze.  Bashir mentally 	debates his next move, as if this were (and indeed is) some 	ongoing chess match.  Garak observes something in the b.g. 	behind Bashir...					GARAK			Now, there's something you don't see 			every day...         DEEP SPACE: "Cardassians" - REV. 08/25/93 - TEASER          3.2    INT. PROMENADE - AIRLOCK - GARAK'S POV	Passengers -- mostly Bajoran -- emerge from the airlock into 	the Promenade.  A sturdy, middle-aged Bajoran male, PROKA, 	has just come out of the airlock with a straight-faced twelve-	year-old Cardassian boy, RUGAL.  They are approached by a 	friendly and accommodating Zolan.  Cordial greetings are 	exchanged (this is not the first time they have met), then 	Zolan motions toward the Replimat.  All three begin to 	casually walk toward us...	Zolan smiles at the boy.  Rugal does not smile back.  Zolan's 	unfazed at the boy's stoic, almost sullen response... as 	they enter the area...					ZOLAN			There's a table.  Please, sit down 			and I'll get all of us some 			refreshment.	A little nervous with anticipation -- this job offer is a 	big deal for him -- Proka moves to sit at the unoccupied 	table.  Rugal stops, however, when he sees Garak across the 	way.  He stiffens... a look of... what?  fear?... filtering 	into his stoic expression...3thru   OMITTED67    ON BASHIR AND GARAK	Garak watches the boy curiously.  Bashir turns to watch Garak, 	wondering about the boy's reaction to him...8    RESUME RUGAL	He abruptly turns away, moves to sit down with his family.         DEEP SPACE: "Cardassians" - REV. 08/17/93 - TEASER          4.9    BASHIR AND GARAK					BASHIR			That was odd... do you know him?					GARAK			On the contrary... I've never set 			eyes on him before.            DEEP SPACE: "Cardassians" - 08/16/93 - TEASER            5.9    CONTINUED:	A beat, then Garak gets up and starts walking toward Rugal.10   PROKA AND RUGAL	seated at their table.  Rugal's back is to Garak as Garak 	approaches.  Bashir is still seated in the b.g., watching.					GARAK			I hope I'm not intruding, but I 			couldn't help noticing...11   CLOSE - RUGAL	as he looks up, sees Garak, eyes widening in fear...12   RESUME SCENE	with Garak politely, graciously addressing Proka.					GARAK				(continuing)			... what a handsome young man you 			have here...	He lays a friendly hand on Rugal's shoulder.  This turns out 	to be a serious mistake.  Rugal suddenly grabs Garak's hand, 	yanks it forward and sinks his teeth into it...13   BASHIR	stunned... he rises from his chair and hurries toward:14   RUGAL'S TABLE - SEVERAL SHOTS	Rugal viciously bites down on Garak's hand.  Garak groans in 	pain, tries to pull away...	Zolan, approaching with a tray of drinks, comes to a halt, 	surprised...	Bashir rushes up between Rugal and Garak.					BASHIR				(sharply, to Rugal)			Stop it -- stop it!         DEEP SPACE: "Cardassians" - REV. 08/17/93 - TEASER          6.14   CONTINUED:	Rugal lets go.  Garak falls back, holding his slightly 	bleeding hand, Bashir bracing him.  Rugal scurries to Proka -- 	the boy is terribly frightened -- Proka hugs him protectively.  	He stares coldly up at Garak.15   FAVORING BASHIR	as he looks at Garak's wound, then at Rugal and Proka.  He's 	amazed and confused by what has just happened.

Then why would this boy assault 			poor Garak?  An amiable fellow, if 			there ever was one...					SISKO			If you'd like, I'll try to find out.					GUL DUKAT			That would be most appreciated.  I 			need to know more about this boy, 			Commander... so I can use his story 			as ammunition in my fight to bring 			these orphans back to their 			homeland...				(sincerely)			This is a tragedy all of us on 			Cardassia must address...	Sisko acknowledges as Dukat's transmission ends... he 	contemplates Dukat's professed commitment a beat, then CUT 	TO:         DEEP SPACE: "Cardassians" - REV. 08/17/93 - ACT ONE        10.18   INT.

Widen to show an active crowd at 	the dabo table, including Zolan, the alien who met Proka and 	Rugal at the airlock.  Zolan's hot -- he's been winning -- 	and the other players are excited for him.
