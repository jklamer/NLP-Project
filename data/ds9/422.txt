COMMANDER'S OFFICE	SISKO, his displeasure and frustration controlled beneath 	his quiet courtesy, sits facing MINISTER JARO -- the gifted 	politician, practiced at being ever-affable.					JARO			Frankly, Commander, I'm surprised at 			your reaction.					SISKO				(measuring him)			Oh, I don't think much surprises 			you, Minister...					JARO			But I expected you to be celebrating!  			I was under the impression that Major 			Kira has been nothing but trouble to 			you since...					SISKO				(interrupting, 				investigative)			Who gave you that impression?					JARO			It's... common knowledge.					SISKO			Major Kira has my complete respect.  			She's been invaluable in establishing 			this command post.  And now she's 			been dismissed without anyone 			consulting me.  I don't appreciate 			it.          DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/15/93 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					JARO			Commander, Starfleet doesn't consult 			us when they wish to promote one of 			their officers...					SISKO			Are you suggesting this is a promotion 			for Kira... ?					JARO			Certainly it is.  We must find the 			proper spot for her.  After all, 			she's the one who brought Li Nalas 			back to us.	A beat... Sisko relaxes...					SISKO			Well, then that's a different matter.					JARO			I'm glad you see it.					SISKO			Yes, of course, I do.  For a minute, 			I was thinking to myself... "There's 			a warm wind blowing in from Minicoy."					JARO			I'm sorry... ?					SISKO			Just an old saying where I come from.  			It all started with a famous 			ambassador from Minicoy who used to 			bluster, exaggerate, and dissemble 			to get what he wanted... not at all 			like you or me... he was a bag of 			hot air and everyone recognized him 			for what he was.	They measure each other for a long moment... with a new 	tightness --					JARO			May I assume you are satisfied with 			the assignment of Li to fill your 			vacant post...          DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/14/93 - TEASER          3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			I thought you'd want Li to stay in 			the capital to help strengthen the 			provisional government...					JARO			Frankly, I'm not sure it's safe in 			the capital... with what's going on 			these days...					SISKO			The Circle?					JARO				(acknowledges)			The fires and graffiti were a 			nuisance.  But two days ago, one of 			my fellow ministers was attacked and 			beaten.  We can't risk that happening 			to Li Nalas.	He rises...					JARO			Look at it this way, Commander: We're 			entrusting you with Bajor's greatest 			hero.  Could you have a better liaison 			officer than Li Nalas?  I think not.	Jaro turns and leaves... Sisko at the door, watches him go...3    INCLUDING O'BRIEN	at his station.					O'BRIEN			Commander, your son's been waiting 			to speak with you on the com.	Sisko's mind is still on the departing Jaro; he moves to a 	console and hits a panel...					SISKO			Jake?					JAKE'S COM VOICE			Dad?  I'm outside our quarters.  			Could you come down for a minute?					SISKO			Is something wrong?            DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - 07/12/93 - TEASER             4.					JAKE'S COM VOICE			I really think you ought to come 			down, Dad.					SISKO			On my way.	Sisko moves very quickly to EXIT his office.4    INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SISKO'S QUARTERS	As Sisko approaches, JAKE stands awaiting him.					SISKO			What's the problem?	Jake nods toward the closed door of their quarters.

KIRA'S QUARTERS	A sadly resigned KIRA slowly packs for her departure.  The 	door CHIMES.					KIRA				(calling o.s.)			Come in.8    INCLUDING ODO	The door opens to reveal ODO.  The first thing he sees is 	her half-packed stuff, the sight of which causes him to pause 	on the threshold for a beat.  He's annoyed by what it 	portends.  Then, even as he's entering:					ODO			You're not.					KIRA			Leaving?  I really don't have much 			choice, do I...					ODO			You're not just leaving, Major.  			You're surrendering.					KIRA			You break the rules, you pay.					ODO			Wait a minute.  I want to be sure I 			heard that correctly.  Because it 			doesn't sound like the Kira Nerys 			who has made a career out of breaking 			rules...					KIRA			Well, I guess I broke one too many...         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/14/93 - ACT ONE          6.8    CONTINUED:					ODO			Major, you broke one too many fourteen 			and a half years ago... Cardassian 			rules, Bajoran rules, Federation 			rules... they're all meaningless to 			you... because you have a personal 			code that's always mattered more... 			and I'm sorry to say you're in slim 			company...					KIRA				(beat, softer)			I'll miss you too, Odo.					ODO			Have you asked Sisko for help?					KIRA			I'm sure he'll do whatever he thinks 			is best for the station...					ODO			You haven't even gone to him?					KIRA			What do you want me to do, Odo?...					ODO			Fight for what you want.  It's what 			you do best.					KIRA				(beat, without the 				least bit of 				conviction)			Maybe I just want a vacation.	Odo snorts that away...					ODO			Idiotic bureaucracy.  Now, I suppose 			they expect me to break in a new 			man...					KIRA			A great man.  Li Nalas can handle 			the job, believe me.					ODO			You did fairly well at it... once I 			smoothed your rough edges.				(off her smile)			What's so funny?         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/15/93 - ACT ONE          7.8    CONTINUED:  (2) 					KIRA			I thought you did fairly well... 			once I smoothed your edges.	The door CHIMES again.					KIRA				(calls o.s.)			Yes?...9    INCLUDING DAX	as -- carrying a small, slightly feminine (in design) spray 	bottle -- DAX ENTERS.					DAX				(re: Odo)			Am I disturbing anything?					KIRA				(to Dax)			Stick around; you can help me cry in 			my synthale.					DAX				(proffers bottle)			I thought I'd better return this 			epidellic lotion.					KIRA			No, if you like it...					DAX			... Oh, it's wonderful...					KIRA			... Then, keep it.					ODO				(exasperated)			How can you be chatting about skin 			lotion at a time like this?					DAX				(to Kira)			D'you know where you'll be stationed?	The door CHIMES.         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/14/93 - ACT ONE         7A.9    CONTINUED:					KIRA				(calls o.s.)			Come in.				(to Dax)			Not yet.  They say that after I've 			taken some leave time, I've earned a 			desk in the foreign affairs building 			somewhere.         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/14/93 - ACT ONE          8.10   INCLUDING BASHIR	as, surprised to see others present, he nonetheless ENTERS.					KIRA				(smile)			Doctor.					DAX				(to Kira)			Foreign affairs building?					BASHIR				(to Kira)			I wanted to wish you my best.					DAX				(to Kira)			Well that's certainly dull.					BASHIR				(does she mean him?)			I beg your pardon?					KIRA				(to Dax, resigned)			"Dull" is the polite word for it.					ODO				(to Bashir)			Doctor, if you were Kira, wouldn't 			you at least be complaining to 			Commander Sisko?					BASHIR				(lost)			Uh... Look, I just came to wish you 			good luck.					KIRA				(to Bashir; gently)			Thank you, Doctor.					BASHIR				(to Odo)			"Complaining" about what?					ODO				(to Bashir)			Nevermind, Doctor; if she doesn't 			care, why should we?					BASHIR				(to Kira)			Have they given you any explanation 			yet?         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/14/93 - ACT ONE          9.10   CONTINUED:					DAX				(to Kira)			Did they offer any alternative?					KIRA				(to Odo)			I do care.				(to Bashir)			No, they haven't.				(to Dax)			No, they didn't.				(to all)			Look, I really ought to finish 			packing...	The door CHIMES.					BASHIR				(to Odo)			You said "If she doesn't care"... 			You mean about leaving...					KIRA				(calls o.s.)			By all means, come on in.					ODO				(to Dax)			She's done well here... she ought to 			stay here...				(challenging him)			And I'd say she needs a little support 			from her friends, Doctor.					BASHIR			Well, yes, certainly, but if her 			orders...	Stops mid-sentence and turns to see --11   INCLUDING O'BRIEN	Startled to see so many others present, he stands tentatively -- 	silently -- on the threshold for a beat, with:					O'BRIEN			Uh...					KIRA				(genuine smile)			Chief.  Come in.         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/15/93 - ACT ONE         10.11   CONTINUED:	Kira moves to O'Brien; takes his arm, and literally 	"escorts" him in, with:					O'BRIEN			I didn't mean to intrude.  I just, 			uh...					BASHIR			Don't worry, Chief; it's all been 			said.					ODO			I have a good deal more to say, thank 			you, Doctor.					O'BRIEN				(off Odo's demeanor)			Look, I could come back... I do have 			a couple of graviton generators being 			overhauled...					DAX			Leave her alone, Odo, this is Kira's 			decision to make.				(to Kira)			Unless you want me to talk to 			Benjamin.					KIRA			I knew what I was doing; I knew the 			risk.					ODO			That's not what she asked you.					O'BRIEN				(wants out)			I just wanted to say, Major, it's 			been a pleasure serving with you.					BASHIR			Will somebody please explain this 			conversation to me?	O'Brien has started inching toward the door; but... The door 	CHIMES.         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/14/93 - ACT ONE         11.11   CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA				(calls o.s.; wearily)			Come in.12   INCLUDING QUARK	who unabashedly ENTERS carrying a very small flagon of 	synthale.					QUARK			A party?				(to Kira)			For you, I would've reduced my 			catering rates.					ODO			It's not a party.				(re: flagon)			What's that?					KIRA				(gratefully)			A bottle of my favorite synthale, I 			think.  That's very thoughtful, Quark.					ODO			It's also very small.					QUARK				(to Odo)			I was anticipating a far smaller 			gathering.  I thought, perhaps, an 			intimate farewell drink, a sympathetic 			smile, a shoulder to cry on...					O'BRIEN				(eyeing door)			Again, Major... It's really been...					QUARK				(continuing to Odo)			... you'd be surprised how often that 			works with women...	Again O'Brien's backing to the door.  Again, however, the 	door CHIMES.

Come on 			in.  Join the crowd.13   INCLUDING BAREIL	In the doorway stands VEDEK BAREIL (the Bajoran Vedek we 	first met in our "IN THE HANDS OF THE PROPHETS" episode).  	As he's revealed, there's sudden, complete SILENCE in the 	room... And Kira BOLTS to her feet.					KIRA			Vedek Bareil.					BAREIL			I didn't mean to intrude...					KIRA			No; please... Come in.

Mister O'Brien, I believe.					O'BRIEN			How do you do, Sir.					KIRA			I had no idea you were coming to the 			station.					BAREIL			Nowadays, it's probably wiser not to 			announce those things.         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/15/93 - ACT ONE         13.13   CONTINUED:					ODO			How bad is it on Bajor, Vedek?					BAREIL			The violence has seriously 			escalated... it almost seems there 			are more weapons on the streets now 			than during the occupation...					KIRA			How is that possible?  Where would 			they be coming from?	Bareil shakes his head, doesn't know.					BAREIL			I try to concentrate on more spiritual 			matters.					KIRA			Yes, of course, I mean, I didn't 			mean to suggest that you would 			actually know where...					BAREIL				(rescuing her)			I understand your duties here are 			finished.					KIRA			Yes, it is.					BAREIL			Do you have any immediate plans?					KIRA			I... haven't had much time... to 			give it any thought...					BAREIL			Then, I have the perfect solution... 			Come and stay at our monastery for a 			while.  It can help when the spirit 			gets a little bruised.	Kira, taken (pleasantly) aback by the offer, can only look 	at him for a beat.14   CLOSE - KIRA	Taken with the ethereal quality of the man.         DEEP SPACE: "The Circle" - REV. 07/14/93 - ACT ONE         14.14   CONTINUED:					KIRA				(beat; softly)			Thank you.15   INT.
