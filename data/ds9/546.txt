QUARK'S	A typical busy day. ODO ENTERS and heads over to the 	bar, where QUARK is struggling to keep up with a long 	list of orders. He's pouring several drinks at the 	same time while two N.D. Waiters impatiently stand 	nearby with empty serving trays.					ODO			Having a bad day?					QUARK 			Like you care.	He quickly hands the drinks onto one waiter's tray.					QUARK				(re: each drink) 			Fizz... Froth... Flip... Finial... 			Foam... and Flare.				(to Waiter) 			What's going on at that table, 			anyway?	The Waiter shrugs and then moves off to deliver the 	drinks. Quark grabs a PADD from a waiter. He sets up 	two more glasses, and quickly begins mixing drinks.					ODO			I take it there's a problem with			your drink replicator.	In the b.g., DAX ENTERS, carrying a toolkit, and heads 	for the bar.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/19/98 - TEASER          2.1    CONTINUED:					QUARK 				(building) 			Problem? No. Can't be. If there 			was a problem, I'd have submitted 			an emergency maintenance request 			this morning. And if I'd done 			that, Chief O'Brien would've 			assured me that Rom would fix it 			right away. And of course, Rom 			would've then promised me that Nog 			would fix it before the end of the 			day. And since this is the end 			of the day and there's no Nog in 			sight, we can only draw one 			conclusion -- that I don't have 			a problem!					DAX 			Is your drink replicator broken?	Quark shoots her a look.					QUARK			Oh, you're quick today.					DAX			Well, do you want me to fix it or 			not?	Quark looks up in surprise.					QUARK			You?					DAX			That's right. Nog had a chance 			to take a trip to Ferenginar and 			I told him I'd cover for him while 			he was away.					QUARK				(appalled) 			Why?					DAX			Because he did me a favor last 			week and I owe him one.	She moves around the bar and heads for the replicator.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/19/98 - TEASER          3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					QUARK 			But this is work for a... a 			mechanic. A repairman. A lowly 			engineer.					DAX			I'm going to tell Chief O'Brien 			you said that.	She opens a panel below the replicator and begins 	poking around in the circuitry inside. Quark is 	horrified. He reads from PADD.					QUARK				(reading) 			A super nova and a silven surprise.				(to Odo)			She can't do this.					ODO			Why not?					QUARK 			It's... it's not right. She's 			above this sort of thing. Those 			hands weren't meant to be poking 			around inside a filthy drink 			replicator. They were meant 			for... higher pursuits.	Odo suddenly realizes that he's found a point of 	weakness and he leans over the bar with delight.					ODO			You're in love.	Quark stiffens at the suggestion.					QUARK 			That is the most ridiculous thing 			you've said in the last year.					ODO			Really?					QUARK 			Really.				(harsh, to Dax) 			Well, if you're going to fix it, 			fix it.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/19/98 - TEASER         3A.1    CONTINUED: (3)					QUARK (Cont'd) 			I've got a business to run here, 			I don't have all day to wait 			around for you to figure out basic 			engineering.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/19/98 - TEASER          4.1    CONTINUED:	(4)					DAX				(unfazed) 			Keep that up and I'll stick your 			head in here.	Dax keeps working and Quark goes back to making his 	drinks.					ODO				(enjoying it) 			It must kill you that she's 			married to Worf.	Quark puts the two drinks. on a tray.					QUARK 			I don't know what you're talking 			about and if you're not going to 			order something, would you please 			step aside so I can do my job.					ODO 			Of course.				(re: one of the drinks) 			Oh, and by the way -- that's not 			a silven surprise, it's a silken 			sunrise.	Quark looks at the drink and checks the order -- Odo's	right. Odo EXITS in triumph while Quark tosses out the	drink and glares after him.									CUT TO:2    EXT.

It's 			for his eyes only.					JAKE 			But you know what's in it?					NOG 			Maybe...					JAKE 			It's a proposal for an alliance, 			isn't it? I mean, the Federation 			sends the one Ferengi in Starfleet 			to personally deliver a diplomatic 			message to the Grand Nagus. 			Something big is up.					NOG 			You told me you weren't coming on 			this trip as a reporter.					JAKE 			I'm not.

I just sort 			of... okay, I promised. But this 			could be a really big story, Nog. 			The people have a right to know!					NOG 			Forget it. You're not getting 			anywhere near the Nagus and I have 			no further comments.	Jake sits back in his chair, frustrated but not yet 	defeated.

She's 	about 18 years old and wears a Chief Petty Officer's 	insignia on one collar (identical to that worn by 	O'Brien) and a special BADGE on the other collar that 	we'll eventually learn is the symbol for Red Squadron. 	Collins is petite and looks, if anything, younger than 	her age. She's a Starfleet cadet, and that means she's 	polite, correct, and takes her job very, very seriously.	It takes Jake a second to realize that she's talking 	to him.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/19/98 - ACT ONE       12A.18   CONTINUED:					JAKE 			Yes.

All stations 			submit damage and casualty reports 			to the first officer.	As the Bridge crew, continues to work, Watters finally 	notices their visitors. He gets out of his chair and 	goes over to greet them. Watters is about 22 years 	old, tall but lanky.	Watters is under tremendous pressure as the captain of 	this ship. He sleeps too little, drinks too much 	coffee and (as we'll learn) is secretly taking 	medication to keep himself going. Watters can't allow 	himself to unbend even for a moment, lest he come 	unglued. He drives his crew hard, expects nothing but 	the best from them. For their part, the crew both hate 	and love him. He may push them to their limits, but 	he's kept them alive for eight long months and by now 	they'll do almost anything for him.					WATTERS				(brusque) 			Glad to see you made it in one 			piece. I'm Tim Watters, 			Commanding Officer. Welcome 			aboard.	He and Nog shake hands.					NOG 			Thank you... sir?					WATTERS				(tolerant) 			"Sir" is correct, ensign.

VALIANT - READY ROOM	Nog is sitting in a chair in front of the captain's 	desk. Watters is relating the same backstory to him.					WATTERS 			We were transiting the Kepla 			Sector when the war broke out. 			As you probably know, a Dominion 			invasion force swept through that 			sector on the first day.					NOG 			So you were caught behind enemy 			lines?					WATTERS 			Correct. We were trying to make 			our way back to Federation-held 			space when we encountered a 			Cardassian battle cruiser near 			El-Gatark. It was our first taste 			of combat.				(beat) 			In the first fifteen minutes, four 			regular officers were killed and 			three others were critically 			wounded... including Captain 			Ramirez.					NOG 			Is that when you took command?					WATTERS 			No. When I got to the bridge, the 			captain was in pretty bad shape 			but he was lucid and refused to 			go to Sickbay. We'd lost main 			power and were adrift, but the 			Cardassian cruiser was no better 			off. So it was a race against the 			clock -- the ship that got main 			power back on-line first would 			have a decisive advantage.				(beat) 			The captain was... amazing. He 			directed the entire damage control 			effort with a punctured lung and 			massive internal injuries.				(quiet)			He was a great man.         DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/19/98 - ACT ONE        20.26   CONTINUED:	There's a silent, somber beat.					NOG 			And he won the race.					WATTERS 			We got weapons and impulse engines 			back on-line within three hours. 			And we destroyed that Cardie ship. 				(beat) 			The next day, just before he died, 			the captain ordered me to take 			command of the Valiant.	Nog is impressed and it shows.					NOG 			It's... unbelievable. You've 			spent eight months behind enemy 			lines.					WATTERS 			I didn't do it alone. The crew 			deserves the real credit. We have 			cadets here as young as seventeen 			who're doing the jobs of officers 			twice their age.	Watters moves around the desk and sits on the edge of 	it, turning his attention away from the past and 	focusing it on Nog. And when you're the focus of 	Watters's attention, it is at once unsettling and 	exhilarating.					WATTERS 			But we're also seriously 			undermanned. I could use another 			officer.					NOG 			I'd be happy to do whatever I can, 			sir.					WATTERS 			I see you're familiar with the 			operations of a class-seven warp 			drive.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/1.9/98 - ACT ONE       20A.26   CONTINUED:	(2)					NOG 				(proud) 			Very familiar, sir.

"mission?"					WATTERS			My orders are to collect technical			data on a new Dominion battleship			operating in this sector. We keep			picking up their com traffic, so			we know they're still in the area,			but since we can't go faster than			warp three point two, we're unable			to get within sensor range.					NOG				(surprised) 			And Starfleet knows that you're 			in command of the Valiant?					WATTERS 			No. We've had to maintain strict 			radio silence ever since the war 			began.

Jake is wearing different clothes and looks 	rested from his ordeal.					SISKO 			We've scanned the area for any 			other escape pods, but it doesn't 			look like anyone else made it.	Jake nods.					JAKE 			It was a long shot. I just 			thought that maybe...	They EXIT to...90   INT. DEFIANT - SICKBAY	Collins is sleeping in a bio-bed, her head wound now 	healed. Nog is sitting on another bed, watching 	Collins sleep. BASHIR is working at a computer 	console, as Sisko and Jake ENTER.					SISKO				(quiet) 			How is she, doctor?					BASHIR 			I've repaired her skull fracture 			and with a little rest she should 			make a full recovery.					SISKO			And Nog?        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/19/598 - ACT FIVE       61.90   CONTINUED:					BASHIR 			A few bumps and bruises, but 			otherwise he's fine.					JAKE 			Can I talk to him?					BASHIR 			I don't see why not.	Jake heads over to Nog. Sisko motions to Bashir for 	the two of them to leave and give Jake and Nog some 	privacy. Sisko and Bashir EXIT.	Jake sits on the bed next to Nog, who's removed the Red 	Squad insignia from his collar and is toying with it. 	There's a quiet beat.					JAKE 			You okay?					NOG 			Yeah.	Beat.					NOG 			You going to write a story about 			all this?					JAKE 			Probably.					NOG 			What are you going to say?					JAKE 			What do you think I should say?	Beat.					NOG 			That it was a good ship... with 			a good crew... that made a 			mistake. We... let ourselves 			blindly follow Captain Watters... 			and he led us over a cliff.					COLLINS'S VOICE 			That's not true.        DEEP SPACE NINE: "Valiant" - REV. 3/19/98 - ACT FIVE        62. 90   CONTINUED:	(2)	They look up to see that Collins is now awake.					COLLINS 			Captain Watters was a great man.					JAKE 			Dorian, he got everyone killed.	But Collins won't hear of it. Her devotion to her dead 	Captain's memory is based more on loyalty and love than 	logic.					COLLINS				(fierce) 			If he failed... it's because we			failed him.	There's a quiet beat before Nog gets off the bio-bed.					NOG 			Put that in the story too. Let 			people read it... and decide for 			themselves.	Nog goes over to Collins and takes her hand for a 	moment. She's angry, defensive, on the verge of tears.					NOG				(to Collins) 			He may have been a hero... he may 			even have been a great man... but 			in the end, he was a bad captain.	Nog lets her hand go and walks away. She looks down 	at her hand...90A  CLOSE ON COLLINS'S HAND	Which has Nog's Red Squad insignia pin in it.
