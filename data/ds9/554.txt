CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	SISKO is sitting at his desk, working on a PADD.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Kira to Sisko.					SISKO			Go ahead, colonel.					KIRA'S COM VOICE			Captain Solok of the Starship			T'Kumbra is here to see you.	Sisko's entire body seems to tense and his jaw 	clenches automatically. It's an effort to put the 	PADD down and keep his voice even.					SISKO 			Send him in.	He gets up and braces himself for a beat. CAPTAIN 	SOLOK ENTERS, carrying a PADD. Solok is Vulcan and 	looks to be about Sisko's age. For someone skilled 	in the Vulcan disciplines of emotional suppression 	and control he manages to convey both superiority 	and arrogance without saying a word. For his part, 	the muscles in Sisko's jaw are working overtime even 	as he forces a smile on his face. They do not shake 	hands.					SISKO			Welcome to Deep Space Nine,			captain.					SOLOK			Your welcome is acknowledged.	Beat.					SISKO			Have a seat.	They sit.					SISKO			Been a long time.					SOLOK			Ten years, two months, five days.					SISKO			You mean you don't know it to the			minute?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out... " - REV. 08/20/98 - TEASER     2A.3    CONTINUED:					SOLOK 			Of course I do. But humans are 			often irked by such precision. 				(beat) 			Especially the more emotional 			humans.	For some reason, Solok seems to delight in pushing 	Sisko's buttons and Sisko has to struggle to keep 	from reacting -- he won't give the Vulcan the 	satisfaction if he can help it. Solok hands him the 	PADD.					SOLOK 				(re: PADD) 			Our repair list.	Sisko looks it over.					SOLOK 			I understand that you were 			recently honored with the 			Christopher Pike Medal for Valor. 			Congratulations.					SISKO			Thank you.				(grudging) 			And congratulations to you. I 			heard you received the Medal last 			month.					SOLOK 			My second, actually. The 			T'Kumbra has been in combat for 			over six months. Spending time 			behind the lines will be a 			welcome change.	Sisko looks up sharply.					SISKO 			This isn't exactly a safe harbor. 			We've seen our share of action.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out... " - REV. 08/20/98 - TEASER      3.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					SOLOK			Of course you have.	Sisko clenches his jaw and goes back to the PADD.					SISKO			We can upgrade your ship's 			inertial dampers by the end of 			the day. But we can't begin to 			overhaul your warp core for at 			least a week.					SOLOK			That is most inefficient.					SISKO			War's an inefficient business.					SOLOK			A somewhat unprofessional 			attitude. However, I have come 			to expect a lack of 			professionalism and efficiency on 			starbases run by human officers.					SISKO			You're welcome to take your ship 			to a Vulcan station -- I think 			the nearest one's about fifty 			light years away.				(hands back the				PADD)			If you plan on staying with us			here "behind the lines," my chief			of operations will see to your			requests.					SOLOK			Very well. There is another 			matter not listed on the formal 			report.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out... " - REV. 08/20/98 - TEASER    4-5.3    CONTINUED:	(3)					SOLOK (Cont'd)				(off his look)			I need use of a holosuite. The			T'Kumbra holodecks are currently			under repair.					SISKO			You'll have to arrange holosuite			time through Quark -- he owns the			only ones on the station.					SOLOK			Then I will speak to Quark. I			created a special program for my			senior staff and they are quite			eager to resume using it.					SISKO				(couldn't care less)			Really?					SOLOK			Yes. In fact, you might find the			program to be of some interest.				(beat)			It's based on an Earth game.					SISKO				(whatever)			What game would that be?	Solok has been waiting for just that question. He 	raises an eyebrow and comes as close as he can to 	actually smiling in anticipation.									CUT TO:4    INT. OPS	A few minutes later. KIRA is still on duty when 	Solok ENTERS from the captain's office, a somewhat 	smug look on his face. Sisko comes out behind him, 	a stern, determined expression on his features. 	Solok EXITS and Kira looks at Sisko.					SISKO 			Colonel. Assemble the senior 			staff in the wardroom. Now.									CUT TO:     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out... " - REV. 08/20/98 - TEASER      6.5    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Re-establishing the station.6    INT. WARDROOM	A short time later. Kira, NOG, WORF, BASHIR, 	O'BRIEN and EZRI are all gathered around the table. 	Sisko ENTERS carrying a large box. There's a 	thundercloud on his brow, and everyone waits to see 	what crisis has befallen them.					SISKO 			As you probably know, the 			Starship T'Kumbra is currently 			docked at the station. What you 			may not know is that their 			commanding officer considers his 			crew -- an all-Vulcan crew, by 			the way -- to be the finest in 			the fleet. Now, I happen to 			think the people sitting around 			this table comprise the finest 			crew in the quadrant.	A few looks go around the table.					EZRI 				(wry) 			You're not going to get much of 			an argument from this group.					SISKO			I didn't think so. So when the 			T'Kumbra's captain challenged us 			to a contest of courage, 			teamwork and sacrifice, I 			accepted on your behalf.					WORF			We will destroy them.					SISKO			Exactly the reaction I was hoping 			for.					BASHIR 			So when is this clash of the 			titans?					SISKO			Two weeks from today, in 			Holosuite Five.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out...

OPS	Worf, Nog and Kira on duty. Each of them has a 	PADD in their hands, which they're reading intently. 	The Ops table has an OKUDAGRAM of a baseball diamond 	on it.					KIRA				(reading) 			"The infield fly rule is invoked 			in instances where, with both 			first base and second base 			occupied, or with first, second 			and third base occupied... "					WORF			What if there's a runner at home?					NOG 			There's never a runner at home.					KIRA			Okay. "... and fewer than two 			outs, and the batter hits a high 			fly... "	They all look up "fly." Worf finds it first.					WORF 			"Fly: the term for a batted ball 			while it is in the air."					KIRA				(remembering) 			Right. Uh, "... fewer than two 			out, the batter hits a high fly 			which in the judgment of the 			umpire can readily be caught by 			an infielder or the pitcher or 			catcher inside fair ground. The 			batter is then called out 			regardless of whether the ball is 			subsequently caught or not."					NOG			That seems simple enough.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out...

QUARK'S	Where Ezri, Bashir and O'Brien are sitting at a 	table. A PADD is sitting on the table and Ezri is 	quizzing the other two.					BASHIR				(confident, from				memory) 			A bunt is a ball which has been 			deliberately tapped into the area 			between the pitcher and the 			catcher in an attempt to force 			the fielding team to throw out 			the batter and allow a runner to 			advance.					EZRI 			Right. Chief, what's a grand 			slam?					O'BRIEN			Uh... a home run hit with the 			bases crowded.					EZRI 			Right -- but it's "bases loaded." 			Now... what's a Fancy Dan?					O'BRIEN			A what?					BASHIR 			You made that up.					EZRI 			I most certainly did not.	Bashir and O'Brien trade looks, then Bashir picks up 	the PADD with a skeptical look and O'Brien looks 	over his shoulder. ROM and LEETA come by the table.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out... " - REV. 08/20/98 - ACT ONE     9.8    CONTINUED:					LEETA 			Jake told us about the game 			against the Vulcans. It sounds 			very exciting.					EZRI			You should come watch.					BASHIR 				(reading)			"Fancy Dan -- a fielder who puts 			an extra flourish on his movements 			while making a play in hopes of 			gaining the approval of the 			spectators."	Ezri smiles smugly. In the b.g. QUARK delivers some 	drinks to a nearby table.					LEETA 			Actually... we were thinking of 			doing more than watching...					ROM 			If we can. That is... if there's 			still room for... other... 			potential... players to... 			possibly... try and...					LEETA 			We'd like to try out.	They all look up in surprise. Quark has overheard 	this and can't believe it.					ROM 			Nog always talks about how 			Captain Sisko and Jake play 			baseball and how it brings them 			closer together. Since Nog and I 			haven't seen much of each other 			lately, I thought... this might 			be a good way of spending some 			time together.					LEETA 			And I decided to make it a 			complete family outing.					EZRI 			That's so sweet.					LEETA 			Isn't it?	Quark steps in.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out...

The would-be members of Sisko's 	team are milling about on the in-field -- Kira, 	Worf, Bashir, Nog, Quark, Ezri, Rom, Leeta and 	O'Brien. They all have gloves, and the Starfleet 	officers are hanging their uniform jackets on the 	fence.	Sisko and JAKE walk onto the field, each of them 	wearing caps (with twentieth century Major League 	logos), and carrying gloves. The would-be team 	gathers around Sisko, who's in full coach mode.					SISKO 			First day of practice! It's an 			exciting time! Am I right?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out... " - REV. 08/20/98 - ACT ONE    12.10   CONTINUED:	He's greeted with a few wan smiles and some 	tentative "Rights" and "Can't waits" from his crew.					SISKO 			There we go, there we go! That's 			the spirit! All right!				(beat) 			Now, let me introduce you to our 			pitcher and secret weapon -- Jake 			"Slider" Sisko.	Jake bounces a ball off his inside elbow and tugs at 	his cap.					JAKE 			Howdy.					SISKO			Every other position is open for tryouts.				(beat) 			Everyone here today has watched 			at least one baseball game with 			me in a holosuite... and I know 			that it looks simple -- you throw 			the ball, you catch the ball, you 			hit the ball. But it's not that 			easy. It was a difficult game to 			play for seasoned professionals 			who'd spent a lifetime 			practicing. We have less than 			two weeks to build a team and 			take the field against our 			opponents.				(beat) 			Now, some of you may be thinking, 			"How can we beat the Logicians, 			they're all Vulcans! They're 			stronger and faster than any one 			of us -- except for Worf." But 			baseball is about more than 			physical strength. It's also 			about courage... faith... and 			most of all, heart. And if 			there's one thing our Vulcan 			friend lacks -- it's heart.				(beat) 			I think we can beat them. I know 			we can beat them. And we are 			going to beat them. Am I right?	They nod silently.					SISKO 			I can't hear you.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out...

Throw and catch, throw and 			catch... nice and easy.	Jake passes out some baseballs from a nearby bag and 	they pair off.11   VARIOUS ANGLES	As the team tries to play catch. It's not a pretty 	sight. Just catching the ball with the unfamiliar 	gloves turns out to be much harder than any of them 	anticipated. In only a few seconds, they're chasing 	dropped balls all over the diamond, some people are 	getting hit and some balls are sailing way over 	their heads.12   JAKE & SISKO	Jake is watching with growing dismay as their "team" 	warms up. Sisko, on the other hand, is watching 	with growing determination to win at any cost.					JAKE 			These are going to be two long, 			hard weeks.					SISKO			Jake, I don't care how long and 			hard the next two weeks are, I am 			not going to lose a baseball game 			to Solok.				(beat) 			We' re going to win.	Sisko says this with such forceful determination, 	that Jake is taken by surprise.

My 			third host -- Emony -- was an 			Olympic gymnast.	Ezri gets to her feet and gingerly tests the knee.					EZRI 			I kept expecting my legs to react 			like hers did, but I fell all 			over myself. It's like I don't 			know my own body anymore.	Kira ENTERS from Surgery, flexing her wrist and 	fingers.					QUARK			I don't know what you're 			complaining about. At least you 			didn't require major surgery.					KIRA			Knitting a couple of bones 			together isn't major surgery, 			Quark.					QUARK 			It is if the bones are in the 			back of your skull.				(to Rom) 			I hope you've learned your 			lesson.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out...

Vulcan #2 is at bat and hits 	a ball deep into right, along the baseline.101  VULCAN #1	is heading for third.

Vulcan #1 turns around, finds Nog on 	the plate, and elects to go into the dugout.	Odo has seen the whole thing and doesn't put his 	mask back on and stays away from the batter's box. 	Nog suddenly realizes that something's up.					NOG			What's wrong?106  O'BRIEN	looks puzzled as well. He glances up at the 	scoreboard, which still reads Logicians 10, Niners 	0. (Top of the 9th. Logicians 14 hits, 0 errors. 	Niners 5 hits, 4 errors. Two outs.)

Nog keeps a wary eye on Vulcan #2, 	who's holed up on third, but Nog could easily throw 	him out if he made a move toward home. Nog reaches 	the dugout, but hesitates when he looks inside:107  IN THE DUGOUT	where all the Logicians are sitting on the bench, 	looking very, very much alike.					NOG 				(to Odo) 			Which one?	Odo averts his eyes.					KASIDY 			Tag 'em all!	Nog climbs down into the dugout and touches the 	first Vulcan with the ball.

Hurry up!	But Jake is starting to laugh -- the absurdity of it 	all getting the better of him.109  SISKO	is smiling up in the stands, starting to laugh. Rom 	is grinning broadly too.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out... " - REV. 08/20/98 - ACT FIVE    54.110  NOG	is almost to the end of the bench.

Jake stands up, holds 	the ball high over his head and takes a bow.112  SISKO	up in the stands, finds himself laughing too. He 	looks over at Rom.					SISKO 			Did you see that? 	Rom nods.					SISKO			That's what I love about this 			game -- every situation is 			different, you never know what's 			going to happen next.					ROM				(brave smile) 			It... it looks like a lot of fun.	Sisko suddenly realizes that he's treated the 	Ferengi way too harshly. Sisko gets up and goes 	over to Rom as the Niners get ready to take their 	turn at bat. He looks down at Rom for a moment.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Take Me Out...
