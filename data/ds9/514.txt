QUARK'S	A busy day. LEETA is at the dabo wheel, QUARK is 	making drinks for MORN and a slew of customers, and ROM 	is sitting at the end of the bar eating lunch. (NOTE: 	Leeta's dialogue takes place in the b.g. while the 	scene between Rom and Quark plays out in the f.g.)					LEETA				(under following action)			Okay... that's twelve spins and 			not a single dabo so far... the 			pot's growing and someone's going 			to be a big winner... but 			remember, there's no way to win 			unless you spin... let the wheel 			do the work... come on, don't be 			shy, I don't bite -- at least not 			when I'm working. Your latinum is 			always welcome, but if you want 			credit you'll have to talk to the 			owner. Wheel's set! Here we go! 			Last call for riches! Bets 			down... oh, Karlinko! Sorry 			everyone. Merla, can you take 			over? It's time for my break.	Rom keeps looking up at the gorgeous Leeta as she spins 	the wheel and plies her trade -- he's obviously smitten 	with her, but when she glances in his direction, he 	quickly averts his eyes and concentrates on his lunch. 	Quark notes his brother's interest with a shake of his 	head -- this is nothing new to Quark.					ROM			Today's the day, brother. I'm 			really going to do it this time.					QUARK				(mixing drinks)			You've been saying that for weeks.					ROM			I've been waiting for the right 			moment. And this is it.					QUARK			Now?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir... " - REV. 1/6/97 - TEASER      2.1    CONTINUED:					ROM			It's perfect. She's about to go			on her break, and when she does, 			she'll come over here to say "hi" to			me...				(almost glowing)			... like she always does... and 			that's when I'll do it.					QUARK			What are you going to say?					ROM			I'm just going to say it.					QUARK			Okay, let's hear it.	Quark leans on the bar and looks Rom in the eyes. Rom 	suddenly becomes nervous even on this dry run.					ROM				(fumbling)			I... uh... Leeta, would you... 			like... maybe to... one night... 			soon... to... maybe...					QUARK			You're a regular poet, Rom.				ROM 			I can do better.					QUARK			Prove it.	Quark nods toward Leeta who is walking over to the bar. 	Rom tenses.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir...

Quark pauses with her food and drink to see what 	will happen. Leeta waits with an open and inviting 	expression...					ROM			Bye.	Rom flees the bar. Leeta looks after him with a 	disappointed expression. Quark puts some hesperat and 	juice down in front of her.					LEETA			I must be doing something wrong...					QUARK			I don't know, Leeta... maybe he 			just isn't interested in you.					LEETA			I know he likes me.					QUARK			Likes you, yes. But he's an 			engineer... a problem solver... 			he needs a woman with a body and 			brains.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir... " - REV. 1/6/97 - TEASER      4.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					LEETA				(annoyed)			I have brains.					QUARK			Of course you do, honey. That's 			why I hired you. Now eat up and 			then get those brains back to the 			dabo wheel where the customers can 			get a good long look at them.	Quark moves away with a smirk and Leeta glares at him 	before tucking into her food.2    FOLLOW QUARK	As he moves through the room, we DROP OFF on					BASHIR and O'BRIEN, who are playing darts. O'Brien 	has just won. Bashir goes to retrieve the darts.					BASHIR			I see you're back in the zone 			today.					O'BRIEN			I never really left it. I've just 			been giving you a chance to get even.					BASHIR			Thank you, but I don't need your 			charity. Another game?					O'BRIEN			Maybe one. I promised Molly I'd 			do some coloring with her this 			afternoon. With all this 			attention focused on the baby, I 			don't want her to start feeling 			like we've forgotten about her.	They start playing again.					BASHIR			A father's work is never done.					O'BRIEN			You said it. Oh, but it's worth 			it. Someday you should give it a 			try.					BASHIR			Me? No.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir...

CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	SISKO is listening to Zimmerman explain why he's here. 	Bashir is sitting nearby and obviously knows what's 	going on and is excited.					ZIMMERMAN				(to Sisko)			You're familiar, of course, with 			the Emergency Medical Holographic 			Program?					SISKO			I've heard of it.				(remembering)			It's a hologram designed to... 			provide assistance... during 			emergencies in Sickbay.					ZIMMERMAN			It does much more than "provide 			assistance."					BASHIR			The holographic doctor can 			literally replace a starship's 			medical officer during an 			emergency.					ZIMMERMAN			I'm surprised you don't have one 			on the station.					SISKO			The station facilities are 			Cardassian in origin. Much of our 			equipment is incompatible with 			Federation technology.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir... " - REV. 1/6/97 - ACT ONE     7.5    CONTINUED:					ZIMMERMAN			How unfortunate. For you.				(beat)			In any case, the original EMH was 			designed for short-term use only. 			But now, Starfleet has requested			a program designed to operate as			full-time doctor.					SISKO			Full time? You're not talking 			about replacing real doctors?					ZIMMERMAN			No, no. Of course not. Why is 			everyone so worried about 			holograms taking over the 			universe?	Sisko is starting to take a dislike to this guy, but 	restrains himself because Bashir is obviously so 	excited.					BASHIR			There are many situations where a 			holo-doctor could be more 			beneficial than a humanoid: 			research outposts, subspace 			communication stations, certain 			long-range exploratory vessels...					ZIMMERMAN			In short, anywhere that life-			support or living space is at a 			premium and where the primary 			mission does not require the 			doctor to leave Sickbay.					SISKO			I see.				(to Bashir)			And they want to model this new 			EMH program after you.	Bashir smiles with a mixture of pride and 	embarrassment.					ZIMMERMAN			Technically, it is a LMH. Long-			term Medical Holographic Program. 			And yes, Starfleet Medical has 			selected Doctor Bashir to provide 			the template.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir... " - REV. 1/6/97 - ACT ONE     8.5    CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			Who was the template for the EMH?					ZIMMERMAN			Me.				(a little defensive)			It was my program after all... it 			only seemed logical to use myself 			as a model.					SISKO			Of course.				(to Bashir)			This must be quite an honor.					BASHIR			It's... a bit of a feather in my 			cap, yes.					ZIMMERMAN			It is nothing less than a shot at 			immortality. The original EMH 			program will probably still be in			use for decades to come. The LMH 			will undoubtedly last even longer. 			If I can solve certain technical 			problems.				(lets get on with it)			Now, I'll need to remain here for 			at least three weeks. I'll need 			quarters, access to your main 			computer, a technician to install 			my equipment, a high-speed data 			link with my lab on--					SISKO			My first officer, Major Kira will 			see to all your needs.	He moves to Bashir and shakes his hand warmly.					SISKO				(heartfelt)			Congratulations, Doctor. I know 			I speak for everyone on the 			station when I say that we're all 			very proud of you.					BASHIR			Thank you, sir.					ZIMMERMAN			Let's go.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir...

SURGERY	O'Brien is standing on a stepladder and working to 	install a series of holographic projectors into the 	ceiling of the Infirmary. To this end, he's opened 	several panels on the ceiling and walls, and new 	equipment and devices are strewn about the normally 	immaculate room. Zimmerman ENTERS from an adjacent 	room. He is now wearing his customary lab coat and is 	wheeling in a movable console loaded with scanners, 	PADDS, and other devices. Bashir is sitting at a desk 	filling out a questionnaire on a PADD.					BASHIR			This is a long questionnaire...					ZIMMERMAN			I pride myself on my attention to 			detail.					BASHIR			"Compare and contrast your eating 			habits at age five with those at 			ages ten, fifteen, twenty, and 			twenty-five?"					ZIMMERMAN			It will be necessary for the holo			doctor to interact naturally with 			his patients for weeks, possibly 			even months. The doctor will be 			expected to share amusing 			anecdotes, extend sympathy, swap 			dirty jokes and even have 			culinary opinions formed by 			experience.					O'BRIEN			You mean this program is going to 			have all of his personal likes and 			dislikes?					ZIMMERMAN			That is why we bother to choose a			human template in the first place. DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir... " - REV. 1/6/97 - ACT ONE 10-13.    6    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(to Bashir)			Think of it, Julian. If this 			works, you could irritate hundreds 			of people you've never even met.					BASHIR				(nods seriously)			If I'm going to be truly annoying, 			I'll have to get under their skin			quickly.				(works PADD)			At age five -- I loved brussel sprouts.					O'BRIEN			That's the spirit. I hate you 			already. 					ZIMMERMAN			If you two can suspend your oh-so-			amusing banter for the moment, I'd 			like to begin the optical 			parameter scans.	Bashir and O'Brien exchange an amused look and then 	Bashir puts down the PADD and moves over to where 	Zimmerman is preparing a large, handheld scanner.					BASHIR			What should I do?					ZIMMERMAN			Just stand there and look like a 			doctor.				(under his breath)			If you can.	Zimmerman makes an adjustment to the scanner and begins 	scanning Bashir.7thru   OMITTED8     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir...

Zimmerman is looking down at Leeta in 	fascination.					ZIMMERMAN			We don't have anything like this			on Jupiter Station... or like her.					BASHIR			Beautiful, isn't she?					ZIMMERMAN			Amazing. Who is she?					BASHIR			Her name's Leeta.				(with pride)			My ex-girlfriend.	Zimmerman gives him a sharp look.					ZIMMERMAN			Who broke it off?					BASHIR			She did.					ZIMMERMAN			I like her already.	He looks down at Leeta again.11   ZIMMERMAN'S POV	Leeta's gaze happens to land on Zimmerman for just a 	second, and she gives him a smile before going back to 	work.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir...

I think I'll have to add 			her name to my list of interviews.	He picks up a PADD and adds Leeta's name.					BASHIR			Interviews?					ZIMMERMAN			I'll be conducting in-depth 			interviews with your friends,			colleagues and family members. 			It'll help me build a more rounded 			psychological profile for the LMH.	Something about this statement causes Bashir a little 	concern. He starts to get into it just as ODO approaches.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Doctor Bashir... " - REV. 1/6/97 - ACT ONE    15.12   CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(casual)			I see.

The words come tumbling out of 	Julian -- it's a story he's never told anyone, but 	always thought he might, and once he starts, there's a 	rushed anxious quality to the tale as if he's glad to 	finally say it.					BASHIR			I was six.

Some kind of DNA 			recoding... ?					BASHIR			The technical term is "accelerated 			critical neural pathway formation." 			Over the course of the next two 			months, my genetic structure was 			manipulated to accelerate the 			growth of neuronal networks in my 			cerebral cortex. A new Julian 			Bashir was born.					O'BRIEN			In what ways did they... change 			you?					BASHIR			My... mental abilities were the 			top priority of course -- my IQ 			jumped five points a day for over 			two weeks. That was followed by 			improvements in my hand-eye 			coordination, reflexes, vision, 			stamina, height, weight -- in the 			end everything but my name was 			altered in some way.				(beat)			When we returned to Earth, we 			moved to a different city, I was 			enrolled in a new school using 			falsified records my parents 			obtained somewhere.

You don't know			what it's like to stay up every 			night worrying that maybe it's 			your fault. Maybe you did 			something wrong during the 			pregnancy, maybe you weren't 			careful enough, or maybe there's 			something wrong with you.
