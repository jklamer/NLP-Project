WARDROOM	Close on JAKE, who looks solemn and determined.					JAKE			Dad, there's something I've been 			wanting to say to you for a long 			time.  And now that I finally have 			the chance, I'm going to make it 			short and simple...2    NEW ANGLE	To reveal SISKO, standing at attention.  Jake reaches out 	and pins an additional pip on Sisko's collar.					JAKE			Congratulations, Captain Sisko.	Sisko smiles, and Jake gives him a hug.  The camera widens 	to reveal...3    CROWD OF WELL-WISHERS	Including KIRA, DAX, O'BRIEN, BASHIR, ODO, QUARK, LIEUTENANT 	COMMANDER EDDINGTON, and a number of Bajoran and Starfleet 	officers.  Also present is FEDERATION AMBASSADOR KRAJENSKY, 	a skilled career politician.	The senior staff immediately crowds around Sisko to offer 	their congratulations.					KIRA				(playful)			Now that you have another pip on 			your collar, does that mean I can't 			disagree with you anymore?					SISKO				(smiling)			No.  It just means I'm never 			wrong.					KIRA			We'll see about that.           DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - TEASER           2.3    CONTINUED:					DAX				(to Sisko)			Curzon would've been proud of you, 			but not as proud as I am.					SISKO			That means a lot to me, Dax.					ODO				(to Sisko)			Though I don't fully understand this 			humanoid obsession with rank and 			title, if anyone deserves to be 			promoted, it's you.					EDDINGTON			Well, as someone who is obsessed 			with rank and title...				(smiles)			Congratulations, captain.					O'BRIEN			That goes for me, too.  It's about 			time.	Quark approaches with a glass of champagne on a tray.					QUARK			This calls for a toast.					BASHIR				(re: the champagne)			That better not be from a replicator, 			Quark.					QUARK			Chateau Cleon, twenty-three-oh-three.				(smug)			I already put it on your account.	People begin taking glasses.  Jake picks one up, and looks 	at Dad.					JAKE			Can I?					SISKO			I guess a sip wouldn't hurt.	Everyone raises their glasses.					BASHIR				(to O'Brien)			Chief?           DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - TEASER          2A.3    CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN			To the newest, and best captain in 			Starfleet... All I can say is...				(raises his glass)			It's about time.	Everyone cheers and takes a sip.  Jake goes to take a 	second sip, but before he can, his father deftly takes the 	glass from his hand.					SISKO				(smiles)			That's enough.	Various crewmembers come up to shake Sisko's hand, as does 	Ambassador Krajensky.					SISKO			Thank you for coming, Ambassador.           DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - TEASER           3.3    CONTINUED:	(3)					KRAJENSKY			Those pips look good on you, Captain.  			Though to be honest, I'm not really 			here for the ceremony.	Krajensky and Sisko begin to walk away from the others, so 	they can speak privately.					SISKO				(not surprised)			I had that feeling.  What can I do 			for you?					KRAJENSKY			Our intelligence reports indicate 			there's been a coup d'etat on the 			Tzenkethi homeworld.					SISKO			I doubt anyone is going to miss the 			Autarch.					KRAJENSKY			I know I won't.				(a beat)			Unfortunately, it's too early to 			tell who's in control.  But we don't 			want to take any chances.  We need 			to remind the Tzenkethi that the 			Federation is committed to protecting 			our colonies near their border.					SISKO				(knows what he means)			You want to show the flag.					KRAJENSKY			Exactly.				(a beat)			The Defiant will leave in two days 			for a week-long patrol.  I'll be 			coming along as an observer.  I've 			heard a lot about the Defiant.  I'm 			looking forward to seeing her in 			operation.					SISKO			I don't think you'll be disappointed.  			She's a fine ship.           DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - TEASER           4.3    CONTINUED:	(4)					KRAJENSKY			With a fine crew.				(smiles)			Now what do you say we get back to 			the party?	Sisko smiles his acknowledgment, and he and Krajensky rejoin 	the others.  As Sisko walks toward them, O'Brien, Dax, and 	Bashir lead the crowd in a chorus of "For He's a Jolly Good 	Fellow."4    EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE - STOCK (OPTICAL)	With the Defiant docked at the outer ring.5    INT. DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM	This is a smaller area than we're used to for Engineering 	sections in Starfleet ships, but with a recognizable warp 	core stretching from floor to ceiling.  Sisko and O'Brien 	ENTER.					SISKO			I want a complete overhaul of the 			deflector shield generators and the 			targeting sensors.  And take on an 			extra complement of photon torpedoes.					O'BRIEN			Don't worry, Captain, if the Tzenkethi 			try to make trouble, we'll be ready 			for them.					SISKO			I don't doubt it, Chief.	Sisko EXITS, and O'Brien goes to work.6    NEW ANGLE	O'Brien kneels down, removes a panel and begins poking around 	inside.  Without the sound of conversation, the engine room 	has an ominous feel to it.  There are a number of dark corners 	and sharp shadows.  Plenty of places for someone to hide.	As O'Brien works, a shadow seems to move suddenly and rapidly 	behind him.  O'Brien catches the movement out of the corner 	of his eye.  He turns his head to see who's there.           DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - TEASER           5.6    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			Captain?	But there's no response and no one there.  Nothing moves.  	O'Brien looks around with a puzzled and somewhat unsettled 	expression.  He tries to shrug it off with a smile.  He must 	have been imagining things.					O'BRIEN			Getting jumpy in your old age, 			O'Brien.	O'Brien goes back to work.  And as we hold on his exposed 	and vulnerable back...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT ONE           6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)7    INT. DEEP SPACE NINE - TURBOLIFT	Sisko and Dax are in the Turbolift, headed for the docking 	ring.					DAX			So have you told her yet?					SISKO			Told who?					DAX			Captain Yates.  About your promotion.					SISKO			I barely had time to send a 			transmission to my father.  Anyway, 			I don't even know where Kasidy is.					DAX			She's hauling a load of duridium ore 			to Solais Five.  You could probably 			contact her on subspace.					SISKO			I'd rather tell her in person.					DAX			When's she due back on the station?					SISKO			About a month.	The Turbolift doors open and they EXIT into...8    INT. DOCKING RING CORRIDOR	As they start down the corridor.					DAX				(frowns)			A month?				(a beat)			There's nothing worse than a long- 			distance relationship.          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT ONE           7.8    CONTINUED:					SISKO			I wouldn't call it a relationship, 			Dax.  I only went out with her once.	Dax looks at him skeptically.					SISKO			All right, twice.					DAX			I believe the exact figure is three 			times.					SISKO				(smiles)			She's quite an interesting woman.  			Very independent.  A little 			opinionated, but she has a nice 			sense of humor.					DAX			And?					SISKO			What do you want me to tell you, 			Dax?					DAX			That you miss her... that you can't 			wait to see her... I don't know... 			anything.  Kira, O'Brien, Bashir, 			they're all dying of curiosity.  I 			have to tell them something.	Sisko and Dax reach the airlock.  The door opens and Dax 	starts up the steps.					SISKO			Fine.  Tell them that when she gets 			back, I plan on taking her to a 			holosuite to watch game seven of the 			nineteen sixty-four World Series.					DAX				(smiling)			You do like her.	Sisko doesn't deny it.  And as they ENTER the airlock...									CUT TO:          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT ONE           8.9    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE	Sisko and Dax ENTER the Bridge.  O'Brien, Kira, and Odo are 	already at their stations.  Ambassador Krajensky and Eddington 	are standing near the Captain's Chair.					EDDINGTON				(a traditional salute)			Captain on the bridge.	Dax takes her place at the helm and Sisko nods to Krajensky, 	then seats himself in the Captain's Chair.					SISKO			All stations report.					DAX			Helm ready.					KIRA			Weapons ready.					ODO			Communications systems standing by.					O'BRIEN			Warp and impulse engines on-line.					SISKO			Seal the airlock and release docking 			clamps.					DAX			Docking clamps released.					SISKO			Engage thrusters.					DAX			Clearing the station.					SISKO			Lay in a course to the Tzenkethi 			border, warp eight.					DAX				(smiling)			Aye, aye... captain.					SISKO			Engage.10   EXT.

DEFIANT - JEFFERIES TUBE (OPTICAL)	O'Brien is still working on systems upgrades while the ship 	is in route to Tzenkethi space.          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT ONE           9.11   CONTINUED:	Once again, stylistically, it's important to emphasize 	the Jefferies Tube as a claustrophobic, isolated place.  	It's not a comfortable place to be alone.	O'Brien's making some adjustments at an open panel when he 	hears a noise.  Trying to find the source of the noise, he 	looks down the tube.  There's an intersection up ahead.					O'BRIEN			Hello... who's there?	There's no answer.  O'Brien goes crawling forward to 	investigate, and just as he's about to turn the corner...	SHOCK CUT TO:12   SHADOWY FIGURE	Coming out from behind the corner.  O'Brien smacks right 	into him and for a second, O'Brien and the audience should 	think O'Brien's been attacked by an intruder.  But then 	O'Brien gets his bearings and we see it's...13   BASHIR	Looking guileless and innocent, carrying a TOOL CASE in one 	hand and a TOOL in the other.					BASHIR			You call me, Chief?					O'BRIEN			Julian, you scared me half to death.  			Why didn't you answer me?	Bashir holds up the tool.					BASHIR			I had this spanner in my mouth.					O'BRIEN				(still cranky)			What are you doing in here, anyway?					BASHIR			I was connecting my new diagnostic 			console into the medical bay's power 			grid.        DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - REV. 04/10/95 - ACT ONE       10.13   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			I would've done that for you.					BASHIR			Just putting those engineering 			extension courses to work.  Besides, 			I know you have your hands full.	Bashir begins crawling past O'Brien toward the access panel.					O'BRIEN			Now where are you going?	Bashir turns to O'Brien and then gives him a self-satisfied 	smile.					BASHIR			I'm done.	Bashir EXITS.  O'Brien waits a beat, thinks it over, and 	then instead of going back to his work, crawls around the 	corner.14   NEW ANGLE	As O'Brien opens a panel and examines the insides, double-	checking Bashir's work.					O'BRIEN				(begrudgingly)			Not bad.  For extension courses.	Satisfied, O'Brien closes the panel and crawls back around 	the corner.  But the camera lingers for a beat on this empty 	section of conduit.15   INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL	Since the quarters on the Defiant are so cramped, the ship 	is equipped with a small mess hall for dining and meetings.  	The room consists of four metal tables attached to the wall, 	plus a few replicators.	It's very submarine-like in its design and the girders of 	the hull structure are visible in the walls and ceiling.  	There are no windows and no decoration.  This is the crew's 	mess on a warship.	Sisko gets a raktajino from one of the replicators, as 	Eddington ENTERS.          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT ONE          11.15   CONTINUED:					EDDINGTON			You wanted to see me, sir?					SISKO			It's about Ambassador Krajensky.  I 			know Starfleet doesn't intend for 			this to be a combat mission, but 			just in case the Tzenkethi have other 			ideas, I want to make sure the 			ambassador is kept out of harm's 			way.					EDDINGTON			Yes, sir.  I'll see to it that if 			hostilities do occur, the ambassador 			is escorted off the bridge.	This is what Sisko wanted, but he knows it won't be as easy 	as Eddington makes it sound.					SISKO			He won't like it.					EDDINGTON				(smiles)			I won't let that bother me.					SISKO			Very good, commander.  That'll be 			all.	Eddington starts to leave, then turns around.  There's 	something on his mind.					EDDINGTON			Captain, I just want to say that I 			agree with what Chief O'Brien said.  			About your promotion.  It's about 			time.					SISKO			I appreciate the sentiment.  But you 			know, it doesn't really change 			anything.  I have the assignment I 			want, the crew I want... the rank 			doesn't make much difference.					EDDINGTON			You'd be surprised.  Let's face it... 			People don't enter Starfleet to become 			commanders... or admirals for that 			matter.        DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - REV. 04/10/95 - ACT ONE       12.15   CONTINUED:	(2)					EDDINGTON (Cont'd)			It's the Captain's Chair that everyone 			has their eye on.				(a beat)			That's what I wanted when I joined 			up.

Leads from the device are 	attached to a number of different locations inside the panel.          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT TWO          16.	As O'Brien and Dax watch, another cable snakes out of the 	device and clamps onto a system inside the bulkhead, like an 	octopus grasping with a tentacle.  It's an eerie, disturbing 	sight.23   INCLUDE DAX AND O'BRIEN	As they react to this bizarre sight.					O'BRIEN			I've never seen anything like this.	Dax scans the device with a tricorder.					DAX			It's spreading through the system 			like some kind of parasite.					O'BRIEN			It seems to be linked to key points 			within the transceiver assembly.  			We'd better get it out of there.	Dax nods her agreement.  O'Brien takes a tool and reaches 	into the panel.24   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As O'Brien reaches for the device, he is zapped by a 	forcefield.  Unlike our normal security fields, this one 	hurts.  The pain makes O'Brien drop the tool.					O'BRIEN			What the...	Dax scans the panel.					DAX				(surprised)			A forcefield.	O'Brien thinks for a beat, then crawls down the Jefferies 	Tube.					O'BRIEN			Come on.					DAX			Where are you going?          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT TWO          17.24   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			To check the other Command Systems.  			I've got a bad feeling about this.25   EXT.

DEFIANT - ENGINE ROOM (OPTICAL)	Sisko, Dax, and O'Brien are examining another open panel 	with a similar device to the one in the communications system.  	As they watch, it sends out a tentacle.					SISKO			You say these things are all over 			the ship.					O'BRIEN				(nods)			They've attached themselves to the 			command and communication relays, 			the internal sensors, the transporter, 			the deflector shield grid, almost 			every critical system.					SISKO			Is there any way to get past the 			forcefields?					O'BRIEN			None that we've found.  But we're 			still working on it.					SISKO			So I guess the question is, how did 			these devices get aboard?	There's a beat as the three of them look at each other.  	They know the answer, but they're not eager to voice their 	suspicions.					SISKO			Or should I say... who placed them 			here?					O'BRIEN			I don't know who it was, but it 			definitely happened after we left 			the station.        DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - REV. 04/10/95 - ACT TWO       18.26   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			I did a complete systems check before 			our departure, and they weren't here 			then.					SISKO				(grim)			Then someone aboard this ship is a 			saboteur.	As much as they want to, neither Dax nor O'Brien can deny 	the truth of Sisko's statement.					DAX			We've got forty-seven people on board.  			Theoretically, anyone of them could've 			planted these devices.	Sisko notices that O'Brien looks disturbed by something.					SISKO			Chief?					O'BRIEN			It's nothing, sir.  It's not even 			worth mentioning.					SISKO			You don't sound too sure about that.					O'BRIEN			Well, it's just... I did see someone 			crawling around one of the Jefferies 			Tubes the other day...					SISKO			Who?					O'BRIEN				(reluctantly)			It was Julian.				(quickly)			He was connecting a medical console 			into the power grid.					SISKO			Which is right next to the 			communications relay.					DAX			Are you accusing Julian of sabotage?          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT TWO          19.26   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			No one's accusing anyone of anything.				(reluctantly)			But I want to talk to Julian.					DAX			Wait.

Sisko is addressing the group.					SISKO			This crew has been through a lot 			together.  I'd trust any one of you 			with my life.  But... after looking 			at the evidence, there's only one 			conclusion I can draw.  Someone on 			this ship is guilty of sabotage.28   NEW ANGLE	As we pan across the faces of the crew.  All of them are 	uncomfortable with this idea.  They look at each other, not 	exactly with suspicion, but with a slight uneasiness.29   ANGLE ON BASHIR	Who looks concerned and serious about what he's hearing.30   ANGLE ON EDDINGTON	Who does not seem happy at all.

But not for much longer.  They 			dissipate quickly.					ODO			So you're going to scan all the 			members of the crew for tetryon 			particles?					SISKO			Starting with the senior staff.					DAX			O'Brien and I already scanned 			positive, since we opened up the 			warp core controls during our 			investigation.					EDDINGTON			You realize, of course, that if no 			one else tests positive...					O'BRIEN			We'll be the prime suspects.

He's not surprised, but he's deeply concerned 	by the implications.46   INT. MESS HALL	Gathered in the room are Sisko, Kira, Bashir, Odo and 	Eddington.  Sisko is the focus of the meeting as the senior 	officers update him on the situation.					EDDINGTON			Our security teams have gone over 			every centimeter of the ship... 			checked every piece of cargo... 			questioned every crewmember.  We 			still haven't been able to find the 			changeling.					SISKO			Is there any way he could've been 			transported off the ship?					EDDINGTON			At warp?  It's unlikely.  But with 			Dominion technology... I suppose 			it's possible.					ODO				(with certainty)			He's still here.	There's a beat of silence as Sisko, Kira, Bashir and Eddington 	react to Odo.  They know he's right.					ODO			He won't leave until he's completed 			his mission.					BASHIR			Which is?       DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - REV. 04/10/95 - ACT THREE      26.46   CONTINUED:					SISKO			It looks like the Dominion is hoping 			to start a war between the Federation 			and the Tzenkethi.					KIRA			If you ask me, the Tzenkethi are 			doing a pretty good job of that all 			by themselves.					SISKO			Not necessarily.  The transmission 			we saw from Barisa Prime could've 			been faked using that device we found 			implanted in the communications relay.	This is disturbing news for everyone.  They all feel exposed 	and vulnerable, not able to trust anything about their 	situation.					SISKO			In fact, our entire mission could've 			been engineered by the Dominion.				(off reactions)			Think about it.  We've been all over 			this ship, and we haven't seen a 			trace of the real Ambassador 			Krajensky... or his remains.	Eddington sees what Sisko's getting at.					EDDINGTON			Which means he was probably replaced 			before we left the station.					ODO			Maybe the real ambassador never came 			to Deep Space Nine at all.					BASHIR			Then anything Ambassador Krajensky 			told us could be a lie.  The Tzenkethi 			coup d'etat, the increased tension 			along the border, the threat of an 			attack...	Sisko sees that the situation is pretty dire.					SISKO			And now here we are, cloaked, armed 			for battle, and headed into Tzenkethi 			territory.         DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT THREE         26.46   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO				(determined)			If we don't stop this ship before we 			reach the border, we may wind up 			causing a war instead of preventing 			one.					ODO			Which is no doubt what my people are 			hoping for.  A war between the 			Tzenkethi and the Federation would 			destabilize the Alpha Quadrant, and 			make it that much easier for the 			Dominion to move in.	There's a growing sense of tension in the room.  Even though 	they outnumber the Shape-shifter fifty to one, there's a 	feeling that the deck is stacked against them.					EDDINGTON			I wish the internal sensors were on-			line.  It'd make it a lot easier to 			track down the changeling.					ODO			I'm not sure sensors would help.  If 			you scan me when I'm a rock, you'd 			detect a rock.  I may not be able to 			duplicate a humanoid perfectly, but 			I'm guessing he can.					BASHIR				(confirming)			When we scanned "Ambassador Krajensky" 			for tetryon particles, he registered 			as human.					KIRA			Then right now the changeling could 			be anything or anyone on this ship.47   NEW ANGLE	As we pan across the faces of the senior staff.  No one wants 	to think that one of their friends and colleagues may be the 	Shape-shifter, but they can't deny the possibility.

DEFIANT - ANOTHER JEFFERIES TUBE (OPTICAL)	Sisko and another Security Officer pick their way carefully 	down yet another of the Defiant's cramped, dark maintenance 	conduits.  They reach a ladder, which leads deeper into the 	bowels of the ship.	Sisko "sterilizes" the ladder with his modified phaser rifle, 	then slings the rifle strap over his shoulder.					SISKO			Watch my back.62   NEW ANGLE	As Sisko climbs down the ladder.  He moves slowly, keeping 	one hand on the trigger of the phaser rifle.	It's difficult to keep the phaser trained on the bottom of 	the ladder while descending, but Sisko's doing his best.	In the middle of the ladder, Sisko reaches a four-way 	intersection.  A tube leads off both to Sisko's right and 	left, and the ladder continues down to a lower deck.          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT FOUR         37.62   CONTINUED:	Sisko stops just above the intersection.

I saw you come out of 			that hatch and go around the corner.	Kira steps closer to Sisko and the Bolian.					KIRA			I didn't see anyone.  Maybe he morphed 			into the ventilation system.				(growing suspicious)			Or maybe he didn't.  For all we know, 			you could be the changeling.	Kira continues approaching Sisko and the Bolian.					BOLIAN			Keep back.	Sisko looks from Kira to the Bolian, not sure whether he can 	trust either one of them.					SISKO				(an order)			Both of you put your weapons down.75   CLOSE ON THE BOLIAN	As he looks from Kira to Sisko.  He's in over his head.  For 	all he knows, Sisko could be the Shape-shifter.					BOLIAN			I can't do that, Captain.					KIRA				(to the Bolian)			You heard him...	But as Kira steps forward, the Bolian suddenly takes aim at 	Kira and just as he's about to fire...          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT FOUR         40.76   NEW ANGLE	We hear the sound of a morph and a changeling's hand grabs 	his phaser rifle and jerks it away.  Sisko, Kira, and the 	Bolian turn just in time to see...77   ODO	Tosses aside the rifle with one hand and decks the Bolian 	with the other.  Eddington jogs up the corridor to join the 	group.  He looks down and sees one of his Security Officers 	lying on the ground.					EDDINGTON			What happened?78   CLOSE ON SISKO	As he looks from Kira to Odo to Eddington to the unconscious 	Bolian.					SISKO				(to Odo)			How long have you two been apart?	Odo looks over at Eddington and they both realize what Sisko's 	getting at.					ODO				(chagrined)			At least a minute.					SISKO			Then we've got a problem.  Any of us 			could be the changeling.				(to Odo)			You, Kira, Eddington... even me.79   CLOSE ON ODO	He'd like to say otherwise, but he can't.  He knows Sisko's 	right... or almost right.  Something near Sisko's foot catches 	his eye.					ODO			Not you.					SISKO			What do you mean?					ODO			You're bleeding.       DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - REV. 04/10/95 - ACT FOUR       41.79   CONTINUED:					SISKO				(not following)			I cut my hand when the Changeling 			attacked me.					EDDINGTON				(to Odo)			What are you getting at?80   NEW ANGLE	Odo indicates a spot on the floor by Sisko's feet.

Sisko hits his combadge.					SISKO				(to com)			Sisko to Bashir.					BASHIR'S COM VOICE			This is Bashir.					SISKO			Doctor, meet us in the Mess Hall 			immediately.	And off this...									CUT TO:81   INT. MESS HALL	Bashir draws blood from the Bolian using a high-tech syringe.  	Sisko, Kira, Odo, and Eddington watch the procedure.					BASHIR			This should only take a second.          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT FOUR         42.81   CONTINUED:	Bashir injects the Bolian's blood (it's blue) into a clear 	glass vial, then hands it to Sisko.	Sisko holds the vial up to the light and examines it.  The 	blood remains blue.82   ANGLE ON THE BOLIAN	Looking relieved.					BOLIAN			Satisfied?	Sisko puts the vial into the rack.					SISKO			So far.					BASHIR			Who's next?					KIRA			I'll go.	Bashir draws some blood from Kira, drips it into a vial, 	holds it up to the light, and shakes it a little.  It stays 	red.					BASHIR			I'd say the major is exactly who she 			appears to be.					KIRA				(to the Bolian)			Try not to look so surprised.	Bashir places the vial in the replicator and we hear it 	activate and dispose of the vial.					BASHIR				(to Eddington and 				Sisko)			There doesn't seem to be much of a 			point in obtaining a sample from the 			Constable, so I guess that leaves 			the three of us.	Eddington steps forward.					EDDINGTON			Let's get this over with.          DEEP SPACE: "The Adversary" - 04/07/95 - ACT FOUR         43.82   CONTINUED:	Bashir repeats the same procedure we saw above.  He draws 	the blood, takes the syringe over to the rack of vials, 	selects a vial (although he blocks the rack of vials for a 	second as he does so), drips in the blood, and holds it up 	to the light.83   CLOSE ON THE VIAL (OPTICAL)	But this time, after a few seconds, the blood MORPHS into 	orange goo.84   NEW ANGLE	As everyone reacts, and Kira levels her rifle at Eddington.					KIRA			I think you'd better come with me.85   CLOSE ON EDDINGTON	As he reacts to the rifle.
