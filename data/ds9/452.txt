QUARK'S	The bar is jumping and the dabo table is particularly busy 	as an ALIEN HIGH ROLLER racks up win after win.  QUARK is 	watching the game from behind the bar with a look of anxiety.  	The High Roller spins the dabo wheel and everyone watches 	the wheel go around.	The dabo girl, a beautiful twenty-year-old Bajoran girl named 	MARDAH, takes this opportunity to look over at JAKE, who is 	seated at a nearby table watching her.  Their eyes meet and 	we realize that the attraction between the two of them is 	very mutual.  The High Roller (who's a little drunk) wins 	again and Mardah turns her attention back to the game.					MARDAH			Dabo!	The crowd CHEERS, the High Roller collects his large winnings, 	and looks like he's going to leave the table.  Quark gets a 	definite look of panic on his face, but Mardah moves in closer 	to the High Roller.					MARDAH			You're not leaving?					HIGH ROLLER			Well...					MARDAH				(seductive)			Come on... aren't you feeling... 			lucky?	The High Roller looks at her and just can't help himself.					HIGH ROLLER			All right... one more time.  Let it 			ride.	The High Roller holds up a large bar of latinum and looks at 	Mardah expectantly.  Mardah moves closer and gives the bar of 	latinum a sensual kiss and gives him a seductive look.  The 	High Roller looks her over appreciatively and then puts the 	bar down on the table.        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 08/31/94 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED:					HIGH ROLLER			I love this game.	He spins the wheel and the crowd looks on eagerly.  Mardah 	rolls her eyes over at Jake and mouths his words mockingly.					MARDAH				(silently mocking)			"I love this game."	Jake laughs a little and then Mardah turns back in time to 	see the wheel stop spinning.					MARDAH			Oh... Karjinko.  Sorry.	A Ferengi Waiter standing nearby begins scooping up the 	latinum that a moment ago belonged to the High Roller.  Quark 	starts breathing again and he turns to other business at the 	bar.  The Crowd breaks up and another gambler steps up to 	play.  Mardah is relieved by a new dabo girl and begins to 	move off... the High Roller makes an awkward drunken pass at 	her.					HIGH ROLLER			Wait a minute there... my name's 			Okalar... what's yours?					MARDAH			"Busy."	Mardah flashes him a smile and then she moves over to Jake's 	table.  The High Roller looks surprised at her choice of 	companion... but then shakes his head sadly -- it's been one 	of those days -- and he moves off.  Mardah gives Jake a quick 	hello kiss and then sits down.  Jake and Mardah have been 	seeing each other for some time now and their relationship 	has an easy comfort to it.					JAKE				(smiling at her)			You... are evil.	Mardah grabs a drink off a passing waiter's tray.					MARDAH				(innocent)			Who, me?					JAKE			He was going to walk away a winner...           DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - 08/30/94 - TEASER           3.1    CONTINUED:	(2)					MARDAH			The first rule of dabo is watch the 			wheel, not the girl.					JAKE				(overlapping)			"... the wheel, not the girl."					MARDAH			Not to mention the fact that Quark 			was watching me every second... if I 			didn't at least try to keep that 			money in the house, he would've fired 			me on the spot.				(beat)			And, you're a fine one to talk after 			hustling that poor Berellian at dom-			jot yesterday.					JAKE			It was a fair game.					MARDAH			Uh huh.	Mardah is definitely teasing him here and Jake knows that 	she's not really accusing him of cheating.					JAKE			It was.					MARDAH			I believe you.	Jake smiles a little sheepishly and takes a drink.  There's 	a quiet beat before Mardah moves on to the next topic.					MARDAH			So what's on the menu tomorrow night?				(off his blank look)			Tomorrow night?  Dinner?  With your 			father?					JAKE				(shocked)			What?					MARDAH			He didn't tell you?  He came by this 			afternoon and invited me to dinner 			tomorrow night.  In fact, he said it 			was your idea.        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 08/31/94 - TEASER       4-5.1    CONTINUED:	(3)					JAKE			My idea... ?				(suddenly remembering)			Oh... I guess I did mention something 			about having you over a while ago... 			I thought he forgot...					MARDAH			This is all right, isn't it?  I 			mean... you don't mind, do you?					JAKE			Oh, no... no, of course not...	He pushes his doubts aside and sounds much more upbeat and 	confident, trying to reassure her.					JAKE			It'll be great.  You're going to 			love my dad's cooking.	Mardah smiles at him, relieved by his more positive attitude.  	They hold hands and move closer together.        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 08/31/94 - TEASER         6.1    CONTINUED:	(4)	At this moment, the beautiful BOSLIC CAPTAIN, (last seen 	in "The Homecoming") walks by their table and we FOLLOW HER 	as she heads for the bar and takes a seat next to Quark, who 	is working on a PADD.  Quark looks up at her in surprise as 	she gives him a seductive smile.					QUARK			This is a surprise.					BOSLIC			A pleasant one, I hope.					QUARK				(suggestive)			So do I...					BOSLIC			I have some... salvage for you, Quark.	Quark glances back over his shoulder.					QUARK			This isn't the best day to be selling 			your kind of... "salvage."					BOSLIC			Oh, it's perfectly legal... and it's 			really salvage this time.					QUARK			I'm not looking for junk right now...				(puts hand on her leg)			I'm more in the market for... 			entertainment.					BOSLIC			I think you'll like this junk, Quark.  			It's the wreckage of a ship that 			crashed in the Gamma Quadrant.					QUARK				(surprised)			You're still going to the Gamma 			Quadrant?				(smiles)			I love bold women.  How much?					BOSLIC			Three bars of latinum and you get it 			all.        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 08/31/94 - TEASER         7.1    CONTINUED:	(5)	Quark considers this for a moment.  She leans over and 	caresses his ears... distracting Quark.					QUARK			What kind of ship?					BOSLIC			I don't know.					QUARK			Can I see it first?					BOSLIC			No time.  Come on, Quark... we've 			been doing business for years... 			don't you trust me?	The Boslic Captain nuzzles his neck and Quark's eyes nearly 	pop out of his head.									CUT TO:2    INT. CARGO BAY	Quark is looking over a large amount of WRECKAGE strewn across 	the floor, with a dismayed look on his face.  The burnt and 	twisted pieces of equipment don't look very promising.					QUARK				(to himself)			Three bars of latinum...	He rubs an ear and then smiles.					QUARK				(continuing)			It was worth it.	Quark begins poking around the wreckage... looking for 	anything of real value.  Suddenly there is a muffled WAILING 	SOUND.  Quark stops... looks over a large cylinder on the 	deck... he hears the WAILING again.					QUARK			No...	Quark goes to the cylinder... the wailing is getting louder... 	his expression becomes disbelieving.					QUARK			No, no, no...        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 08/31/94 - TEASER        7A.	He steels himself and then OPENS the cylinder... and we can 	hear the unmistakable SCREAMING of an INFANT.  As the baby 	cries, Quark looks as if the weight of the galaxy just fell 	on his shoulders.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - 08/30/94 - ACT ONE           8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:3    EXT.

SISKO 	is glaring at Quark.					SISKO			You bought a child.					QUARK			I thought I was just buying some 			wreckage... how was I supposed to 			know there was a baby in there?					SISKO			Maybe you should inspect the 			merchandise before making the deal... 			or isn't there a rule of acquisition 			covering that?					QUARK			There is, and I do... usually.	DAX ENTERS.					DAX				(to Sisko)			We haven't been able to trace the 			Boslic Captain since she left the 			station.  Her flight plan said she's 			headed for Risa, but I don't think 			we can put much faith in that.	Bashir finishes his examination and moves to the others.					BASHIR			I haven't been able to identify his 			species yet, but he seems to be 			healthy...					SISKO			Seems?        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 08/31/94 - ACT ONE        9.4    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			For a humanoid, he has an incredibly 			high metabolic rate.  The cells in 			his body are dividing at a pace I've 			never seen outside of a laboratory.  			Since there're no thyroid or 			hypothalamic problems, I can only 			assume this is normal for his 			species... but I think he should 			remain here for further tests.					SISKO			Very well.				(to Dax)			What do we know about the ship the 			boy was on?					DAX			Chief O'Brien's just started analyzing 			the wreckage.  He should have a 			preliminary report in a couple of 			hours.					QUARK			Now wait a minute -- I paid good 			money for that wreckage and...	Sisko gives him a deadly look.					QUARK				(changing his tune)			... now it's yours.

Sisko moves the blanket aside to peer 	at the tiny alien.					SISKO				(to baby)			Hi there...5    ON INFANT	The BABY'S skin coloration is unusual and tells that he's 	definitely alien.6    RESUME SCENE	Sisko looks at the child for a moment... his features soften 	at the sight... and he can't help but smile slightly.					DAX			We should contact one of the 			orphanages on Bajor and let them 			know we might have someone for them.	Sisko doesn't respond right away and Dax and Bashir both 	look at him for a moment.  After a beat, Sisko realizes she 	was talking to him.					SISKO			Hmmm?					DAX			I was talking about an orphanage...					SISKO			Oh.  Right.				(to Bashir)			Have Major Kira make the appropriate 			arrangements.				(looks down at child)			And keep me informed about... him.        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 08/31/94 - ACT ONE       11.6    CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Yes, sir.	Sisko and Dax EXIT to...7    INT.

Dax watches Sisko 	for a few steps with a smile on her face.					SISKO			What?					DAX			I haven't seen that look on your 			face since...					SISKO			... since Jake stopped wearing diapers.	Sisko can't help but smile again at the memory.					SISKO				(continuing)			I never thought I'd hear myself saying 			this... but I miss taking care of 			Jake when he was a baby.  I miss 			holding him... singing to him at 			night... feeding him...					DAX			Listening to him cry... changing his 			diapers... worrying when he was 			sick...					SISKO			I haven't forgotten...				(beat)			But there are times when I would 			give almost anything for the days 			when I could make Jake happy... just 			by lifting him over my head.	Sisko smiles at the memory and the two friends walk off 	through the Promenade.									CUT TO:        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 08/31/94 - ACT ONE       12.8    INT.

Jake is 	sitting at the table and Sisko gives him a big smile.					SISKO			Jake... how about a hug for your old 			man?	But it quickly becomes apparent that Jake is not in a hugging 	mood.					JAKE			Why didn't you tell me you were going 			to invite Mardah to dinner?	Sisko sighs as he puts aside the warm fuzzy images of being 	the father of an infant to deal with his teenaged son.					SISKO			I did.  Weeks ago.  I told you if 			you didn't invite her soon, I'd do 			it myself.					JAKE			I still wish you'd given me a little 			more warning.					SISKO			I didn't realize a dinner invitation 			required so much... warning.					JAKE			It doesn't... and it's not a problem 			or anything.

INFIRMARY	The Boy is sitting on a biobed, as Bashir checks him over 	with a tricorder and Sisko looks on.  The Boy has an innate 	intelligence and intensity about him... he watches everything 	carefully as if he were consuming information for later study.  	This intensity, combined with the naturally innocent qualities 	of a child should produce an eerie, disturbing feeling to 	the Boy whenever we see him.  Physically, his skin is now 	obviously leathery and slightly beaded... his face shows 	some signs of what will later be the distinctive Jem'Hadar 	bone structure, but at this point, he should not be an obvious 	Jem'Hadar.					BASHIR				(to Sisko)			There are a great many species with 			what we would consider accelerated 			growth rates.  But they're usually 			small, physiologically simple 			creatures.  I've never heard of such 			a rapid maturation process in anything 			as complex as a humanoid.					SISKO			He looks about... eight or nine... 			how old is he in really?					BASHIR			From his cellular kinetics profile, 			I'd say he's no more than two weeks 			of age.					BOY			Who are you?	Sisko and Bashir are startled by this simple question and 	exchange a bewildered look.  Sisko then moves closer to the 	Boy... speaks slowly and clearly, as if to a very young child.					SISKO			I'm Benjamin Sisko, this is Doctor 			Bashir.

Do you 			know what that is?					BOY				(thinks)			No.  But I want to learn.	Sisko and Bashir can't help but smile at this remarkable 	child.					SISKO			I'd say we have a lot to learn from 			each other.	The Boy nods sagely, as if this is a profound truth.  Sisko 	inclines his head at Bashir, indicating that he wants to 	talk privately.					BASHIR				(to Boy)			I'll be right back.	Bashir and Sisko move across the room for a quiet talk.					SISKO				(quiet)			Advanced language skills...					BASHIR			And cognitive reasoning.  He didn't 			just pick those up by sitting there 			listening to us... this is either a 			natural ability of his species or 			there's been some kind of basic 			intelligence implanted into his 			genetic structure.        DEEP SPACE: "The Abandoned" - REV. 09/07/94 - ACT TWO       18.13   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			Implanted?  You mean artificially?					BASHIR			Yes.  And I tend to discount the 			possibility that this is a natural 			ability... his biomolecular diffusion 			gradient already suggests that his 			cellular mitosis has been artificially 			enhanced.					SISKO			So he may have been part of some 			kind of experiment.					BASHIR			Possibly.  If so, he's an example of 			very advanced genetic engineering... 			his cognitive abilities are developing 			without any external stimuli.					SISKO			I want you to test his mental 			abilities... see if they increase... 			maybe he'll get to the point where 			he can tell us who he is and where 			he comes from.	Bashir nods and Sisko heads for the EXIT.									CUT TO:14   INT.
