RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)	The Orinoco traveling at impulse.					DAX (V.O.)			Science Officer's Log, Stardate 			47603.3.  Commander Sisko has assigned 			me to investigate an unusual particle 			field detected on the other side of 			the wormhole.  Odo has come along as 			he often does on Gamma Quadrant 			missions, hoping to find a clue to 			his origin.2    INT. RUNABOUT	DAX is piloting the runabout, while running a series of scans 	and regaling ODO with an involved and, to Odo, pointless 	story.					DAX			So you see... Ensign Manwaring has 			spent the last two weeks avoiding 			the assay office because he thought 			that Freyla was in love with 			Lieutenant Strek, but all the time, 			Strek was seeing Security Officer 			Seelee and Freyla was waiting for 			Manwaring to ask her out.					ODO			Officer Seelee has seemed... 			distracted at work lately.				(a beat)			I'm going to have to talk to her 			about this when I get back to the 			station.					DAX				(reproachful)			Odo, I didn't tell you that story to 			get Seelee in trouble.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - TEASER             2.2    CONTINUED:					ODO			Frankly, Lieutenant, I fail to see 			any point in your story at all, except 			perhaps to illustrate the foolish 			humanoid preoccupation with romantic 			coupling.					DAX			The point of the story is that 			sometimes we don't recognize true 			love even when it's staring us right 			in the face.					ODO				(sarcastic)			How fascinating.					DAX			Let me give you another example... 			You know Lysia Arlin?	It's more a statement than a question.					ODO			The Bolian woman who runs the Jumja 			kiosk.					DAX			I've noticed she's been making a lot 			of visits to the Security Office 			lately.					ODO			She has a cousin who's interested in 			a career in law enforcement.					DAX				(not believing that 				excuse for a second)			You don't say.	Odo stares at Dax for a beat and then realizes what she's 	hinting at.					ODO			Are you implying that Lysia Arlin is 			interested in me?	Dax smiles.  That's exactly what she's implying.					ODO			Ridiculous... I would have noticed.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - TEASER             3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX				(triumphant)			Exactly my point.					ODO			You must be mistaken.					DAX			How can you be so sure?					ODO			Because women don't react to me in 			that manner.					DAX				(delicately)			Are you telling me that you've never 			had a... female friend?					ODO			I consider Major Kira a friend.					DAX			That isn't what I meant.  I'm talking 			about... an intimate friendship.	Odo gets the drift.  He instantly becomes very uncomfortable.					ODO			That's a very personal question.					DAX			I'm sorry, but after seven lifetimes, 			the impersonal questions aren't much 			fun anymore.					ODO			Why is it that whenever you do 			something socially unacceptable, you 			blame it on being a Trill?					DAX				(playful)			Why is it that whenever you get 			flustered, you start sounding like 			you're conducting a police 			investigation?	Odo harumphs.  Luckily, before Dax can press any further, 	one of the displays on her panel comes to life.  Odo and Dax 	turn their attention to the controls.          DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/10/93 - TEASER          4.2    CONTINUED:	(3)					DAX			Looks like we found that particle 			field.				(mild surprise)			They're Omicron particles.					ODO			Is that unusual?					DAX			Omicron particles are incredibly 			rare.  They can only be created by 			certain types of matter/anti-matter 			reactions.				(off monitor)			The field seems to be coming from 			the second planet in this system.  			Let's go in a little closer.3    EXT. SPACE - RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)	The Orinoco changes course.4    INT. RUNABOUT	Odo and Dax consult the Runabout sensor readouts.					DAX			That's strange.  The particles are 			concentrated in one small valley.  			And look at these field 			fluctuations...					ODO				(looks)			Totally non-random.					DAX			Someone or something must be 			manipulating the field.	Odo checks another set of sensors.					ODO			Sensors aren't picking up any life 			forms.          DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/10/93 - TEASER          5.4    CONTINUED:					DAX			The particle field could be 			interfering with the sensors.				(gets up)			We'd better beam down and take a 			look.5    EXT. YOSHADRAN SETTLEMENT - NIGHT	Odo and Dax walk into the center of an alien village (having 	just beamed in off-camera) and approach a complex cylindrical 	structure, probably some kind of generator, covered with 	panels, circuitry and flashing diodes.  The surrounding 	village is hard to make out at night, but when we see it in 	the daylight, the architecture is distinctly non-human, yet 	open and inviting.  Dax tries to take readings with her 	tricorder.					DAX			I'm still getting a lot of 			interference.  The particle field 			must be blocking the tricorder 			functions.	Dax moves the tricorder around until it's pointed toward the 	generator.					DAX			The interference seems to be coming 			from here.				(re: the generator)			This must be the source of the field.  			It's probably some kind of matter/anti-			matter reactor.					ODO			Lieutenant, I suggest we leave before 			we're discovered.					DAX				(still studying 				generator)			Give me another minute.	As they are talking, we hear the sounds of voices in the 	distance.  Beams of light cut the darkness.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - TEASER            5A.6    NEW ANGLE	As first one, then another, then a half-dozen humanoid aliens, 	equipped with portable lights, emerge from the darkness.  	The aliens look frightened and surprised.					ODO				(ironic)			Take all the time you want.	One of the aliens (COLYUS) aims a phaser-like weapon at Odo 	and Dax.  And as Odo and Dax react.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                      DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - ACT ONE            6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)7    INT. QUARK'S	It's after hours and QUARK's alone in the bar, sitting at a 	Dabo table, occasionally giving the wheel a halfhearted 	spin.  There's a satchel on the table next to him.	Quark hears a CHIME and looks up.8    NEW ANGLE	To include the bar's front door, which is closed.  A shadowy 	figure can be seen through the window.					QUARK				(to himself)			It's about time.				(louder)			Enter.	The door opens and the figure steps in, still hard to make 	out.9    ANGLE ON QUARK	As he picks up the satchel and moves toward the door.					QUARK				(continuing)			Where have you been?  I've been 			waiting hours...	He trails off as the shadowy figure steps into the light.  	It's KIRA.					QUARK				(not who he was 				expecting)			Major?				(polite)			I'm sorry.  We're closed.  You'll 			have to come back in the morning.	Quark tries to shoo her out of the bar.  Kira doesn't budge.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - ACT ONE            7.9    CONTINUED:					KIRA			I didn't come here for a drink.				(cold)			I thought you might like to know... 			your cousin Kono just tried to come 			aboard the station...					QUARK				(feigned surprise)			Kono?  Here?  What an unexpected 			pleasure.					KIRA			He's gone, Quark.  When we tried to 			talk to him, he beamed onto a 			departing Tellarite freighter.					QUARK			There must be some mistake... Why 			would Kono be coming here?					KIRA			I wondered the same thing myself.  			So I did some checking.  Your cousin's 			wanted for robbing a museum on 			Cardassia Five.  My guess is that he 			thought someone here would help him 			sell the merchandise.					QUARK			Outrageous.  You have no proof of 			that.					KIRA			Quark, get this into that twisted 			little brain of yours... if you 			thought you were going to get away 			with anything while Odo's gone, think 			again.  I'm watching you.					ARK			Major, you make it sound like you 			don't like me.	Kira can't believe Quark's incredible understatement.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - ACT ONE            8.9    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA				("Are you crazy?")			Don't like you?				(dispassionate)			You collaborated with the Cardassians, 			you cheat your customers, and you're 			a danger to this station.  I don't 			just not like you.  I... despise 			you.	She leaves.					QUARK			I'm sorry I mentioned it.9A   OMITTED10   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS	SISKO and JAKE, both in night clothes, are having a late 	night snack.					JAKE			A job?  What do I need a job for?					SISKO			You're fifteen years old.  It's time 			you started taking on a little 			responsibility.				(trying another 				approach)			Look... Nog works, doesn't he?					JAKE				(begrudgingly)			Yeah.					SISKO			And you're almost as old as he is.  			I had a job at your age.  It was a 			terrific experience.					JAKE				(giving in)			All right.  I'll talk to Nog and see 			if he can get me a job at Quark's.					SISKO			I was thinking more along the lines 			of helping out Chief O'Brien.         DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/10/93 - ACT ONE          9.10   CONTINUED:					JAKE				(not thrilled)			Chief O'Brien?					SISKO			You like Chief O'Brien, don't you?					JAKE			He's okay... but I don't know anything 			about engineering.					SISKO			This is the perfect opportunity to 			learn.  Besides... it'll look great 			on your application to Starfleet 			Academy.	Which really sells it for Sisko, if not for Jake.					JAKE				(halfhearted)			Okay, I'll give it a try.					SISKO				(supportive smile)			That's all I ask.11thru   OMITTED1213   EXT. YADERAN SETTLEMENT - NIGHT	Re-establishing.14   INT. PROTECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT	Dax and Odo sitting across a desk from Colyus, the Yaderan 	colony's Protector, a combination mayor and sheriff.  The 	office is equipped with an array of alien tech equipment and 	Colyus is at work at a device that looks like a computer 	console, basically ignoring them.					ODO			Are you going to just sit there all 			night, or are you going to explain 			why you're holding us.	Colyus smiles and studies them for a bit.  He's middle-aged 	and a little overweight, friendly and soft-spoken by nature, 	and deceptively low key.      DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/10/93 - ACT ONE 10-11.        14   CONTINUED:					COLYUS			You say you're from the other side 			of the galaxy?					DAX			That's right.					COLYUS				(shaking his head in 				wonderment)			Amazing.  Our colony has never had 			visitors before, and now... we have 			two.         DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/13/93 - ACT ONE         12.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					DAX			We didn't mean to intrude.  In fact, 			we didn't even know there was a 			village here until we beamed down.  			So if it's all the same to you... 			we'll be on our way.	She starts to get up.  Colyus gestures for her to wait.					COLYUS			I'm afraid it's not that simple.	Colyus looks at Dax and Odo expectantly.  Odo recognizes the 	tactic.					ODO			Are we being accused of some kind of 			crime?					COLYUS			Have you committed one?					DAX				(offended)			We just arrived here.					COLYUS			So you keep saying.					DAX			If you want, you can check our ship's 			logs... they'll prove it to you.					COLYUS			Logs can be tampered with.				(turns to Odo)			You should know that... after all, 			you claim to be a Security Officer.					ODO			I am a Security Officer and I've had 			enough of this.  If we were guilty, 			we wouldn't even be here right now.  			I'll prove it.	He hits his communicator.					ODO				(to combadge)			Computer, one to beam up.         DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/10/93 - ACT ONE         13.14A  NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As Odo DEMATERIALIZES.  Colyus reacts, grabbing his weapon.					DAX				(smiling)			Don't worry.  He'll be back.	Just then, Odo RE-MATERIALIZES.					DAX			What did I tell you?					COLYUS				(to Odo)			Interesting... you disappearing like 			that.  I've got twenty-two people 			who've disappeared without a trace.					ODO				(intrigued)			Twenty-two people missing?  Did they 			all disappear at the same time?					COLYUS			No.  It started in the fall.  But 			the last victim vanished six hours 			ago.					DAX			Six hours ago, we weren't even in 			this system.  If you want, you can 			accompany us back to our station.  			They'll verify everything we've told 			you.	Colyus considers the situation, then puts his weapon down.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - ACT ONE           14.14A  CONTINUED:					ODO			Do you have any other suspects?	Colyus smiles wearily.					COLYUS				(defending himself)			You were my only ones.  I'm not saying 			everyone here is perfect.  We have 			some petty thefts, an occasional 			fight.  But kidnapping... or murder?  			We've never had anything like that 			before.					ODO			I see.  So naturally, when we 			arrived...					COLYUS			Naturally.					ODO				(theorizing)			I remember reading a report about a 			similar series of disappearances on 			Brinda Five.  Half the population of 			a small village vanished.					COLYUS				(very interested)			Did they ever find them?					ODO			As I recall, they'd been transported 			off the planet by Orion traders to 			work as forced laborers in their 			mining camps.				(a beat)			Have you scanned the area for signs 			of transporter activity?					COLYUS			It was the first thing I tried.  But 			I didn't find anything.	Colyus once again sizes up Odo and Dax.					COLYUS				(continuing)			I've been protector here for almost 			ten years.         DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/10/93 - ACT ONE         15.14A  CONTINUED:	(2)					COLYUS			And I like to think I'm pretty good 			at my job.  People trust me to solve 			their problems.  But whoever's behind 			these disappearances is a lot smarter 			than I am.  I have to admit, I'm 			starting to get desperate.					ODO			Maybe what you need is a little help.	Colyus grins, thankful for the offer to help.15   EXT. YADERAN SETTLEMENT - FRONT OF RURIGAN'S HOUSE					NIGHT			Dax, Odo, and Colyus approach the 			front of the house.  An elderly 			Yaderan man (RURIGAN) stands alone 			on the porch, looking out over the 			central square, lost in thought.					COLYUS				(calling to him)			Rurigan.	Rurigan looks down.  He's a craggy-faced old man with a blunt 	and combative manner.					RURIGAN				(examines Dax and Odo)			So these are the strangers I've heard 			about.  Shouldn't they be in a cell.					COLYUS			I'm satisfied they have nothing to 			do with the disappearances.  In fact, 			Odo here is a Security Officer.  			He's going to try to help us.					RURIGAN				(to Odo)			And how do you plan on doing that?					ODO			I understand your daughter was the 			latest victim.

ANOTHER PART OF YADERAN SETTLEMENT - NIGHT	An alien girl (TAYA) sits alone on a stairway, absentmindedly 	playing with an alien toy which vaguely resembles a large 	top.  Taya's about nine, and looks lost and forlorn.  She 	hears a noise... a footstep or some movement... and looks up 	and sees...17   ODO AND RURIGAN	walking toward her.  Odo's face is hidden by the darkness.					RURIGAN			Taya?	Rurigan steps into the light.  Odo follows and the beam of 	harsh light illuminates his face, making it look even more 	bizarre and unreal.18   ON TAYA	As she reacts to Odo's strange appearance, shying away.19   RESUME SCENE	Odo can't help but notice the girl's reaction.  Rurigan 	notices it, too.					RURIGAN			Don't be afraid, Taya.  He's a friend 			of Protector Colyus.  He just wants 			you to answer some questions.					TAYA			Do I have to?					RURIGAN			Not if you don't want to.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - ACT ONE           18.19   CONTINUED:	Odo glances at Rurigan, having hoped for a little more 	support.  He turns to the girl and tries to talk to her as 	gently as possible.					ODO			But it would help if I could talk to 			you about your mother's disappearance.	Taya looks even more forlorn.					TAYA			She hasn't disappeared.  She'll be 			back.	Odo is very uncomfortable with the situation, but feels he 	has to push on.					ODO			The last time you saw your mother... 			did she seem... upset about anything?  			Nervous maybe, or worried?					TAYA			She was fine.				(to Rurigan, pleading)			When will she come home?					RURIGAN			I don't know, Taya.	He puts a protective arm around her and she buries her head 	in his side.					RURIGAN			Let's go.  It's time for bed.					ODO			I'd like to ask a few more questions.					RURIGAN			It can wait 'til morning.20   ANGLE ON ODO	watching Rurigan escort his despondent granddaughter away.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - ACT ONE           19.20   CONTINUED:	As she's leaving, Taya looks back at Odo almost as if 	accusing him of causing her all this pain.

She's 	genuinely glad to see him, but there's a slight hint of an 	underlying nervousness.					KIRA			I wish you'd given us a little more 			notice.  We could've arranged a formal 			reception.					BAREIL				(smiles)			Exactly what I wanted to avoid.	There's a subtle difference in Bareil this time.  Where as 	before we've only see him "on duty," now he's a little more 	relaxed, more down to earth, maybe even a little vulnerable.  	Kira notices it, too.					KIRA			What brings you to the station?					BAREIL			Prylar Rhit invited me to speak at 			the station's shrine.				(a beat)			And to be honest, I've been looking 			for an opportunity to come see you.            DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - 12/09/93 - ACT TWO           22.24   CONTINUED:					KIRA			Really?				(surprised but pleased)			I'm honored.	Which isn't exactly the reaction he wanted.					BAREIL			Honored?

She's got him in a corner.					ODO			When I was younger, people were always 			asking me to change shape for them.  			They'd pretend to be my friends, but 			all they wanted was to see me become 			a chair... or an animal...

But when I went to get 			her for midday meal... she was gone.					ODO			How did she act, when you last saw 			her?					TAYA			Happy.  She was making a vase for 			Mister Depnen, the baker.

And so 			the changeling said "Yes I can." and 			he did... and then do you know what 			happened?					ODO				(gruff)			The Great Minra gobbled him up.					TAYA				(surprised)			How'd you know?					ODO			The changeling in your story wasn't 			very smart.	Taya absorbs this, then brightens.					TAYA			Could you turn into a loaf a 			greenbread?					ODO			I suppose I could.        DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/10/93 - ACT THREE        40.					TAYA			Show me.	Odo almost smiles.					ODO			And let you gobble me up?

Earlier today, 			Taya tried to reach past the edge... 			and her arm disappeared.					COLYUS			Is she all right?					ODO			She's fine.  Her arm rematerialized 			once she pulled it back inside.					COLYUS			Where exactly did this happen?					DAX			We could show you, if you'd like.         DEEP SPACE: "Shadowplay" - REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR        44.45   CONTINUED:	(3)					COLYUS				(grim)			I think you'd better.46   EXT.
