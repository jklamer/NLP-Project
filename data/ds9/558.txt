HOLOSUITE - LAS VEGAS LOUNGE - NIGHT	CLOSE ON ROM SINGING his heart out on stage, backed	by a single piano player in a tuxedo. What Rom 	lacks in talent, he makes up for with feeling.					ROM			... that's why the lady... that's 			why the lady... that's why the 			laaaaaady is a scamp.	As the song ends, we hear a pair of hands clapping.	ADJUST to reveal VIC FONTAINE, getting up from one 	of the front tables.					ROM 			So? What do you think?					VIC 			Not bad, but the lady is a tramp, 			not a scamp.					ROM				(thinking it over) 			Tramp, right. So do I get the "gig?"					VIC				(with regret) 			Sorry, pallie.					ROM 			But Doctor Bashir said you're 			looking for an opening act and I 			love to sing.					VIC 			I can tell. But two singers on 			the same bill... that's a one-way 			ticket to deadsville. I need 			someone to warm-up the audience 			for me -- you know, a comic.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - TEASER     2.1    CONTINUED:					ROM			A comic?					VIC			A comedian -- someone who can			make people laugh.					ROM			I can do that. My brother tells			me people are always laughing at			me.					VIC			That may be true -- but this is a			holosuite program, capice?					ROM			So?					Vic			So you're not a hologram.					ROM				(thinking it over)			Life can be so unfair.2    NEW ANGLE	as DOCTOR BASHIR ENTERS.					BASHIR			Hey, Vic -- you got a minute?					ROM			Forget it, he's not hiring.	And with that, Rom slumps away, EXITING.					BASHIR				(re: Rom)			What's wrong with him?					VIC			Showbiz -- it can break your			heart. So what can I do for			you, pallie?					BASHIR			Did you get a chance to make			those audio recordings for me?	Vic nods and reaches into his jacket pocket, takes 	out an isolinear rod.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - TEASER     3.2    CONTINUED:					VIC 			All your favorite hits.					BASHIR 			That's great, Vic. Thanks.					VIC 			My pleasure -- but these songs 			are four hundred years old... you 			sure the troops on the front 			lines want to hear them?					BASHIR 			The songs may be old, but when 			you sing them, they sound brand 			new.					VIC 			When you put it that way, I wish 			I was going on the supply run 			with you... I could make some 			personal appearances... sing a 			few songs, tell a few jokes... 			you know, put together a regular 			USO show.					BASHIR 			Sorry Vic, but I'm afraid there 			aren't any holosuites where we're 			going.					VIC				(to himself) 			Rom's right... life can be 			unfair.				(to Bashir) 			You know, pallie -- sometimes 			being a hologram can be a real 			pain in the asometric photons.					BASHIR 			I'll see you when I get back.	Bashir EXITS.					VIC				(more to himself) 			You know where to find me.2A   INT. WARDROOM	ANGLE ON THE DOOR OPENING to reveal ODO, holding a 	PADD, stepping into the room.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - TEASER    3A.2A   CONTINUED:					ODO 			I thought I might find you 			here...	ADJUST to reveal SISKO, alone, looking at a casualty 	list displayed on a wall monitor. Odo offers Sisko 	the PADD.					ODO			The new security protocols you 			requested.	Sisko takes the PADD, but his attention remains on 	the wall monitor.					SISKO 			I think that's what I'm going to 			remember most about this war... 			looking through casualty reports. 			Sometimes it feels like that's 			all I do... stare at the names of 			the dead.				(a beat) 			When the war started, I used to 			read every name... I felt it was 			the least I could do to honor 			their sacrifice. But lately, all 			the names have begun to blur 			together...					ODO			That's understandable.					SISKO			Maybe...	The moment is broken by --					KIRA'S COM VOICE 			Ops to Captain Sisko.					SISKO				(touching his com 				badge) 			Go ahead, colonel.					KIRA'S COM VOICE 			The Defiant is ready for 			departure.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - TEASER    3B.2A   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO 			On my way.	And as Sisko turns to EXIT --3    EXT.

DEFIANT - MESS HALL	CLOSE ON a miserable QUARK, seated at a table. With 	his head cupped in his hands, he stares morosely at 	a steaming cup of raktajino.					QUARK				(mumbling) 			Why me? Why did he have to send 			me? I'm like a son to him...	ADJUST to REVEAL EZRI, sitting at a nearby table, 	reading a PADD. Quark and Ezri are the only two 	people in the room.					EZRI 			Quark -- you're mumbling again.					QUARK 			I'm sorry.				(a beat, then				mumbling again)			It's just not fair... I have			responsibilities of my own...			customers who depend on me...	Ezri puts down her PADD, deciding the only way to 	quiet Quark is to try and lift his spirits.					EZRI 			But the Grand Nagus himself 			picked you for this assignment.					QUARK 			Some assignment... a fact-finding 			mission to the front lines. 			Zek's already inundated with 			Starfleet intelligence reports. 			What can I tell him that he 			doesn't know?					EZRI 			Maybe he wants to hear things 			from a Ferengi perspective.					QUARK 			Then let him ask Nog.					EZRI 			The Nagus trusts you.					QUARK 			What are you trying to do? Cheer 			me up?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - TEASER     5.4    CONTINUED:					EZRI 			It's my job. Remember the thirty-			fourth Rule of Acquisition, "War 			is good for business."					QUARK 			Only from a distance. The closer 			you are to the front lines, the 			less profitable it gets.	Suddenly, the ship is ROCKED HARD by a phaser blast.					QUARK 			What's that?	Ezri calmly gets to her feet and heads for the door.					EZRI 			Stay here.	And with that, she EXITS. Quark has no intention of 	doing what she says.					QUARK 			Wait. Don't leave.	ANOTHER SHIP SHAKE knocks Quark back into his seat. 	He quickly scrambles back up and heads for the door --5    OMITTED     DEEP SPACE NINE- "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - TEASER     6.6    INT. DEFIANT - CORRIDOR	As Quark staggers in one direction and then another, 	until he bumps into COMMANDER WORF. He grabs Quark 	by the shoulders to steady him.					WORF			This is no time to be wandering 			the corridors.					QUARK			I thought the Chin'toka System 			was in Federation hands.	The ship SHAKES again from another hit.					WORF			It is, but the Dominion is 			determined to take back their 			territory. The entire system is 			a battleground.					QUARK				(more to himself) 			I should probably be writing this 			down.	But another SHAKE forces Quark to grab hold of 	Worf's arm for support.									CUT TO:7    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE	as the doors open, allowing Worf and Quark to ENTER. 	They're just in time to see --     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - TEASER    6A.8    ANGLE ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	where the image of a Jem'Hadar fighter EXPLODES in a 	giant fireball.9    WIDER	on the crew, which includes Sisko, standing near NOG 	at the helm. O'BRIEN and Ezri are at the side 	consoles. The Bridge crew breaks out into 	triumphant smiles. Worf immediately sits at his 	console.					SISKO 			Mister O'Brien -- keep an eye out 			for more Jem'Hadar ships.					O'BRIEN			Aye, sir.	Not wanting to be sent back to the mess hall, Quark 	wanders over to Nog. But Nog is uncomfortable 	having his uncle looming over him.					NOG 			What are you doing here, uncle? 					QUARK 			I... ah... just visiting.					NOG				(embarrassed) 			I'm working.					SISKO 			Quark, is there something we can 			do for you?					QUARK 			Not really.				(all innocent)			I just came by to say hello to my 			nephew.					SISKO				(firm) 			All right, you've just said 			hello...     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - TEASER     7.9    CONTINUED:	But Quark just wants any excuse not to be left alone 	should they come under attack again.					QUARK 			Anybody want to join me in the 			mess hall for a raktajino?					SISKO			Quark!					QUARK				(making a hasty 				retreat) 			I was just leaving...	And with that, he does. An apologetic Nog turns to 	Sisko.					NOG 			Sir, I assure you that won't 			happen again.					EZRI				(to Nog) 			Your uncle's just a little 			nervous... he's not used to being 			in combat situations.					NOG 			That's no excuse.	And with that, Nog goes back to working his console.									DISSOLVE TO:10   EXT.

ROCKY TERRAIN OUTSIDE BASE CAMP - CONTINUOUS	As Sisko and the others huddle for cover behind the 	rock.					SISKO			Those are Federation phasers...				(calling out)			Hold your fire! This is Captain			Benjamin Sisko of the USS			Defiant.					FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)			You heard him -- cease fire, damn			it!	The firing stops.13B  NEW ANGLE	to see Sisko and the others emerge cautiously from 	behind the rocks.					SISKO			We're coming in.13C  ANGLE ON THE BASE CAMP	which is built into the rockface of a steep 	mountain, was originally constructed by the Dominion 	as a communications relay station, but the 	Federation has occupied it for the past five months.	Sisko and his crew pass through a barricade of 	crates, rocks and the twenty-fourth century 	equivalent of sandbags.	CHIEF LARKIN, a sinewy, steel-eyed woman in her mid-	thirties, is in mid-argument with VARGAS, a high-	strung young soldier who has a bloody cloth wrapped 	around one of his arms.					LARKIN			Who told you to open fire?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - ACT ONE   11A.13C  CONTINUED:					VARGAS 				(defensive) 			I saw movement. I thought it was 			the Jem'Hadar.					LARKIN 			They look like Jem'Hadar to you? 			I gave the word to hold your fire 			-- that Starfleet officers were 			beaming down with supplies.					VARGAS 				(shrugs) 			Nobody told me.	Larkin shakes her head with frustration as Sisko 	approaches her.					LARKIN 			Sorry, captain. A little 			breakdown in communications...					SISKO			No harm done.	Bashir, Ezri, Nog and Quark study the Starfleet 	personnel stationed along the barricade. At first 	glance, it's hard to believe that Sisko, Ezri, 	Bashir and Nog wear the same uniform as these 	people. They're not the crisp, clean and confident 	Starfleet officers we're accustomed to. These 	soldiers have been living on the front lines for the 	past five months and it shows... they're tired, 	dirty, hollow-eyed. They're also heavily armed. 	(Note: the soldiers should move around the base as 	little as possible; there's not a lot of aimless 	wandering going on for reasons that will be clear 	soon enough.)					SISKO			Where's Captain Loomis?					LARKIN 			He was killed ten days ago. So 			was Commander Parker.					SISKO			Then who's in command?					LARKIN 			I am. Chief Nadia Larkin.					SISKO			Ben Sisko. Where would you like 			your supplies?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - ACT ONE   11B.13C  CONTINUED:	(2)					LARKIN 			Vargas can show you.					VARGAS				(tightly wound) 			Supplies -- that's just great. 			Don't they know we need to get 			off this rock?	REESE, a stone-faced veteran, wearing a necklace of 	Jem'Hadar white tubes, stands near Larkin.					REESE 			Take it easy, Vargas.					VARGAS 			Take it easy? I'd love to take 			it easy. Just get me out of this 			vole-hole and I promise all I'll 			do, for the rest of my life, is 			take it easy! According to 			Starfleet regulations we're 			suppose to be rotated off the 			front lines after ninety days -- 			ninety days. We've been stuck 			here for five months!	A long uncomfortable beat; there's a simple, painful 	truth to what Vargas's saying. These people have 	clearly been under tremendous strain.					LARKIN				(to Sisko) 			Welcome to paradise, captain.	And off Sisko evaluating the situation --14   INT. BASE CAMP - 2ND LEVEL/COMMAND BUNKER - NIGHT	Sisko and Larkin are looking down at a large 	Dominion communications array which is being worked 	on by a half-dozen Starfleet technicians. Among 	them is KELLIN, a young, brash engineer. (Note: all 	the engineers wear hand phasers.) Ezri is also 	amidst the engineers, watching them work.					LARKIN 			There it is... the only reason 			anyone gives a damn about this 			place. It's the largest Dominion 			communications array in the 			sector.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - ACT ONE   11C.14   CONTINUED:					SISKO 			If we can figure out how it 			works, we should be able to tap 			into their entire com system.					LARKIN 			One thing's for sure, they're 			determined to get it back.					SISKO			You can't let that happen.					LARKIN 			I know our orders, Captain. But 			maybe Starfleet Command isn't 			aware of our situation -- we've 			been holding this place for five 			months. That's five months of 			fighting off repeated Jem'Hadar 			attempts to take it back. When 			we landed here, there was a 			hundred and fifty of us... we're 			down to forty-three.					SISKO			I can appreciate what you've been 			through. I'll make sure that 			Starfleet understands your 			situation. But from what I hear, 			our forces are spread pretty thin 			in this system. Chances are, 			you're going to be stuck here a 			while longer.					LARKIN 			Lucky us.	Sisko is sympathetic, but there's not much he can 	do.15   ANGLE ON THE LOWER LEVEL	as Ezri moves to get a closer look at the array.					KELLIN 			Someone hand me a duonetic 			coupler.	Ezri, who's closest to him, picks up the tool and 	hands it to him.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - ACT ONE    12.15   CONTINUED:					KELLIN 			Thanks.					EZRI				(regarding something				on the array)			Your frequency discriminator			seems to be drifting. You might			want to reset it.	Kellin makes an adjustment to one of the panels.					KELLIN 			You an engineer?					EZRI 			No, but Tobin -- one of my 			previous hosts was.					KELLIN 			Close enough. Grab a microdyne 			coupler and start recalibrating 			that transtator.	Ezri then does as Kellin's asked.16   EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT	Nog is staring at Reese, who has returned to his post on the barricade.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - ACT ONE    13.17   ANOTHER ANGLE	as Quark approaches Nog. Quark can see that Nog is	both intrigued and spooked by Reese.					QUARK			Nog. Shouldn't you be helping			Doctor Bashir unload the			supplies?					NOG			We're pretty much finished.					QUARK			Good. The sooner we can get out			of here, the better.					NOG				(indicating Reese)			That soldier over there... you			see his necklace? Those are			Ketracel White tubes.					QUARK			So?					NOG			You know how he got them?					QUARK				(dry)			Mail order?					NOG			He took them off the bodies of			dead Jem'Hadar -- Jem'Hadar he			killed. It's his way of keeping			score.					QUARK			And you find that impressive?					NOG			Isn't it?					QUARK				(exasperated)			I don't think so. Take a look			around you, Nog.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - ACT ONE    14.17   CONTINUED:					QUARK (Cont'd)			This isn't the Starfleet you			know.					NOG				(defensive)			Sure it is. It's just that these			people have been through a lot.			They've been holed up here for a			long time... seen two thirds of			their unit killed... but they			haven't surrendered. And you			know why? Because they're			heroes.					QUARK			Maybe -- but I still don't want			you anywhere near them. Let me			tell you something about Hew-			mons, Nog. They're a wonderful,			friendly people -- as long as			their bellies are full and their			holosuites are working. But take			away their creature comforts...			deprive them of food, sleep,			sonic showers... put their lives			in jeopardy over an extended			period of time... and those same			friendly, intelligent, wonderful			people will become as nasty and			violent as the most bloodthirsty			Klingon. You don't believe me?			Just look at those faces... look			in their eyes.	Nog glances around the compound --18   NOG'S POV	of the soldiers, at their posts, waiting. They all	have the look Quark just described.19   RESUME					QUARK			You know I'm right, don't you?	But Nog doesn't answer.					QUARK			Well? Aren't you going to say			something?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Siege of AR-558" - REV. 10/13/98 - ACT ONE    15.19   CONTINUED:					NOG			I feel sorry for the Jem'Hadar.	And with that, Nog walks off, leaving a frustrated	and concerned Quark.20   INT.
