CAPTAIN'S OFFICE	A grim SISKO listens to KIRA complete her report.					KIRA			... the Defiant searched the area 			for almost six hours, but we 			couldn't find any sign of survivors.					SISKO				(feeling the loss)			The Cortez was a fine ship.					KIRA				(sympathetic) 			You knew Captain Swofford a long time.					SISKO				(nodding) 			I introduced him to his wife.					KIRA			Patrolling the Cardassian border 			is getting more and more 			dangerous. You never know 			when you're going to run into a 			squadron of Jem'Hadar fighters.					SISKO			I guess we popped the champagne 			corks too soon.	Kira gives Sisko a puzzled look.					SISKO 			Everyone thought the war was over 			when we retook the station and 			pushed the Dominion back into 			Cardassian space.					KIRA			I never believed that... and neither 			did you.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER     1A.1    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			A lot of good that did the four 			hundred people on the Cortez.	Kira looks at Sisko for a beat, then realizing there's 	nothing more to say, she nods and heads for the door.1A   ANGLE ON THE DOOR	as Kira leaves, she passes JOSEPH SISKO ENTERING.					KIRA				(smiling) 			Mister Sisko. So, how do you like 			our station so far?					JOSEPH			It certainly is big.	Kira nods acknowledgement then EXITS as Joseph turns 	his attention to his son.					JOSEPH 			I heard about Quentin Swofford. 			I'm sorry.					SISKO				(nods) 			Look, Dad... I know I haven't been 			very good company the last few days.					JOSEPH 			I didn't come here to be entertained. 			I came to see you and Jake.					SISKO			You picked an interesting time to 			take your first trip away from Earth.					JOSEPH 			Well, I figured it was now or 			never. Besides, I've been worried 			about you. Last couple of times 			we've talked... it seemed like the 			weight of the entire Alpha 			Quadrant was on your shoulders.					SISKO			Sometimes it feels that way.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER      2.1A   CONTINUED:	There's something Sisko wants to say that he's having 	difficulty articulating.					SISKO			Dad... I'm not sure...					JOSEPH 			Just say it, son.					SISKO			I just don't know how many friends 			I can lose. Every time I think 			I've achieved a real victory... 			something like this happens and it 			all turns to ashes.					JOSEPH			So what do you want to do?					SISKO 			Maybe it's time for me to step 			down... let someone else make the 			tough calls.					JOSEPH 			I see.				(a beat) 			Well, no one's indispensable, son. 			Not even you.				(a beat) 			Whatever decision you make, I'll 			support it.				(a beat) 			Of course, if Quentin Swofford was 			here... I'd bet he'd have a few 			things to say to you.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER      3.1A   CONTINUED:	(2)					SISKO			But he's not here... is he?			That's the whole point.	This moment hangs in the air for a beat.					JOSEPH 			I'd say you have some thinking to 			do... and I've got a dinner date 			with my grandson, so I'll let you 			get to it.	Just then, something off screen catches Sisko's eye --2    SISKO'S POV	outside his office, a MAN dressed in a gray flannel 	suit, circa 1953, passes by his door. (This is Odo, 	sans make-up, dressed in the clothes he will be wearing 	later as Pabst).3    ON SISKO	puzzled at the odd image.					SISKO 			Who was that?	But Joseph's back was to the door. Sisko walks out of 	his office to get a better look.4    INT. OPS - CONTINUOUS	DAX and Kira man their stations; SUPERNUMERARIES as 	needed. Sisko glances around Ops, but there's no sign 	of the man in the gray flannel suit. Joseph comes up 	behind him.					SISKO 			Where'd he go?					JOSEPH 			Who?					SISKO 			The man who just walked by my door.	Dax and Kira don't know what he's talking about.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER      4.4    CONTINUED:						DAX			I didn't see anyone.					SISKO				(puzzled)			I could've sworn...	And off that moment of Sisko's puzzlement, we go to --5    INT. CORRIDOR	Sisko and KASIDY YATES are walking down the corridor 	together.					KASIDY			I don't know what you're so 			worried about, Ben. I'm not 			taking my ship anywhere near the 			Cardassian border.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER      5.5    CONTINUED:					SISKO 			I realize that. But the Dominion 			is getting bolder and bolder... 			and your freighter is no match for 			a Jem'Hadar attack ship.					KASIDY 			They'd have to catch me first.					SISKO			You're really not worried, are you?					KASIDY 			Me? I'm fearless. You know 			that -- that's why you love me.					SISKO			I think I follow that logic.	Then something off screen catches Sisko's attention --6    ANOTHER ANGLE	to see WILLIE HAWKINS (Worf without his makeup), 	dressed in a New York Giants baseball outfit, circa 	1953.					WILLIE 				(to Sisko) 			Hey, Benny. See the game last 			night?	Willie passes by Sisko and Kasidy -- though Kasidy 	doesn't seem aware of his presence.					SISKO 			What?	Willie continues walking down the corridor, 	disappearing into some quarters.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER      6.7    ON SISKO	standing by Kasidy, a little dumbfounded.					KASIDY			Ben?					SISKO			Who was that?					KASIDY			Who was who?	Sisko looks at Kasidy, sees she's telling the truth. 	There's something very wrong here and Sisko's 	determined to get to the bottom of it.	Sisko hurries over to door where the ballplayer 	disappeared.					KASIDY				(calling after him)			Ben -- where are you going?	But Sisko's attention is on the door. He keys in the 	override code on the door panel and the door OPENS to 	reveal --8    EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY	It's a mid-town Manhattan street, circa 1953. CARS, 	TAXIS, PEDESTRIANS -- predominantly caucasian.9    ON SISKO	as he takes a step INTO the strange surroundings trying 	to grasp what he sees.10   WIDER	Sisko is standing in the middle of the street, still 	trying to make sense of what he sees. Is this a back 	door to a holosuite? But before he can figure out 	what's going on, a HORN BLASTS as a taxicab comes 	SCREECHING toward him. Sisko jumps out of the way, but 	the cab clips him, knocking him to the ground.	People rush all around him, as Sisko lies in the middle 	of the street.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER     6A.10A  SISKO'S POV	of the onlookers staring down at him, their faces 	obscured by the overhead sun.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER      7.10A  CONTINUED:					KASIDY'S VOICE			Ben -- what's wrong? Are you hurt?11   OMITTED12   INT. INFIRMARY	CLOSE ON Sisko as he opens his eyes to find himself on 	a biobed. BASHIR is near him, examining him with a 	[MED TECH] tool. JAKE, Joseph and Kasidy are standing 	nearby.					KASIDY 			He's awake.				(to Sisko) 			Ben, are you all right?					SISKO				(getting his bearings)			I think so...					JOSEPH 			Thank God.					JAKE 			Hey, Dad. You scared us there for 			a minute.	Sisko sits up.					SISKO 			What happened?					BASHIR 			I'm not sure. I'm reading some 			unusual synaptic potentials.				(to Sisko) 			The neural patterns are similar 			to those you experienced last year.					SISKO			You mean when I was having 			those... visions about Bajor?					JOSEPH 			Visions? Does this have something 			to do with those Prophets you're 			always telling me about?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER     7A.12   CONTINUED:					SISKO			Could be.					KASIDY				(concerned, to Bashir) 			He's not going to need surgery 			again, is he?      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - TEASER      8.12   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR 			I don't know yet. 				(to Sisko) 			But I'd like you to remain 			overnight for observation.					SISKO			Are you sure that's necessary?					BASHIR			Absolutely. Take a look at these 			readings --	Bashir hands a PADD to Sisko. Sisko looks down at it --13   SISKO'S POV	to see the PADD has become: Galaxy, a fifties sci-fi 	pulp magazine.					VENDOR (O.S.) 			You gonna buy that or not?	PULL BACK to REVEAL Sisko -- or rather, BENNY RUSSELL, 	as he will now be known -- standing by a newsstand in 	the same New York street we saw before. But this time, 	Benny is wearing a suit appropriate to the era. (Note: 	Benny is a separate individual from Ben Sisko. He has 	none of his thoughts, memories, or attitudes. He's a 	black man in early fifties America.)	The newsstand VENDOR is a tough, street-smart New 	Yorker (Nog without his makeup).					VENDOR 			Personally, I don't see the 			attraction. Spaceships, flying 			saucers, men from Mars...					BENNY 			What's wrong with men from Mars?					VENDOR 			Nothing, except it's all make-			believe. Me -- I like war stories. 			Did you see From Here to 			Eternity? Burt Lancaster standing 			there, in the middle of Pearl 			Harbor... machine gun blazing...       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond...

If 			it had been flying saucers... 			forget about it.				(re: the magazine) 			So you gonna buy that or not?	Benny searches his pockets for some change.					ALBERT (O.S.) 			Benny.14   NEW ANGLE	on ALBERT MACKLIN (O'Brien), an ex-mechanical engineer 	turned sci-fi writer. Macklin is an extremely 	intelligent but diffident fellow, who never seems to 	be able to finish a sentence. A pipe smoker, he's 	constantly patting down his pockets for the ever-	elusive book of matches.					BENNY 			Hello, Albert.					ALBERT				(patting his pockets) 			I thought... that is if you're on 			the way to the office...					BENNY				(finishing the sentence)			... we could walk there together?					ALBERT 			Exactly.	Benny hands Albert a pack of matches.					ALBERT 			Ah, there they are.	And as they walk off together, we PULL BACK WIDE to see 	the bustling city street, and:									FADE OUT.END OF TEASER     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond...

NEW YORK STREET - DAY (STOCK)	Establishing.16   INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE	The brain center of Incredible Tales -- a fairly 	successful science fiction magazine of the time. The 	walls are lined with blown-up covers of past issues. 	A series of small cubbyhole offices line the room, with 	a larger, glass-enclosed office in the back. This 	belongs to the magazine's editor, Douglas Pabst. In 	the center of the room is a round table where the 	writers gather, get their assignments and basically 	shoot the breeze. At the moment, there are three 	people at the table:	JULIUS and KAY EATON (Bashir and Kira without her 	Bajoran nose and earring), a husband and wife writing 	team, are seated drinking coffee. Julius is a refined, 	elegantly dressed Englishman wearing an ascot, a 	cigarette holder clutched in his hand. His wife, Kay, 	sits perched on a table. She's a no-nonsense 	attractive woman, with a cutting sense of humor.	Also present is HERBERT ROSSOFF (Quark without makeup), 	as opinionated and feisty a gent that ever set pen to 	paper. He's also the best writer of the group and he 	knows it.	CLOSE ON Julius and Kay at the table. Kay is carefully 	spooning in two tablespoons of a granulated mixture 	into a glass pitcher of water. She stirs the mixture 	and the water turns a tannish brown.					KAY 			Voila. A pitcher of plain water 			instantly becomes a pitcher of ice 			tea.					JULIUS 				(impressed) 			Incredible.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - ACT ONE     11.16   CONTINUED:	Julius picks up the jar of granulated tea powder and 	studies the label.					JULIUS				(reading) 			White Rose Redi-Tea. What an 			appalling concept.					KAY 			I bet H. G. Wells would've liked 			it.					JULIUS 			I doubt that. No self-respecting 			Englishman would.					HERBERT (O.S.) 			Pabst!17   NEW ANGLE	to find Herbert standing by the table, having just 	bitten into a doughnut, taken from a box on the table.					HERBERT 			Pabst! Get out here.	The door to the glass office opens and DOUGLAS PABST 	(Odo without makeup) comes storming in.					PABST 			What's wrong now, Herb?					HERBERT				(holding up a doughnut) 			I'll give you one guess.					KAY 			The battle of the doughnuts, round 			twenty-eight.					PABST				(irked) 			That's what you called me out here 			for -- to complain about the 			doughnuts?					HERBERT 			They're stale again.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - ACT ONE    11A.17   CONTINUED:	Thrusting the box at Pabst's chest. Pabst takes a 	doughnut and bites into it.					PABST 			Delicious.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond...

I'm going over 			to Galaxy.					PABST 			That rag?18   ANGLE ON THE DOOR	as Benny and Albert ENTER and make their way to the 	round table.					HERBERT 			I bet that rag knows the 			difference between a doughnut and 			a doorstop.		PABST						BENNY	You want to write				(to Kay and Julius)	Galaxy, go ahead.

Time to hand out 			next month's story assignments.				(booming out) 			Ritterhouse! We're waiting.					ROY (O.S.) 			Coming.	From out of the back emerges ROY RITTERHOUSE (think 	Martok without the makeup), carrying a folder of pencil 	sketches. Roy is an upbeat illustrator who enjoys his 	work.					ROY 			All right, friends and neighbors, 			let's see what Uncle Roy brought 			you today...	Roy holds up the first sketch -- it's a drawing of a little girl 	standing in the woods near a picnic table, staring at two aliens 	in space suits.					PABST 			I've titled this one... "Please, 			Take Me With You."				(to the group) 			Who wants this one?					JULIUS				(getting a nod from his 				wife) 			I think we can do something with 			that.					HERBERT				(caustic) 			I bet you can.

I had extra			sauerkraut on my franks that night.					HERBERT			Be that as it may, it's still the			worst piece of garbage I've ever seen.				(a beat)			I'll take it.					JULIUS			Of course you will. You've an			affinity for garbage, don't you?					HERBERT			The picture may be garbage, but the			story... the story will be art.	Herbert studies the drawing, his mind already beginning 	to weave a tale.19   ON BENNY AND ALBERT	who are rummaging through the remainder of Roy's 	illustrations. One of them in particular catches 	Benny's attention.20   ANGLE ON THE DRAWING	it's of a space station -- one that looks quite 	suggestive of the Deep Space Nine we know.21   ON BENNY	as he examines the drawing.					PABST				(re: the drawing)			I don't have a title for it yet...					BENNY			I'll think of something.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Far Beyond... " - REV. 12/10/97 - ACT ONE     16.21   CONTINUED:	And as Benny continues to study the illustration --					PABST 			Next order of business, some of 			our readers have been writing in 			wanting to know what you people 			look like.					KAY 			Write back and tell them we look 			like writers. Poor, needy and 			incredibly attractive.					PABST 			The publisher has come up with a 			better idea. Mister Stone has 			decided to run a picture of you 			in next month's issue.					ALBERT 			Is this really...					PABST			... necessary? I'm afraid so.	Pabst turns to Kay.					PABST 			Kay... you can sleep late that day.					KAY 				(biting) 			Of course I can. God forbid that			the public ever finds out K.C. 			Hunter is a woman.	An uncomfortable Pabst then turns his attention to 	Benny.					BENNY 			I suppose I'm sleeping late that 			day, too.					PABST 			It's not personal, Benny.

BENNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT	It's late. Benny, still wearing his street clothes, 	is asleep at the typewriter. Papers are scattered all 	about the table. A woman's hand CLICKS ON the radio 	which begins playing some soft, easy jazz. After a 	beat, the woman's hand comes to rest on his shoulder 	and begins rubbing his back, waking him gently.					CASSIE 			Hey, baby.
