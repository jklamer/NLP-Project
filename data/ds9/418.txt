She's angry but she's keeping 	her emotions under control.					KIRA			Commander, I just received word that 			a Valerian transport has requested 			permission to dock here at the 			station.					SISKO				(a sympathetic smile)			Let me guess.  You're here to 			recommend we deny their request.					KIRA			The Valerians ran weapons-grade 			dolamide to Cardassian forces during 			the occupation of Bajor.					SISKO			I'm aware of that...					KIRA			I believe they're continuing to ship 			weapons to the Cardassians... weapons 			that could eventually be used to 			attack Bajor.					SISKO			I share your concern, Major.  But 			unless we have proof to back up those 			charges...       DEEP SPACE: "Dramatis Personae" - REV. 3/18/93 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					KIRA			The proof is on the ship.  Let me 			conduct a search and if I find any 			dolamide, we can confiscate it.					SISKO			I'm afraid it's not that simple.  			Dolamide is used for power generators, 			reactors, in short-range transports...					KIRA			And for weapons.					SISKO			Only if it's extremely pure.	Kira sighs in exasperation.					KIRA			So we're going to do nothing.					SISKO			I didn't say that.  But we can't 			just board their ship and start 			tearing it apart.					KIRA			Then what can we do?					SISKO			You bring me evidence that the 			Valerians are dealing in weapons-			grade dolamide and I promise you the 			Federation will use every kind of 			diplomatic pressure to stop them.	Kira considers for a beat.					KIRA			You think that'll work?					SISKO				(smiling)			It will if the Valerians want to 			keep trading with the Federation.	Kira nods.       DEEP SPACE: "Dramatis Personae" - REV. 3/17/93 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED:	(2)					KIRA				(still not totally 				convinced)			All right, we'll try it your way.					SISKO			Good.  Then you'll see to it that 			the Valerian ship is cleared for 			docking.					KIRA				(still doesn't relish 				the thought)			Yes, sir.	She EXITS.  Sisko goes back to work, satisfied he's done the 	correct thing.3    INT. OPS - CONTINUOUS	Kira continues into Ops.  DAX is at her post; BASHIR is 	working at a console; several Supernumeraries go about their 	business.					DAX			Chief, I have a subspace message for 			you from your wife.

The station is rocked 	by a shockwave.  OFF reactions --					O'BRIEN			I'm reading a transporter signal.  			Someone must have beamed off the 			ship just as it exploded.7    IN FRONT OF THE OPS TABLE (OPTICAL)	A KLINGON OFFICER begins to MATERIALIZE -- but is unable to 	solidify and remains frozen in a Transporter state.

Try boosting the annular 			containment field.					O'BRIEN			I'm already there...	The figure of the Klingon starts to solidify... O'Brien keeps 	working the controls and the Klingon fully MATERIALIZES -- 	collapses against the Ops table.	Bashir is the first to his side -- running his tricorder 	over the alien's battered and scorched body.					BASHIR			He's been hit by weapons fire.  It's 			severe.  We've got to get him into 			cryo-stasis.	The Klingon suddenly pushes himself away from the table, 	stares around the room with a wild, toothy grin.					KLINGON			Victory...	He shudders and his eyes close, his hand slipping off of 	Bashir.  The doctor takes a reading from the tricorder, then 	looks up.					BASHIR			He's dead.	OFF the reactions.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                DEEP SPACE: "Dramatis Personae" - REV. 3/17/93 - ACT ONE       6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE:  Episode credits fall over opening scenes)8    EXT.

We 			have identified the dead Klingon -- 			his name was Hon-Tihl, First Officer 			of the Toh'Kaht.  Why he died, and 			the cause of his ship's destruction, 			is still unknown.9    INT. OPS	Bashir and Dax are briefing Sisko, Kira, O'Brien and Odo.					BASHIR			I found tritanium alloy fragments in 			his chest and upper arms.  If that 			was all, we could have saved him.  			But those weapon burns were too 			severe.					SISKO			Is there any way to identify the 			kind of weapon used?					BASHIR				(nodding)			I'm running a microtissue analysis 			right now.  We should have the results 			in a couple of hours.					KIRA			The Klingon said "victory" before he 			died.

Sisko turns to Dax and O'Brien.					SISKO				(continuing)			I'd like the two of you to take a 			Runabout and try to find the 			Toh'Kaht's mission recorder.  I want 			to know what caused that ship to 			explode.					O'BRIEN			Aye, Sir.	Everyone stands... except for Dax who seems lost in thought, 	a small smile on her face as if she were laughing at some 	private joke.					O'BRIEN			Lieutenant...      DEEP SPACE: "Dramatis Personae" - REV. 3/18/93 - ACT ONE     8-9.9    CONTINUED:	(2)	Dax looks up, still smiling...					DAX			Yes...					O'BRIEN			You coming?	Dax gets up.					DAX			I'm sorry, I was... nevermind...	She accompanies O'Brien to the Turbolift.10   EXT.
