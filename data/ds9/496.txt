SPACE (OPTICAL)	The Defiant at warp.					SISKO (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 49904.2. 			After driving away Breen 			privateers from the Bajoran colony 			of Prophets' Haven, we are 			returning to Deep Space Nine. I 			think I speak for the whole crew 			when I say it'll be good to be home.2    INT. DEFIANT - MESS HALL	It's meal break for one of the shifts. O'BRIEN and DAX 	are eating at one of the tables (the one farthest 	from the door and closest to the replicators.) BASHIR 	is ordering at the replicator.					BASHIR 			Tarkalean tea and sweetened 			brescha fruit.	Bashir looks dead tired. It's been a long mission.3    ANGLE ON DAX AND O'BRIEN	overlapping with the above.					DAX				(to O'Brien)			When I was Leela Dax, I went 			through the same thing. Every 			night I'd tuck in my son Ahjess, 			and two hours later, he'd climb 			into bed with me. I don't think 			I slept through the night for 			weeks.					O'BRIEN			Weeks? Molly's been doing it for 			almost two months already.					DAX			She's just looking for a little 			attention.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - TEASER       2.3    CONTINUED:					BASHIR				(as he walks up)			I'd say she's jealous. She knows 			you and Keiko are going to have a 			new baby soon, and she's looking 			for attention.					O'BRIEN			What makes you such an expert on 			children?				BASHIR				(simply)			First in my class in pediatric 			medicine.	Bashir sits down in one of the open seats at the table. 	It's the "gunfighter's seat," the one up against the 	wall facing the door.					DAX				(to Bashir, fair 				warning)			I wouldn't sit there if I were 			you.					BASHIR 			Why? Did Miles spill something 			again?					O'BRIEN				(not amused)			That's Worf's seat. He's going to 			be here any minute.	Bashir's exhausted from the mission and doesn't really 	want to move.					BASHIR			Just because he lives on the 			Defiant full time, that doesn't			give him proprietary rights to the 			mess hall.					DAX			No one says it does. He just 			likes that chair.	Bashir stays seated. Just then WORF comes in and 	orders.					WORF			Prune juice. Extra large.       DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - TEASER        4    CLOSE ON WORF	Who takes his prune juice and walks over and stands 	looking down at Bashir expectantly. There's a beat as 	he glowers wordlessly at Bashir. Bashir finally looks 	up at him, then smiles and slides over to the other 	open chair.					BASHIR 				(cheery)			Have a seat, commander.					WORF			Thank you.	But before Worf can settle in, the ship goes to Red 	Alert.					SISKO'S COM VOICE			All senior staff report to the			bridge, immediately.	There's an urgency in Sisko's voice that puts everyone 	instantly on the go.5    INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE	SISKO is standing in front of his chair, looking at the 	viewscreen. He never takes his eyes off of it as the 	crew ENTERS.					SISKO			You'd better have a look at this.6    CLOSE ON O'BRIEN, WORF, DAX AND BASHIR	Their eyes grow wide as they look at the screen.7    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	To include the viewscreen with a familiar view of Deep 	Space Nine. Except this time it's clear something's very 	wrong. One of the upper pylons has been blown away.8    INT. HABITAT RING CORRIDOR	Whatever happened on Deep Space Nine, the immediate 	threat seems to be over, but the aftereffects are 	clear. The scene in the corridor is one of chaos. 	Though the corridor itself has been cordoned off by 	Bajoran deputies, we can see that the area has been 	damaged by some kind of explosion. The whole place is 	full of smoke and noise.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - TEASER       4.8    CONTINUED:	Bajoran firefighters rush down the hall. Medical 	personnel move in the opposite direction, extracting 	wounded from a damaged area.9    NEW ANGLE	On KIRA, who's directing the damage control operations	despite being wounded herself.					KIRA				(to firefighter)			Concentrate on the fires in 			Section Thirteen. We have to keep 			them away from the plasma conduits.	A worried QUARK runs up.					QUARK 			Has anyone seen my brother Rom? 			He told me he was going to be 			working in one of the Upper Pylons 			today.					KIRA			He's fine. I saw him with one of 			the damage control teams on Level 			Five.					QUARK 			What a relief.				(a beat)			Wait till I find him. I'll kill 			him for scaring me like that.	Quark EXITS. ODO emerges from the damaged area, 	carrying a PADD.					ODO 			Here's a preliminary list of the 			stolen equipment.	As Kira takes the list, Sisko, Dax and Bashir come 	rushing down the corridor.					SISKO 			Report, Major.	Bashir is already in action, beginning to triage the 	wounded. Everyone's talking at once. It's not 	important that we make out what everyone is saying. 	What is important is that we feel the frantic urgency 	that drives both conversations.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - TEASER      4A.9    CONTINUED:			KIRA						BASHIR	It was a Jem'Hadar strike 			(examining a downed man)	team.

The lights are low, reflecting the 	fact that the Defiant is cloaked.					SISKO			What do you see, Dax?					DAX				(off readouts)			Nothing good. Their ion trail is 			getting fainter. The Jem'Hadar 			must be emitting a magneton pulse 			to cover their tracks.					SISKO			Keep on them, Commander. I want 			that ship.					ODO			Frankly, I'm surprised that 			something like this hasn't 			happened sooner. Being at the 			edge of the wormhole makes Deep 			Space Nine a tempting target.					SISKO			Sometimes I wish we could have the 			Defiant standing guard over the 			station twenty-six hours a day.					WORF			Restricting the Defiant to guard 			duty would be a serious mistake.					O'BRIEN			You wouldn't say that if you had 			family living on the station.					WORF			Perhaps.

Omet'iklan places 	the case on Weyoun's table, then stands at attention 	himself.					OMET'IKLAN			It is time.					WEYOUN			It's time when I say it's time.	Weyoun keeps eating. The Jem'Hadar just stand there, 	looming over him. Weyoun sighs like this is a huge 	burden for him.					WEYOUN			Oh, very well.	Weyoun makes a show of finishing his food, wiping his	mouth, and folding his napkin. Weyoun places his hand 	on a scanner on the case.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT THREE    36.47   CONTINUED:					WEYOUN				(to the case)			Prepare seven vials. Unlock.	There's the sound of some kind of high-tech equipment 	operating. Then the case opens. Weyoun carefully 	removes seven vials of White, then seals the case. 	What follows is a ceremony, but Weyoun treats it with 	a bored casualness. It means nothing to him.					WEYOUN			First Omet'iklan, can you vouch 			for the loyalty of your men?					OMET'IKLAN			We pledge our loyalty to the 			Founders from now until death.	Omet'iklan takes this exchange very seriously. It's 	one of the things that defines his role in the 	universe.					WEYOUN				(by rote)			Then receive this reward from the 			Founders. May it keep you strong.	He casually holds out the vials. Omet'iklan takes them 	with grave seriousness, then goes down the line and 	gives one to each of his men, taking the last one himself.48   CLOSE ON THE JEM'HADAR	As they replace the canisters of White attached to the 	feed-lines in their necks. The Jem'Hadar immediately 	feel and look better, more energetic, more alive. The 	White clearly works as intended.					OMET'IKLAN			Resume your training.	Omet'iklan EXITS.49   NEW ANGLE	On O'Brien, Odo, Dax and Worf.					O'BRIEN			I guess that's one way to ensure 			loyalty.					WORF			Loyalty bought at such a price is 			no loyalty at all.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT THREE    37.49   CONTINUED:	Toman'torax comes up to their table. He singles out 	O'Brien.					TOMAN'TORAX			Human, come with me. It is time 			to resume our battle drills.					O'BRIEN			In a minute.					TOMAN'TORAX			I'm ready now.						O'BRIEN			Well, I'm not.	Toman'torax turns to another Jem'Hadar.					TOMAN'TORAX				(with contempt)			They stuff themselves with food			but have no appetite for battle.	Worf's had about enough of this guy's attitude.					WORF			When the time comes, you will find 			us more than ready.					TOMAN'TORAX			Ready to flee at the first sign of 			danger.				(to O'Brien)			Let's go. You can practice 			running away.	Toman'torax grabs O'Brien by the collar and yanks him 	to his feet. In a flash, Worf comes to O'Brien's 	defense, getting up out of his seat and punching Toman'torax.50   CLOSE ON TOMAN'TORAX	Who staggers back, letting go of O'Brien. He looks up 	at Worf and smiles.					TOMAN'TORAX			I've always wanted to kill a 			Klingon.	Toman'torax attacks Worf. They go over a table. One 	of the Jem'Hadar goes to assist, only to be smashed in 	the face by Dax. And within seconds, the fighting has 	become general.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT THREE    38.51   CLOSE ON WEYOUN	Who carefully avoids being involved in the fighting and 	heads for the door, where he meets...52   ANGLE ON THE DOOR	Sisko ENTERS the room and sees what's going on.					WEYOUN			Really, Captain. This is 			unacceptable.	Sisko immediately begins breaking up the combatants.					SISKO				(angry)			That's enough. The next person 			who throws a punch will have to 			answer to me.	Suddenly, Omet'iklan ENTERS and begins carving a wide 	path through his men, pulling them apart from their 	Federation antagonists.53   NEW ANGLE	As the dust settles.					SISKO			I want to know who started this.	Worf's not about to shirk blame.					WORF			I did.	Nor is Toman'torax going to let himself be shown up by 	a Klingon.					TOMAN'TORAX			And I.	Omet'iklan is furious.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT THREE    39.53   CONTINUED:					OMET'IKLAN			You again. You knew my orders.					TOMAN'TORAX			And I defied them. I deserve 			punishment.					OMET'IKLAN			And you will have it.	Without further warning, Omet'iklan reaches out, grabs 	Toman'torax by the throat, and snaps his neck. The 	Jem'Hadar falls to the floor.54   CLOSE ON SISKO	And the Federation soldiers as they react with shock at 	this harsh discipline.					OMET'IKLAN				(to Sisko, re: Worf)			what are you waiting for? Kill 			him and be done with it.	Sisko locks eyes with Omet'iklan, then turns to Worf.					SISKO			Mister Worf, when not on duty you 			are confined to quarters for the 			remainder of this mission.					WORF			Yes, sir.	Worf EXITS. Sisko looks at the crowd. He doesn't want 	them hanging around with all the bad blood in the air.					SISKO			All right, let's break this up. 			Either get back to your stations 			or go to your quarters. Either 			way, I want this room cleared. Now.	Everyone files out, but Omet'iklan, who looks down with 	sadness at the dead body of Toman'torax. Omet'iklan 	didn't like killing his officer, but felt he had no 	choice. The fact that Sisko didn't follow suit 	infuriates him.					OMET'IKLAN			You call that discipline?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT THREE   39A.54   CONTINUED:					SISKO			A dead man can't learn from his 			mistakes. And maybe I don't get 			the same joy out of killing that 			you do?					OMET'IKLAN			You think I enjoyed that? 			Toman'torax was my Second. 			He served under me for three years. 			I valued him.					SISKO			You have a funny way of showing it.					OMET'IKLAN			I did what had to be done, what 			any First would do. I placed the 			good of the unit above my personal 			feelings. A soldier who cannot 			follow orders is a danger to his 			unit. And must be eliminated.					SISKO			Mister Worf is not a danger to my 			command. But if I eliminated him 			for a simple breach of discipline, 			I would be. My men would stop 			trusting me. And I wouldn't blame 			them.	Omet'iklan stares at Sisko. In the end, he can only 	shake his head. Sisko's actions are completely foreign 	to him.					OMET'IKLAN			You are weak. You should die in 			his place.				(comes to a decision)			And when this mission is over, I 			will see that you do.	Omet'iklan turns and EXITS. Hold on Sisko for a beat, 	then...									FADE OUT.                       END OF ACT THREE                              DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/09/96 - ACT FOUR    A40.                           ACT FOUR                             	FADE IN:54A  INT. DEFIANT - CORRIDOR 	Odo is walking down the corridor when suddenly the door 	to a crew cabin opens and Weyoun steps out.					WEYOUN			Odo, may I speak to you for a 			moment?	Odo looks at the Vorta suspiciously.					ODO			A moment.	Weyoun studies Odo with interest and admiration.					WEYOUN			You know, I've been watching you.					ODO			I've noticed.					WEYOUN			I have to admit, I find it 			somewhat... disturbing. Seeing 			you working for these... 				(with distaste)			Federation people, letting them 			order you around. You're a 			Founder. You should be the one			giving the orders.

But before you do, 			please hear what I have to say.	Odo looks stonily at Weyoun, but lets him continue.					WEYOUN			Your people want you to come home, 			Odo.

Though he doesn't 	necessarily trust the Vorta, he wants what he's hearing 	to be true.					ODO			Maybe they do. But I don't love 			them.					WEYOUN				(gently)			You're lying. And you're not very 			good at it. I, on the other hand, 			am an expert on lies. Both in 			telling them, and in spotting 			them. So you may as well admit 			the truth. More than anything in 			your life, you want to return to 			your people.				(a beat)			And I can make it possible.					ODO			How?					WEYOUN			Let me worry about the "how." All 			I need to know is... Are you ready 			to go home?54C  ANGLE ON WEYOUN	For the Vorta, this is an important moment. He knows 	that Odo's answer will have significant consequences, 	both in his life and in Odo's.					ODO			No. But I am ready to end this 			conversation.	Weyoun looks at Odo for a beat, then gives him a good-	natured clap on the shoulder. (In case anyone's 	interested, when he touches Odo, Weyoun is purposely 	infecting Odo with the disease that almost kills him in 	"BROKEN LINK.")					WEYOUN			Then it's over. After all, you're 			a Founder. I live to serve you.	And with that, Weyoun steps back into his quarters.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/09/96 - ACT FOUR     40.54D  CLOSE ON ODO	As he looks at the closed door for a beat and then 	continues on his way.A55   INT.

"					DAX			She'd probably think it was sweet.					O'BRIEN			It would scare the hell out of 			her.				(looks at the isolinear				chip)			To be honest, it scares the hell			out of me.

DEFIANT - CORRIDOR - ARMS LOCKER	Close on O'Brien as he hands out phaser rifles to the 	Starfleet officers. (Dax and Worf aren't present, 	having already armed themselves. Odo's not there 	either. He doesn't use guns.) After the last Starfleet 	officer has been given a rifle, the Jem'Hadar line up 	to receive their weapons. Omet'iklan holds out his 	hand to receive a rifle. O'Brien hesitates.					OMET'IKLAN			I'm waiting.	O'Brien looks over to Sisko, who stands nearby with 	Weyoun. Sisko nods, silently telling O'Brien to go 	ahead with it. O'Brien reluctantly gives Omet'iklan 	a rifle. Omet'iklan passes it back and it works its way 	down the line. O'Brien continues passing out rifles 	until all the Jem'Hadar are armed.	Virak'kara examines his rifle.					O'BRIEN			Don't worry. These aren't like 			the ones we gave you during the 			drill. They're fully charged.					VIRAK'KARA				(to Omet'iklan)			This weapon is set on stun.					OMET'IKLAN				(to his men)			Deactivate safeties.

ICONIAN ZIGGURAT ENTRANCE - DAY	Four visible Jem'Hadar soldiers guard the entrance, 	which means there're probably two more camouflaged ones 	hanging around. These renegade Jem'Hadar have probably 	done something to either their hair or their wardrobe 	that will distinguish them from Omet'iklan's men. And 	instead of Jem'Hadar rifles, they carry alien-looking 	polearms, something like a cross between the halberds 	used by British beefeaters and Japanese naginatas.61   EXT. WOODED AREA - DAY	This is a heavily wooded area. There are traces of the 	ancient Iconian city scattered among the trees, a 	column here and a bit of a wall there. Sisko takes 	cover behind a tree. O'Brien is nearby. He's carrying 	a satchel. In the background, three Jem'Hadar and 	three Starfleet personnel move forward through the 	brush. Worf and Odo are among the new arrivals.	Sisko signals to the new arrivals with hand gestures. 	They break into two three-man teams and take up positions.62   CLOSE ON FIRST OMET'IKLAN	As he examines his phaser rifle. He looks puzzled. He 	sights the rifle into the forest and pulls the trigger. 	Nothing happens. He's furious. Omet'iklan examines 	the rifle of another Jem'Hadar, throws it to the 	ground, and storms over to Sisko and O'Brien.					OMET'IKLAN			You betrayed us.					SISKO			What are you talking about?					OMET'IKLAN			Our rifles have been sabotaged.	He shoves the rifle at Sisko. As Sisko examines it, 	O'Brien looks at his own rifle.					O'BRIEN			Hold on.	He tries to fire his rifle.

He smiles 	grimly.					OMET'IKLAN			The way is clear.					SISKO			Let's move.77   INT. GATEWAY CHAMBER - DAY (OPTICAL)	The Gateway is a high-tech metallic archway with a 	flashing energy field inside. It's similar to the tech 	from TNG's "Contagion." Images of other worlds flash in 	the Gateway. Two Jem'Hadar sentries stand guard.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT FIVE     50.78   NEW ANGLE	Suddenly Omet'iklan and Sisko rush in to attack. 	Omet'iklan takes on one of the guards. Sisko rushes 	the other one as O'Brien goes to place the explosives. 	After a difficult struggle, both Sisko and Omet'iklan 	emerge victorious.79   CLOSE ON SISKO (OPTICAL)	As soon as he defeats his opponent, Sisko starts 	looking around the room making sure there're no 	camouflaged opponents left. Omet'iklan does likewise. 	Suddenly Sisko catches a glimpse of something out of 	the corner of his eye. Sisko jumps between Omet'iklan 	and the shimmer, taking a weapon slash from an enemy 	Jem'Hadar just as he appears. This alerts Omet'iklan, 	who cuts down the renegade.80   NEW ANGLE	As Omet'iklan looks at the downed sentry and realizes 	Sisko has saved his life.					OMET'IKLAN				(surprised)			I threatened to kill you, but you 			were still willing to sacrifice 			yourself to save my life.	Sisko presses a hand into his injured side to stop the bleeding.					SISKO			Looks that way.					OMET'IKLAN			Why?					SISKO			If you have to ask, you'll never 			understand.	O'Brien's finished planting the explosives.					O'BRIEN			Gentlemen, it's time we were 			leaving.	The three of them EXIT.81   INT. ZIGGURAT VESTIBULE - DAY	Virak'kara and Dax are still fighting against a handful 	of Jem'Hadar sentries. Suddenly Odo and Worf come 	charging out of a passageway. Worf is carrying the 	wounded Starfleet Security Officer over his shoulders.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT FIVE     51.81   CONTINUED:					ODO			Let's go, Dax.	Dax and Virak'kara push back from their opponents.					DAX				(to a renegade)			If I were you, I'd run like hell.	Dax, Virak'kara, Worf and Odo retreat and head out the 	door.82   EXT. WOODED AREA - DAY	Sisko, O'Brien and Omet'iklan are there. One Jem'Hadar 	and two Starfleet Security Officers are waiting for 	them.					SISKO			What about Dax and the others?	Dax, Worf, Odo and Virak'kara emerge from the 	darkness.					WORF			Right here, Captain.	Just then, there's a huge explosion in the distance 	that shakes the ground.					O'BRIEN			So much for the Gateway.					ODO			It looks like we got out just in			time.	Virak'kara immediately checks his rifle.					VIRAK'KARA			Our weapons are working again.	Omet'iklan immediately grabs a rifle. So does just 	about everyone else. It looks like there's going to be 	a fight. Sisko waits for the Jem'Hadar to make the 	first move.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT FIVE     52.83   CLOSE ON OMET'IKLAN	Who looks a Sisko, but before we find out what he's	going to do...84   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Weyoun beams in, along with two more Starfleet 	officers. He's got his case of white with him. Sisko 	and the others react to his sudden appearance.					WEYOUN			The Defiant's sensors registered 			a powerful explosion in the 			vicinity of the Gateway. I assume 			your mission was a success?	Omet'iklan looks coldly at Weyoun.					DAX			The Gateway's been destroyed, if 			that's what you mean.					WEYOUN			Well done, Captain.				(looks at Omet'iklan)			You've all done very nicely. 			Extra rations of White for 			everyone. Now if you don't mind, 			I'd like to inspect the wreckage.	But before Weyoun can finish his sentence...85   CLOSE ON OMET'IKLAN (OPTICAL)	Omet'iklan opens fire, disintegrating the Vorta. Sisko 	and the others react.					OMET'IKLAN			That's for questioning our 			loyalty.86   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Omet'iklan turns toward Sisko, but keeps his gun down. 	Everyone tenses, expecting trouble, but they all wait 	to see what Sisko and Omet'iklan do. There's a long 	beat as Omet'iklan stares at Sisko, utterly 	unreadable. Maybe it's respect, maybe it's some kind 	of gratitude, but in the end, Omet'iklan gives Sisko 	the smallest of smiles.					OMET'IKLAN			I think there's been enough 			killing for one day.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT FIVE     53.86   CONTINUED:	Sisko realizes that Omet'iklan isn't going to carry out 	his threat.					VIRA-KIKARA				(collecting the case)			The Vorta will have no further use 			of this.					SISKO			We can take you to the nearest 			Dominion outpost.					OMET'IKLAN			My men and I will remain here. 			There're still disloyal Jem'Hadar 			on this planet. They must be 			hunted down and eliminated.					SISKO			Good luck.	Omet'iklan doesn't wish Sisko the same. Omet'iklan 	studies Sisko, amazed that the human can continue to 	surprise him. The two commanders lock eyes for a beat, 	then Omet'iklan shakes his head.					OMET'IKLAN			You fought well. But the next time 			we meet, we'll be enemies.					SISKO			I'll keep that in mind.	Omet'iklan turns and walks away and he and his men	shimmer into invisibility.87   CLOSE ON SISKO AND HIS CREW	As they watch the Jem'Hadar disappear. No one's eager 	to see them again. Sisko looks at his crew. They're 	bloodied, battered, but unbowed. A moment passes 	between the captain and his crew. He's proud of them, 	and they know it.					O'BRIEN			I don't know about the rest of you, 			but I'd like to get out of here.	Sisko nods. He hits his combadge.					SISKO				(to com)			Sisko to Defiant. Begin 			transport.									CUT TO:     DEEP SPACE NINE: "To the Death" - REV. 04/01/96 - ACT FIVE     54.87A  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	The Defiant in orbit. Hold on this for a beat, then...									FADE OUT.                          END OF ACT FIVE                                                        THE END                               STXT  
