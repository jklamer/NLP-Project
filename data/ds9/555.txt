Bashir is beginning to think Patrick 	was wrong about Sarina, until a single TEAR spills 	from her eye and falls down her cheek.					BASHIR				(needing to hear it)			Sarina, do you love me... ?       DEEP SPACE NINE: "Chrysalis" - REV. 09/16/98 - ACT FIVE      63.E54B CONTINUED:	He strokes her face, and his touch breaks through to 	her -- she chokes back a sob, tries to understand 	the emotions welling up inside her.					SARINA 			I don't know...	This knocks the wind from Bashir's lungs... he 	listens, stricken.					SARINA				(anguished) 			I don't even understand what 			love is...	Sarina doesn't understand what she's feeling and it 	scares her.					SARINA 			I don't understand anything...	Bashir sees the depth of her confusion, senses the 	panic rising inside her -- pushing aside his own 	feelings, he moves to comfort her.					BASHIR 			Sarina...					SARINA				(pleading with him) 			What am I supposed to do... what 			am I supposed to feel... ? Tell 			me. I want to make you happy. I 			owe you everything.	Her words pierce his heart -- the terrible 	realization comes over him that he's pulled Sarina 	into his fantasy, not realizing that she's going 	along with it because she doesn't know what else to 	do, because she feels she owes it to him.					BASHIR				(holding her close) 			No... you don't owe me 			anything...					SARINA				(hating herself for 				her failure) 			I'm sorry...
