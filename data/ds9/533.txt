SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Establishing.2    INT. CARGO BAY/TEAM DORM	The Cargo Bay has been configured into a kind of 	dormitory. Free-standing partitions divide the room 	into semi-private areas. There's a REPLICATOR against 	one wall, several WALL MONITORS, and a large TABLE and 	CHAIRS in the middle of the room. Alcoves in the 	corners offer separate sleeping quarters.	We cut in to find an agitated man of about thirty-five, 	pacing back and forth and ranting half to himself. 	He's JACK, and as we'll learn, he's a maladjusted 	product of twenty-fourth century genetic engineering.	Behind him, we see a beautiful woman of about the same 	age, luxuriating on a nearby couch. Her name is 	LAUREN, and everything she does exudes a strange 	sensuality. She's watching Jack with an elaborately 	patient air.					JACK			No. No. It's not fair.				(more to himself)			Am I alone here? Is that it? Am			I the only one who sees.				(covering his ears)			What is that noise!	A voice from off-camera replies --					LOEWS (O.S.)			Calm down.3    NEW ANGLE	to include DOCTOR LOEWS, a Starfleet psychiatrist of 	about thirty-five. Though by nature a warm person, 	she's been working with Jack and the others for months 	now and it's been a difficult time.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - TEASER      2.3    CONTINUED:	Somewhere behind her we see SARINA, a ghost-like 	apparition in her late twenties. Pale and drawn, she 	never speaks. She always seems to be hovering on the 	edge of things -- we never see her move, she just seems 	to appear in places.					JACK 			Why? Am I talking too fast? 			Having trouble keeping up, Doctor?					LOEWS 			I just don't want you to get 			upset.	PATRICK, a child-like man in his fifties, ambles up to 	Doctor Loews. He looks scared, lost --					PATRICK 			Please don't leave us here, Karen. 			Please.					LOEWS				(reassuring) 			It's only for a few weeks, 			Patrick.	Jack can't resist taunting Patrick --					JACK 			You know what they're going to do 			to us, don't you? You know why 			they carted us halfway across the 			quadrant? They're going to 			experiment on us.					LOEWS 			Stop it, Jack.	Patrick starts to fight back tears --					JACK 			They want to find out what makes 			our "genetically engineered" 			brains tick. They're going to cut 			our heads open and see what comes 			out!	He spins away with manic glee, delighted to have upset 	Patrick.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical...

I told you 			why I brought you here, remember? 			To meet that Doctor? Doctor 			Bashir?					LAUREN 			You know. The handsome one.					LOEWS				(to Patrick) 			He was genetically enhanced when 			he was a boy, just like all of you.					JACK 			No. No. He's not like us. I 			never saw him at the Institute. 			He wasn't locked away for being 			too smart. He passed himself off 			as normal. He's mister normal 			Starfleet man. Mister productive 			member of society. Maybe we can 			learn to be just like him. Wear 			a little uniform.				(saluting) 			Yes, sir.				(pivoting around) 			No, sir.				(pivoting again) 			Thank you, sir.					PATRICK 			I don't like it here.					LOEWS 			It's going to be all right. 			Doctor Bashir is going to work 			with you for a while, that's all. 			Think of it as a little vacation 			from the Institute.					JACK				(to himself) 			No. No. This isn't happening.					LOEWS 			It is happening, Jack, and you're 			going to have to try to make the 			best of it.	Lauren crosses over, holding a PADD in her hand and 	looking at it longingly --					LAUREN 			I'm going to make the best of it.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - TEASER      4.3    CONTINUED:	(3)	She holds up the PADD, which displays a PICTURE of 	Bashir.					LAUREN 			See the way he's looking at me? 			He's in love with me already.					JACK				(grabbing for PADD) 			Give me that.	But Lauren's too fast for him, whips it out of his 	reach. Patrick starts to whimper again --					PATRICK 			I want to go home.	The door CHIMES. Lauren spins to face the door --					LAUREN				(excited) 			It's him.	Jack uses the opportunity to snatch the PADD away -- he 	immediately smashes it against a nearby table, 	shattering the screen. He holds it up to taunt Lauren, 	and we see spidery cracks across Bashir's face.					JACK 			See that? That's what I'm going 			to do to your boyfriend.					LOEWS				(holding out her hand) 			Give me the PADD.	He refuses for a defiant beat, then suddenly slaps the 	PADD into her open palm, broken screen first. She 	yanks her hand away, and we see that she's been cut. 	Jack tries to hide his smile.					JACK 			Sorry.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - TEASER      5.3    CONTINUED:	(4)	She checks herself, recovers her professional bearing, 	and starts to wrap a makeshift bandage around her hand.					LOEWS 			You're not sorry, Jack. We both 			know that. You did it on purpose 			because you're upset. But there 			are better ways of dealing with 			being upset.					JACK 			I'll work on it.	Loews turns to the others --					LOEWS 			All right, I'll see you all in a 			few weeks.	She makes an extra effort to say good-bye to the 	introverted Sarina.					LOEWS 			Bye, Sarina.	Before she leaves, Patrick moves to her and gives her 	a big hug. She accepts it, and with a last look at 	Jack, Loews heads for the door.4    INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR	where we find BASHIR waiting patiently. It's hard to 	tell if he's anticipating going in or dreading it -- 	the truth is it's a little of both. The prospect of 	meeting others who were genetically engineered brings 	up painful memories, memories he hasn't fully dealt 	with.	The door OPENS to admit Loews. As it shuts behind her, 	Bashir sees the blood on the bandage wrapped around her 	hand.					BASHIR 			Are you all right?     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - TEASER      6.4    CONTINUED:					LOEWS 			It's nothing. Just another run-in 			with Jack. Like I said in my 			report, don't turn your back on 			him.					BASHIR 			We'd better get you down to the 			Infirmary.					LOWES 			I'll be fine. You go on in. 			They're about as ready to meet you 			as they'll ever be. 				(beat) 			I just hope you have better luck 			getting through to them than I've 			had.	And with that, she moves past him and heads down the 	corridor. Off Bashir's face as he prepares to enter 	the door and face whatever's on the other side...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical...

Any relation?					BASHIR				(surprised) 			Yes, actually.	(NOTE: In the background, we might occasionally notice 	Sarina stealing surreptitious glances Jack's way. She 	enjoys his shenanigans, fears his temper, and most of 	all, wishes he'd pay attention to her.)					JACK 			His work was totally derivative. 			He was a plagiarist. You knew 			that -- you had to know. But you 			came in here bragging about it 			anyway. Why?	From behind a partition, Patrick giggles.					BASHIR 			You're the one who brought it up.					JACK			What was I supposed to do -- let			you get away with it?				(clutching his ears) 			That noise!     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical...

But 			they had my hand-eye coordination, 			reflexes and vision improved as 			well.	Without warning, Jack does a perfectly executed BACK-	FLIP. Impressively, he ends up standing almost exactly 	where he was standing before.					JACK 			Can you do that?					BASHIR			I doubt it.					JACK 			What happened? Your parents 			couldn't afford the full overhaul?	Another giggle from Patrick.					LAUREN 			He turned out all right.					JACK				(giving her a withering 				look) 			You're not exactly known for being 			discriminating.					LAUREN 			I turned you down, didn't I?					JACK 			And you're still regretting it.				(quick, as if to catch 				Bashir off guard) 			The cube root of three hundred 			twenty-nine -- what is it?	Bashir considers whether to respond to this test, 	decides to go ahead.					BASHIR 			Six point nine zero three.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical...

You didn't even use 			your fingers.				(to the others) 			He's a mutant, just like the rest 			of us.					JACK 			No. He's not like us. No. He 			passed as normal.	Patrick comes up to Bashir to ask a question.					PATRICK 			Is it true? You passed as normal? 			Is it true?					BASHIR				(nods) 			My genetic status wasn't 			discovered until last year.					LAUREN 			How'd you manage to hide it for so 			long?	This is a difficult subject for Bashir...					BASHIR 			I did my best not to... exploit my 			abilities.					JACK 			So no one would suspect. Very 			clever. I'm impressed.				(suddenly angry) 			That's not right. There are 			reasons why DNA resequencing is 			illegal. There are reasons why 			people like us are barred from 			serving in Starfleet. We have an 			advantage. Normal people can't 			compete. It's not fair.					BASHIR			Maybe you're right... maybe I 			should've said something sooner.					JACK 			There are rules. Don't talk with 			your mouth full. Don't open an 			airlock when someone's inside. 			Don't lie about your genetic 			status. But you did. You lied.      DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical...

They 			would've put you away.					BASHIR			They don't "put people away" for 			being genetically engineered.					JACK 			No, they just won't let us do 			anything that's worth doing -- 			they're afraid we're going to take 			over.					BASHIR			It happened before. People like 			us did try to take over.					JACK 			I knew it! I knew you were going 			to trot out the Eugenics Wars.					BASHIR			I'm not trotting anything out. 			All I'm saying is that there's a 			reason we're barred from certain 			professions. That doesn't mean we 			can't be productive members of 			society.					JACK 			Here it comes. The "we have 			something to contribute" speech. 				(anger flashing) 			No. No. I will not forget what 			was done to me. I will not be 			part of the society that locked me 			away for being too smart. No.	Bashir turns to look at Lauren, who shrugs that she's 	not interested either. Patrick shakes his head 	vigorously, siding with his friends.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT ONE   12A.12   CONTINUED:	(5)					BASHIR 			All right, then. Since you seem 			to have all the answers, I'll 			spare you the speech.	Bashir wants to let them know that what happens next is 	up to them, so he turns and heads for the door.

Off this moment...13   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Re-establishing.14   INT. SISKO'S QUARTERS	It's after dinner, and SISKO is sitting at the table 	with Bashir, WORF, DAX, KIRA, O'BRIEN and ODO.					BASHIR 			All I kept thinking was "there but 			for the grace of God go I."					DAX			How do you mean?					BASHIR			My parents found a decent doctor 			to perform the DNA resequencing on 			me. These four weren't so lucky.     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT ONE    14.14   CONTINUED:					BASHIR (Cont'd) 			They all suffered unintended side-			effects. By the time they were 			five or six years old, their 			parents had to come forward and 			admit that they'd broken the law 			so their children could get 			treatment.					SISKO			Sounds like they waited too long.					BASHIR 				(agreeing) 			There wasn't much the doctors at 			the Institute could do for them -- 			cases like theirs are so rare 			there's no standard treatment.					KIRA			I can't imagine it was a very 			challenging environment for them.					BASHIR			That's exactly what Doctor Loews 			felt when she first came to the 			Institute. She got permission to 			separate them from the other 			residents so she could work with 			them.					ODO			Why did she bring them here?					BASHIR			She thought they might respond to 			meeting someone who was like them, 			but was living a normal life. 			She's hoping that someday they'll 			be able to live on their own and 			be productive.	O'Brien smiles, shakes his head --     DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT ONE    15.14   CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN 			I hope they don't end up being too			productive -- it'd make the rest 			of us look bad.	O'Brien's lighthearted comment actually strikes to the 	heart of the matter, and Worf seizes on it --					WORF			It is no laughing matter. If 			people like them are allowed to 			compete freely, parents would feel 			pressured to have their children 			enhanced so that they could keep 			up.					ODO				(seeing Worf's point) 			That's precisely what prompted the 			ban on DNA resequencing in the 			first place.	This is Starfleet's party line and Bashir knows it, but 	it's a difficult subject for him. A moment, then he 	tries to calmly explain how he sees it. Despite his 	best efforts, Bashir can't keep the emotion from rising 	in his voice --					BASHIR 			Giving them a chance to contribute 			doesn't mean sanctioning what was 			done to them. They didn't ask to 			have their DNA tampered with -- 			they were just children when it 			happened. Why should they be 			excluded when their parents are 			the ones who broke the law?	An awkward silence settles over the room as the others 	realize Julian is taking the conversation personally. 	Finally, Sisko cautiously tries to smooth things over.					SISKO 			You're right. It's not quite 			fair.

" - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FOUR    44.36   CONTINUED:	(4)					JACK			Fine.	In a sudden motion, he wheels around and DECKS Bashir, 	sending him unconscious to the floor. The others are 	shocked by his sudden act, stand there stunned. Jack 	looks down at Bashir's still form --					LAUREN			How do we contact the Dominion?	And off this moment, we...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                             DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical...

We cut in to find a 	disgruntled Damar sitting at a table, studying a PADD. 	Weyoun ENTERS from the back room and approaches him.					DAMAR 			I've been looking over Sisko's 			latest counterproposal. We don't 			seem to be getting anywhere with 			him.					WEYOUN			Not very encouraging, is it?					DAMAR 				(gruff) 			I don't know why you had me call 			for peace talks in the first 			place.					WEYOUN			My, my -- how quickly you've taken 			to your new role. And to think, 			only a short time ago you were 			nothing more than Gul Dukat's 			adjutant.	Damar hears the displeasure in his tone, tries to 	backpedal.					DAMAR 			I appreciate the faith you've 			shown in me.					WEYOUN			Then show a little faith in me. 			Don't be like your predecessor, 			second-guessing my every move. It 			should be clear to you by now that 			no one is irreplaceable.	His point made, Weyoun moves on --					WEYOUN 			Now... I just received a very 			interesting message from an 			unidentified party claiming to 			have some information that could 			be very beneficial to us.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE   45A.37   CONTINUED:					DAMAR			What sort of information?					WEYOUN 			I don't know... but we're going to 			find out...	And off Damar's reaction...38   INT. CARGO BAY/TEAM DORM 	where we find an unconscious Bashir TIED to a chair. 	After a beat, he rouses himself, looks around. It 	takes him a moment to get his bearings and realize 	what's happened. He looks down, sees that his combadge 	is missing -- tries to activate the computer.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE    46.38   CONTINUED:					BASHIR			Computer.				(no response)			Computer, respond.	Still nothing. After a beat, Bashir notices something 	out of the corner of his eye. It's Sarina, in the 	corner, silent and still as always.					BASHIR			Sarina, where is everyone?	No answer. Bashir looks around, sees that the PADDS 	they've been working with are missing.					BASHIR			Did they arrange a meeting with			the Dominion?	Bashir studies her reaction, but she gives nothing 	away.					BASHIR			Listen to me. We have to stop			them before it's too late.	She says nothing --					BASHIR			Untie me. Please.				(no response)			Sarina.	She says nothing. Frustrated, Bashir struggles to free 	himself. After a few beats, he's surprised to hear a 	small, tremulous voice --					SARINA			I'm sorry.	Bashir reacts to the first words he's ever heard her 	speak, realizing that she must be conflicted if she's 	driven to utter them.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE    47.38   CONTINUED:	(2)	She has to pull herself up from the deep well she's 	lived in for so many years -- she doesn't know how to 	say what she feels, she doesn't even know what she 	feels.					SARINA 			I can't untie you.					BASHIR				(gently) 			Yes, you can. If you think it's 			the right thing to do.					SARINA 				(at a loss) 			I don't know...					BASHIR 			I think you do. I think that's 			why you spoke to me just now. You 			could've stayed quiet, but you 			didn't. And the only reason I can 			think of is that you don't want to 			have the deaths of so many people 			on your hands.					SARINA 			Jack would be mad.	Bashir realizes something about her that he's been 	sensing all along -- seeing an opening, he eases his 	way toward it.					BASHIR				(gently) 			Yes, he would. And I know you 			don't want that to happen.	Bashir sees something flicker across her features, and 	he knows what he's thinking is true --					BASHIR 			I've seen the way you look at him 			when you think no one is watching. 			I know how much you care about 			him.	Sarina looks down, trying to shut out his words. 	Emotion is so alien to her that it's painful for her to 	feel so exposed.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE    48.38   CONTINUED:	(3)					BASHIR 			Sarina, if you don't let me stop 			them, they're going to be arrested 			and charged with treason. Do you 			know what that means? You'll 			never see any of them again. 				(beat) 			You'll never see Jack again.	She looks up, stricken by this thought. Bashir holds 	her gaze, says nothing more. He knows he has to let 	her sit with this for a moment and decide what she 	wants to do. Off Sarina's face as we wonder what 	she'll do...39   INT. SMALL STORAGE BAY	where Damar and Weyoun are waiting in an aisle between 	the CRATES and CONTAINERS.					DAMAR 			Where are they?					WEYOUN			They'll be here.	Damar stews for a moment --					DAMAR 			This is ridiculous. Sneaking into 			a storage bay for a secret meeting --			I'm not some agent in the Obsidian 			Order, I'm the leader of the 			Cardassian Empire.					WEYOUN			Don't let it go to your head. You 			serve at the Dominion's pleasure.	Damar bristles, but doesn't argue with this --					WEYOUN				(smiles)			Besides, I think it's exciting.	Damar rolls his eyes behind Weyoun's back. A moment, 	then the SOUND of a door OPENING off-screen.					WEYOUN 			They're here.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE    49.39   CONTINUED:	Weyoun and Damar step out from the aisle --40   NEW ANGLE	to reveal Odo standing there.					WEYOUN			Odo.					ODO				(dry) 			Yes, I know -- I "honor you" with 			my presence.					WEYOUN 			We seem to have gotten ourselves 			lost.					ODO			Mm-hm.				(beat)			They're not coming.	Damar sees only one way to play this --					DAMAR 			Who's not coming?					ODO			I had a feeling you were going to 			say that.				(beat) 			Shall I escort you to your 			quarters?	Weyoun smiles, nods that that would be most kind. Off the 	moment between them...41   INT. CARGO BAY/TEAM DORM	where Bashir is dealing with an angry Jack. Sarina 	keeps her distance, but Lauren and Patrick are ready to 	confront Bashir for what he's done.					BASHIR 			Captain Sisko has decided not to 			press charges. You're not going 			to prison.					PATRICK 				(scared) 			What are they going to do to us?					BASHIR 			Nothing bad. You'll be sent back 			to the Institute. Together.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE    50.41   CONTINUED:					JACK 			It doesn't matter what happens to 			us. Don't you realize what you've 			done?					BASHIR			I kept you from committing 			treason.					LAUREN 			Are we supposed to thank you? 			Nine hundred billion people are 			going to die.					BASHIR			We don't know that.					JACK				(incredulous) 			Didn't you sit here and go through 			the projections with us? Didn't 			you?					PATRICK 			He was here, Jack. I remember.					BASHIR			Maybe our projections were wrong.					JACK 			How can you say that? We factored 			in every variable, every 			contingency -- the equations don't 			lie!				(pointing at Sarina) 			You. You ruined everything.	The anger in his voice causes her to look down, retreat 	into herself --					BASHIR				(hard) 			What do you make of that, Jack? 			Why didn't you anticipate it -- 			why didn't you factor her into 			your equations?	Jack is momentarily taken off guard, and Bashir presses 	his point --    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE    51.41   CONTINUED:	(2)					BASHIR 			You thought you knew everything, 			but you didn't even know what was 			going to happen in this room.	Jack doesn't know what to say --					BASHIR 			One person derailed your plans. 			One person changed the course of 			history.				(beat) 			I don't know about you, but that 			gives me hope. It makes me think 			that maybe, just maybe, things 			don't have to turn out the way we 			thought.	And with that, Bashir turns and EXITS. Off Jack and 	the others as they take this in...42   EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)	Re-establishing.42A  INT. QUARK'S 	where we find Bashir alone at the bar, lost in thought. 	SUPERNUMERARIES as needed. O'Brien ENTERS and 	approaches him. He can see his friend is somber, and 	he thinks he knows why.					O'BRIEN 			I heard what happened.	Bashir nods, trying to make sense of it all.					O'BRIEN			It was a pretty close call.					BASHIR 			Luckily Odo managed to intercept 			them in time.					O'BRIEN			That's not what I meant.	Bashir looks at him, unsure what he means --    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE   51A.42A  CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN 			I'm talking about when you had to 			decide whether or not to meet with 			the Dominion. I'm sure it wasn't 			easy -- I know you wanted to try 			to save as many lives as possible. 				(smiles) 			It's probably what makes you such 			a good doctor.					BASHIR 			Fortunately this doctor's also a 			Starfleet Officer.	Bashir mulls it over for a moment --					BASHIR 			We thought we were so smart. We 			actually believed we could predict 			the future. 				(beat) 			It's my fault, not theirs. I 			should never have let things go so 			far. I guess I was just too bent 			on proving to the world that they 			have something to contribute.	O'Brien considers for a beat...					O'BRIEN 			They did contribute, Julian. 				(off Bashir's look) 			Seems to me we were starting to 			get a little too complacent about 			the Dominion. We may have driven 			them back into Cardassian space, 			but that doesn't mean we've beaten 			them.	Bashir looks at his friend, grateful for his 	perspective...					BASHIR			I only hope we can...					O'BRIEN 			The odds may not be good, but all 			we can do is take our best shot.	And with that, O'Brien moves away. A beat as Bashir 	considers his words, then he turns and heads for the 	Dabo table...    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE   51B.43   INTERIOR QUARK'S -- LATER	as Quark crosses toward Bashir, who's standing at the 	Dabo table with some other PLAYERS.					QUARK 			You're not going to cause any 			more trouble, are you?					BASHIR			Not this time.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE    52.43   CONTINUED:					BASHIR (Cont'd)				(to dabo girl)			I'll double down.	Quark reacts -- this doesn't strike him as a smart way 	to play.					QUARK 			Risky...					BASHIR 			Maybe there's a better bet, but 			when the odds are stacked against 			you, sometimes you just have to 			take a chance.					QUARK				(confident of the 				house's odds) 			I admire your courage...	The wheel spins to a stop --					VOICES 			Dabo!	Bashir's congratulated from all sides... he smiles, 	shakes his head as if to say "go figure."					QUARK				(depressed) 			Well, what do you know... we have 			a winner...	And with that, he crosses away. O'Brien's com voice 	cuts in --					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE 			O'Brien to Bashir.					BASHIR 			Go ahead.					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE 			You wanted to know when a certain 			transport was leaving.	Bashir takes this in, and the thought of parting on 	such bad terms with the team brings him down.					BASHIR 			Thanks.    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical... " - REV. 10/23/97 - ACT FIVE    53.43A  CONTINUED:	(2)					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE 			There's one problem, though. 			We've got some passengers that are 			refusing to board unless you come 			see them.	Off Bashir's reaction...44   INT. CARGO BAY/TEAM DORM (OPTICAL)	where Bashir is saying good-bye to Lauren, Patrick and 	Sarina. Jack is in his room, refusing to come out and 	see Bashir.					BASHIR 			I didn't think you'd want to see 			me again.					LAUREN 			Believe me, I wouldn't mind if our 			projections turned out to be 			wrong.	Lauren inclines her head in the direction of Jack's 	room, where we see him peeking out -- as soon as he 	sees them look his way, he pops back out of view.					LAUREN 			Jack's still furious, but I didn't 			want to leave without saying 			good-bye.	She leans in, gives him a big kiss smack on the mouth. 	Bashir is so taken off guard, he just accepts it as 	best he can. She pulls away, smiles...					PATRICK 			Will you come visit us?					BASHIR 			I'd like that.	Bashir moves to Sarina, who's sitting nearby, leans in 	close...					BASHIR 				(sotto) 			You did the right thing. Someday 			he'll realize that.	She looks at him, almost smiles, hoping it's true. 	Bashir turns back to the others.					BASHIR 			Ready to go?    DEEP SPACE NINE: "Statistical...

There's something I 			need to know, doctor.	For a moment, we think he's going to lay into Bashir --					JACK 			If we can come up with a way to 			beat the Dominion, will you 			listen?	Bashir breaks into a grin --					BASHIR 			I can't think of anything I'd like 			better.					JACK 			Good.				(rounding up the others) 			Let's go, let's go. We've got 			work to do.	Bashir smiles, taps his combadge.					BASHIR 			Bashir to O'Brien.				(beat)			Four to beam out.	As they DEMATERIALIZE, Lauren shoots Bashir a wink. 	Once they're gone, Bashir takes a beat and looks around 	the room.
